    "abstract": "Abstract Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan.Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG-/-) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.Results C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated.Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.Keywords: Sarcoglycan, Sarcoglycanopathies, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Mechanotransduction, Mechano-sensing, Load-sensing, p70S6K, S6K, p70S6 kinase, ERK1/2",

    "methods": "Methods Animals Adult C57BL/6 (C57) and γ-SG-null (γ-SG-/-) mice were used. For ex vivo protocols, mice were aged 8 to 16 weeks. The γ-SG-/- mouse lacks γ-SG due to gene targeting, resulting in an additional loss of β- and δ-SG and a decrease of α-SG [9]. All experiments were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C2C12 myotube culture Flexible silicone membranes (Specialty Manufacturing, Inc.) were stretched across the bottom of custom cylinders which acted as a culture chamber. The membranes were held in place using an O-ring as described previously [40]. Membranes were then coated with a thin layer of 2 mg/mL GFR Matrigel (BD #354230). C2C12 myoblasts (3.5 × 105/cylinder) were seeded onto the membranes and maintained at 5% CO2 at 37°C in growth media (10% FBS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 100 μg/mL gentamycin in DMEM) for approximately 24 h until 70% to 80% confluent, then switched to differentiation media (2% HS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in DMEM). Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes for 5 days, during which media was changed every other day before stretching as described below. Primary myoblast culture Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles were dissected and incubated with 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Sigma), 10% FBS in Tyrode’s solution (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES (all from Fisher), 5.5 mM glucose (Sigma), pH 7.4) for 90 min at 37°C, with shaking, as previously described [41]. Muscles were washed in 10% FBS in Tyrode’s solution and clumps of fibers were liberated by pipetting up and down in 10% FBS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin in Tyrode’s solution using a wide-mouthed glass pipette. Clumps of fibers were transferred to a second dish with the same solution and pipetted up and down again. Single fibers were transferred to a third dish before plating on silicone membranes coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson; 2 mg/mL diluted in DMEM). Growth media (20% FBS, 10 ng/mL mouse basic fibroblast growth factor (MP Bio), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 1 μg/mL Fungizone, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in Ham’s F-10 media) was carefully added and cultures were incubated without disturbance for 3 days at 37°C. Media was then changed every 2 days. After 7 to 10 days, when myoblast cultures were 70% to 80% confluent, media was switched to differentiation media (10% HS, 0.5% chicken embryo extract, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 1 μg/mL Fungizone, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in DMEM) and myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes for 5 days before stretching as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco. Myotube stretching protocol C2C12 myotubes were stretched using an apparatus that produces isotropic two-dimensional strain of cells in vitro, as described previously [40]. Briefly, myotubes were subjected to 10% strain, 40 times per minute, for 30 min, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Control myotubes were treated identically but were not stretched. Lysates were harvested immediately as described below. Primary myotubes were stretched using the protocol described for C2C12 myotubes. Stretched myotubes were then incubated without stretch for a further 1, 2, or 4 h at 37°C before harvesting lysates for immunoblotting as described below. Control (non-stretched) myotubes were harvested immediately after the end of the stretching protocol used for the stretched myotubes. Isolated muscle stretching protocol Mice were anaesthetized using ketamine and xylazine. EDL muscles were dissected and placed in an organ bath containing oxygenated high-glucose (25 mM) DMEM with HEPES (25 mM) (Life Technologies), at room temperature. For rapamycin sensitivity experiments, high-glucose DMEM was supplemented with 150 nM rapamycin (Sigma) or vehicle only (0.1% DMSO). Muscles were adjusted to 9.3 mN of resting tension, approximately equivalent to optimal length, based on our previous experiments [42]. After a 10-min equilibration period, the length of the muscle was measured using calipers, and the muscle was subjected to a stretching protocol of 15% strain (held for 100 ms with ramp times of 50 ms), 20 times per minute, for either 30 or 90 min, using an in vitro muscle test system (Aurora Scientific). Muscles were snap-frozen immediately following the end of the stretch protocol. Contralateral muscles were used as controls and were adjusted to the same length as the stretched muscles, then incubated in oxygenated high-glucose DMEM with HEPES at room temperature for the equivalent length of time, before snap-freezing. Calcium dependence experiments EDL muscles were dissected as described above and placed in an organ bath contained oxygenated Ringer’s solution (119 mM NaCl, 4.74 mM KCl, 2.54 mM CaCl2, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.18 mM MgSO4, 25 mM HEPES, 2.75 mM glucose), calcium-free Ringer’s solution (CaCl2 replaced with 2.5 mM MgCl2) or Ringer’s solution supplemented with 100 μM tetracaine. They were incubated for 30 min before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Muscle lysates containing 100 μg total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-P-tyrosine (Cell Signaling #9411 1:100) overnight at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. Samples were purified using Protein A/G Plus Agarose beads (Roche) for 1 h at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. The immune complex was eluted with non-reducing sample buffer and boiled at 100°C for 5 min before being applied to a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred, and immunoblotted as described below. Immunoblotting C2C12 and primary myotubes were washed with ice-cold PBS before lysing in 100 to 200 μL of RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 15 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium hexahydral, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 0.025% sodium azide) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatants retained. EDL muscles were ground using a dry ice-cooled pestle and mortar, and lysed in 200 μL of RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h, vortexing half-way through, centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatants retained. Protein content was determined using a Bradford method protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates (30 μg total protein for myotube cultures, 90 μg total protein for EDL muscles) were separated by SDS-PAGE on Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TTBS (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween-20, pH 8), with 2% BSA added for some antibodies, then probed with antibodies to the following: phospho (P)-p70S6K (T389) (Cell Signaling #9205 1:200 for primary cultures, Cell Signaling #9234 1:250 for isolated muscles), P-p70S6K (T421/S424) (Cell Signaling #9204 1:1,000), P-S6RP (Cell Signaling #2211 1:2,000), P-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101 1:500), total (T)-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9107 1:1,000), P-Akt (Cell Signaling #9271 1:300), T-Akt (Cell Signaling #2920 1:2,000), P-FAK (Millipore 05-1140, 1:500), T-FAK (Millipore 06-543, 1:1,000), γ-SG (Novocastra VP-G803 1:300), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Santa Cruz sc-32233 1:5,000), and tubulin (Sigma T5168 1:20,000). Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant TL, 1D gel analysis (C2C12 and myotube cultures, rapamycin sensitivity experiments) or ImageJ () (all other isolated muscles). P-p70S6K and P-S6RP were normalized to either GAPDH or tubulin, P-FAK was normalized to either T-FAK or GAPDH, P-Akt was normalized to T-Akt, and P-ERK1/2 was normalized to T-ERK1/2.

Comparisons between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles in calcium experiments (Figure 3) were done by unpaired T test. Comparisons between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles with and without stretch for each time point (Figure 4) or with and without rapamycin (Figure 5) were done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

    "results": "Results p70S6K, but not ERK1/2 or Akt responds to passive stretch in vitro Studies using whole muscles from animal models of the dystrophies are made more complex by the presence of multiple cell types, as well as pathological processes such as fibrosis. Therefore, we initially investigated mechanotransduction signaling in passively stretched C2C12 myotubes. We found that passive stretching in vitro did not alter phosphorylation of ERK1 or Akt and that ERK2 and FAK phosphorylation decreased following stretch (Figure 1A,C-F,H-I). However, we found an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation at T389, which reflects activity, in response to passive stretching of C2C12 myotubes (Figure 1B,G). Therefore, this in vitro model reflected some, but not all, stretch responses observed in muscle in vivo[43,44], and highlighted p70S6K as a pathway of interest. The lack of Akt phosphorylation suggests that p70S6K phosphorylation occurred through an Akt-independent pathway, while the lack of FAK phosphorylation supports an integrin-independent mechanism. Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in C57 and γ-SG-/- primary cultures Having established pathways of interest in vitro using the C2C12 cell line, we used primary myoblast cultures from C57 and γ-SG-/- mice (Figure 2A) to investigate the changes in mechanotransduction signaling associated solely with the loss of the SG complex in myofibers. C57 and γ-SG-/- cultures were stretched for 30 min as described above and lysates were harvested 1, 2, or 4 h after stretching ended, to allow observation of the signaling time course. Immunoblotting analysis showed that there was no difference in basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation between C57 and γ-SG-/- myotubes and little change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to stretch (Figure 2B,D,E). Therefore, similar to the C2C12 cells, primary cultures did not reflect the ERK1/2 phosphorylation responses found previously in C57 and γ-SG-/- mice in vivo[10,11]. Neither P-Akt nor P-FAK displayed significant differences between C57 and γ-SG-/- cultures (Figure 2B,F,G). Further, these proteins did not show any prolonged response to passive stretch in the primary cultures, consistent with the lack of an acute positive stretch response in C2C12 cells. Examination of p70S6K revealed a trend towards elevated T389 phosphorylation at baseline in γ-SG-/- myotubes, compared to C57 myotubes. Activation of p70S6K in γ-SG-/- myotubes upon stretch was not apparent (Figure 2B,C), but C57 myotubes displayed a trend for increased activation at 2 and 4 h after stretching (Figure 2B,C). Therefore, while the primary cultures reflect some of the responses found in C2C12 myotubes, the experimental system is too variable to draw firm conclusions regarding mechanical signaling pathways associated with γ-SG. Elevated P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles is calcium independent Our experiments in myotubes, together with our previous studies in isolated muscles [10,11], suggested that ERK1/2 phosphorylation changes require active contraction in addition to stretch, whereas p70S6K responds to stretch alone. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we extended our analysis to examine the response of p70S6K to passive stretch of isolated muscles. P-p70S6k was elevated approximately 1.7-fold in resting γ-SG-/- EDL muscles incubated in normal oxygenated Ringer’s solution (Figure 3C; Normal). As in our previous studies, there was a 3- and 1.5-fold increase of P-ERK1 and P-ERK2, respectively, in resting γ-SG-/- EDL muscles (Figure 3A-B; Normal). Because both of these pathways converge to phosphorylate S6RP, we compared the phosphorylation state of this protein in muscles from both genotypes. γ-SG-/- EDL muscles exhibited an 8-fold increase in P-S6RP, which was consistent with the higher basal phosphorylation state of the upstream pathways (Figure 3D; Normal). Heightened mechanosensitive signaling could arise through increased flux of ions across the sarcolemma, particularly Ca2+[17]. This could occur either through enhanced activity of channels, such as the TRP family of cation channels (reviewed in [28,29]), or via membrane ruptures. To determine the calcium dependence of the observed differences in p70S6K and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in γ-SG-/- muscles, we incubated muscles in calcium-free Ringers solution, retaining the same ionic strength. Absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter the relative difference in P-p70S6K between γ-SG-/- and C57 muscles (Figure 3C). However, the increased P-ERK1/2 and P-S6RP found in γ-SG-/- muscles in normal Ringer’s solution was abrogated when there was no calcium in the bathing solution (Figure 3A,B,D). Thus, only p70S6K phosphorylation appeared to be calcium independent. Because intracellular calcium stores can also alter the intracellular calcium concentration, particularly during muscle activation, tetracaine was used to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptors. Verification of this inhibition was established in a separate experiment, through measuring tetanic force generation by EDL muscles before and after addition of tetracaine. After 15 min incubation with tetracaine, force production was virtually eliminated (force was 297 mN prior to addition of tetracaine, 2.4 mN after 15 min incubation with tetracaine and not detectable after 20 min incubation with tetracaine). Again, relative P-p70S6K levels between the two muscle groups were not altered by tetracaine (Figure 3C). In contrast, blockade of SR Ca2+ release reduced P-ERK1 levels in γ-SG-/- muscles relative to C57 muscles, even though there was no alteration in P-ERK2 (Figure 3A,B). Phosphorylation of S6RP remained elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles in the presence of tetracaine, but to a lesser extent than in normal Ringer’s solution (Figure 3D). Taken together, both extracellular and intracellular calcium contribute to the heightened P-ERK1 levels in γ-SG-/- muscles, whereas the increase in basal P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles is not dependent on either extracellular or intracellular calcium. Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in isolated C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles Having established that P-p70S6K changes at rest did not depend on calcium, we pursued the role of p70S6K in γ-SG-dependent mechanotransduction in vivo. A passive stretching protocol comprised of a 15% strain, 20 times per min, for 30 min in high-glucose DMEM was sufficient to cause increased γ-SG phosphorylation in the EDL, as is the case for eccentric contraction of the EDL (Figure 4A; [10]). We stretched C57 and γ-SG-/- EDL muscles for either 30 or 90 min and immediately snap-froze them in liquid nitrogen. We then used immunoblotting to measure phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389, as above, and also at T421/S424 in the auto-inhibitory domain. Basal phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 showed a trend to be increased in unstretched γ-SG-/- muscles compared to C57 muscles (Figure 4B,C). However, basal phosphorylation at T421/S424 was not different between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles (Figure 4D). After 30 min of stretch, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 and T421/S424 was increased to a similar degree in stretched C57 and γ-SG-/- EDL muscles, compared to non-stretched controls. However, after 90 min of stretch, phosphorylation at T389 and T421/S424 had decreased in stretched C57 muscles and was close to non-stretched levels. In contrast, phosphorylation at T389 was further increased, and T421/S424 phosphorylation remained elevated, in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, compared to non-stretched controls (Figure 4B-D). For T389 phosphorylation after 90 min of stretch, genotype, stretch, and the interaction between them were all statistically significant, by two-way ANOVA. T421/S424 showed a similar trend to T389; however, while the effect of stretch was statistically significant, the difference between genotypes was not. Thus, in contrast to primary cultures, γ-SG-/- muscles exhibited heightened and prolonged activation of p70S6K in response to passive stretch, implying that γ-SG plays a role in p70S6K inactivation. Stretch response of p70S6K T389, but not S6RP, is rapamycin-sensitive in γ-SG-/- muscles Because mTOR is a key mediator of p70S6K activation, we examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on stretch responses in isolated C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. EDL muscles were subjected to cyclic stretch for 90 min, as described above. Unlike in C2C12 cells and primary cultures, P-Akt showed a trend to increase on stretching, which was statistically significant in γ-SG-/- muscles. As anticipated, P-Akt was unaffected by rapamycin (Figure 5A,B). Rapamycin treatment completely blocked the increase in p70S6K T389 phosphorylation after passive stretch of C57 muscles, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. In γ-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin abrogated most p70S6K T389 phosphorylation, but residual phosphorylation remained in stretched muscles (Figure 5A,C). T421/S424 showed a trend to increase in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. Surprisingly, rapamycin blunted the p70S6K T421/S424 stretch response in C57 muscles, which is inconsistent with previous studies [36]. However, the T421/S424 response to stretch persisted in γ-SG-/- muscles in the presence of rapamycin (Figure 5A,D). S6RP phosphorylation increased in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. Interestingly, while rapamycin blocked stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP in C57 muscles, phosphorylation in response to stretch was preserved in γ-SG-/- muscles (Figure 5A,E). Taken together, these results suggest either that the level of active p70S6K remaining in γ-SG-/- muscles is sufficient to phosphorylate S6RP regardless of rapamycin or that an alternate pathway bypasses p70S6K to phosphorylate S6RP in muscles lacking γ-SG.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Skeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in workload. Almost all muscle properties can be modulated, such as muscle fiber size, contractile properties and metabolism. Changes in patterns of gene expression as well as shifts in the balance between protein synthesis and degradation are required to complete the adaptational response. Identification of major pathways that directly regulate gene expression and protein synthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs (mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge on final common pathways for muscle growth and adaptation (reviewed in [45]). However, sorting out the contribution of the wide variety of inputs on muscle adaptation has been more difficult. In our previous work, we used an eccentric contraction protocol to investigate the dependence of ERK1/2 mechano-sensing on phosphorylation of γ-SG. However, this protocol alters multiple factors, including externally applied tension, internally generated tension and changes in extracellular and intracellular calcium fluxes, all of which potentially have effects on mechanosensitive signaling pathways. In the present study, we used a passive stretching protocol to isolate the effects of externally applied tension in the absence of active contraction, in order to examine the downstream signaling in more detail. Passive stretching protocols can be performed in both cell cultures and whole muscle preparations, and the reductionist approach of utilizing cultures can eliminate some of the physiological complexities associated with intact or isolated muscles. As such, our initial experiments using C2C12 cells were key to identifying p70S6K as being activated in response to stretch, in contrast to the lack of response by ERK1/2, Akt, or FAK. Primary myotubes generated from C57 or γ-SG-/- mice had the distinct advantage of efficient germline elimination of γ-SG combined with an in vitro culture system. Even though these experiments displayed trends towards differential activation of p70S6K after stretch, the inherent variability of the preparation impaired identification of signaling patterns that were dependent upon either stretch or γ-SG. Thus, we returned to isolated muscles from C57 and γ-SG-/- mice to investigate γ-SG-dependent mechanotransduction pathways. Using this model, we observed a modest increase of P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles at rest that was independent of intra- or extracellular calcium, and a prolonged activation of p70S6K following stretch. These results support a role for γ-SG in particular, or the SG complex in general, in mechanical signal transduction, where the loss of this protein leads to an increase in activation, and deficit in deactivation, or a combination of both. Given the dependence of our findings on the experimental platform utilized, future directions will include verification of the results in an even more intact system, such as in situ muscle preparations or whole animals. An intriguing explanation for our in vivo results is that γ-SG is required for dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K. There is considerable evidence that p70S6K is directly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), independently of mTOR [46-49]. The phosphatase PHLPP has also been shown to target p70S6K [50]. γ-SG may mediate the activation of these phosphatases in response to sustained mechanical stimulation. Alternatively, γ-SG may regulate pathways that deactivate p70S6K indirectly. For example, the phosphatase SHP-2 can cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K [51,52]. Further studies will be required to define the inactivation pathway disrupted by γ-SG loss. Passive stretch eliminates the contribution of active contraction or SR calcium fluxes, but does not eliminate the effects of extracellular Ca2+ fluxes through mechanically sensitive channels. Further, as previously shown, passive stretch causes greater Ca2+ influx into myotubes lacking members of the SG complex [17], raising the possibility that the mechanical signal transduction pathways we evaluated previously may be modulated not only by the SG complex, but also by additional channels in the sarcolemma. To address this, we examined the contribution of calcium to the elevated p70S6K and ERK1/2 activity found in γ-SG-/- muscles. We found that the elevation of P-ERK1/2 in the absence of γ-SG was dependent on both internal and external sources of calcium. In contrast, the difference in basal P-p70S6K between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles was not calcium dependent. This suggests that while ERK1/2 activation may lie downstream of the calcium misregulation that occurs in SG-deficient muscle, changes in p70S6K activation may be a more direct consequence of the absence of the SG complex. This is of great interest given that γ-SG has been shown to be important for mechanotransduction, but the downstream signaling pathways are uncharacterized [10,11]. Furthermore, p70S6K has been implicated in mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle, but the upstream initiation signals are not known [36,53-55]. However, it should be noted that SG-deficient muscle undergoes substantial degeneration and subsequent regeneration, which may also explain the elevated basal p70S6K, which is transiently increased during regeneration [56]. Our study found that the pattern of differential p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch in γ-SG-/- muscles was similar both for phosphorylation of T389, which correlates with kinase activity, and for T421/S424, two of the four phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain. Phosphorylation of T389 is mTOR-dependent, while phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is carried out by proline-directed kinases. Furthermore, it is thought that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is necessary for phosphorylation of T389 [37]. The correlation between phosphorylation of T421/S424 and T389 in our isolated muscle model therefore suggests that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain was the rate-limiting step for p70S6K activation, an intriguing prospect given that the autoinhibitory domain may be targeted by ERK1/2 [57]. Therefore, a future hypothesis to test is that differential p70S6K activation is a downstream consequence of differential ERK1/2 activation in γ-SG-/- muscle. This would implicate Ca2+ as an indirect modulator of p70S6K activity, since the increase in P-ERK1/2 in γ-SG-/- muscle is dependent upon heightened Ca2+ flux. It is worth noting that recent work by others has shown that stretch-induced activation of mTOR and p70S6K at T389 is independent of ERK1/2 [54], which can regulate mTOR via tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 and Raptor [58-60]. However, this pathway is separate from the putative direct phosphorylation of the p70S6K T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites by ERK1/2. Our experiments with rapamycin showed that, for both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mTOR-dependent, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. The T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites were phosphorylated in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles, which was different to our initial experiment in stretched isolated muscles, where the C57 response had diminished by 90 min of stretching. However, in the presence of rapamycin, this response was not present. This is surprising given that the T421/S424 sites are not thought to be targeted by mTOR. Previous studies have shown these sites to be rapamycin-insensitive [36], but recent evidence suggests a modest mTOR dependence [61]. In γ-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin had no effect on T421/S424 phosphorylation. Further experiments are needed to fully understand the role of mTOR on phosphorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain in C57 and γ-SG-/- skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP was rapamycin sensitive in C57 muscles, but not in γ-SG-/- muscles. This suggests that an alternative pathway can bring about S6RP phosphorylation in γ-SG-/- muscles when p70S6K is not activated. One possibility is that S6RP is phosphorylated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which is activated by ERK; this is consistent with the increase in basal ERK1/2 in γ-SG-/- muscles, and the over-response of ERK2 on mechanical stimulation by eccentric contraction [10]. We did not observe a strong Akt response to passive stretch, or any difference between C57 and γSG-/-, implying that mTOR and/or p70S6K were being activated through Akt-independent pathways. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Akt does not respond to mechanical stimulation in skeletal muscle, and that p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch is independent of PI3K [62]. We also did not see increased phosphorylation of FAK in response to passive stretch in C2C12 cells or primary myotubes. Although integrins can participate in mechanotransduction, it appears that our cyclic passive stretch protocols did not cause integrin activation. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and integrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the role of calcium in these signaling cascades.Based on our findings, we position γSG as a mechanosensor, schematized in Figure 6, that is important for transient ERK1/2 activation during active contractions, as well as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive stretch. Because passive stretch does not appear to increase P-FAK or P-Akt, γSG is likely to regulate p70S6K through other pathways. These may include regulation of ERK1/2, which can promote p70S6K activation indirectly via mTOR or directly by phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain, and/or phosphatases such as PP2A that dephosphorylate p70S6K. Loss of γSG uncouples the response to stretch, which may contribute to muscle pathology. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Relevant signaling pathways and relationship to γ-SG. Schematic of signaling pathways measured or discussed in this manuscript. Dotted lines indicate possible relationships to γ-SG. Arrowheads indicate an activating relationship, while blunt ends indicate a repressing relationship. Dashed line indicates priming, rather than full activation. The stability of the SG complex is directly affected in several LGMDs and in DMD, and a significant part of the pathology in these diseases appears to be inappropriate load sensing. The first step in therapeutic development is identifying and understanding the target, but little is currently known about the role of the SG complex in load sensing. Therefore, understanding the functions that are disrupted and the pathways that are involved in mechanotransduction involving the SG complex will help in the design of therapies for LGMDs and DMD. While restoration of a completely normal SG complex either through gene correction or protein replacement would also normalize mechanical signal transduction, this may not be possible for all mutations responsible for DMD and LGMD. It is known that localization of the SG complex is not the sole criterion for appropriate signaling [11]. Hence, other proteins may be necessary to correct signaling even when the complex is restored, and downstream pathways may emerge as more feasible therapeutic targets. We do not know whether the enhanced basal and stretch-responsive activation of p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscle contributes to pathology or compensates for it. Likewise, it is not clear whether inhibition of p70S6K would have a beneficial or a detrimental effect in dystrophic muscle. Muscle specific gene targeting of mTORC1 components induces myopathy [63,64] and overexpression of integrin α7 can improve the dystrophic phenotype through increased survival signaling via p70S6K [65], suggesting that p70S6K inhibition would not be advantageous. However, treatment of mdx mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin improves the dystrophic phenotype [66]. It is also interesting to note that p70S6K is inhibited by glucocorticoids, which are used in the treatment of DMD and LGMD [67]. Our results begin to provide mechanistic insight into how mechanical signaling is disrupted and altered in the absence of γ-SG. In addition to increasing our understanding of the normal function of the SG complex, there is potential to provide more refined targets that could be beneficial to patients either in isolation or in combination with other therapeutic approaches.",

Copyright notice ID: 4095884 PMID: 25024843 Abstract Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan.Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG-/-) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.Results C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated.Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.Keywords: Sarcoglycan, Sarcoglycanopathies, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Mechanotransduction, Mechano-sensing, Load-sensing, p70S6K, S6K, p70S6 kinase, ERK1/2Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is found at the sarcolemma of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, where it physically links the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the intracellular cytoskeleton, providing structural support [1-3]. Mutations in DGC components cause different types of muscular dystrophy; for example, mutations in dystrophin cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), while mutations in α-, β-, γ-, or δ-sarcoglycan (SG) cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) [2-4]. When dystrophin is mutated in DMD or in the mdx mouse model of DMD, the entire DGC is substantially reduced at the sarcolemma. In contrast, when any one of the SGs is mutated, in LGMD or any of the SG knock-out mice, the other three SGs are either absent or reduced at the sarcolemma, but the rest of the DGC remains, including the link formed by dystrophin and dystroglycan between the ECM and the cytoskeleton [2,3,5,6]. Unlike the skeletal muscles of the mdx mouse, muscles of the γ-SG knock-out (γ-SG-/-) mouse display no mechanical fragility, at least until 4 months of age, as shown by a minimal loss of force-generating capacity following a series of eccentric contractions (ECCs) [7,8]. In spite of this, the γ-SG-/- mouse exhibits a severe dystrophic phenotype on histological examination, with extensive myofiber degeneration and regeneration, fibrosis, and disruption of sarcolemmal integrity, similar to the mdx mouse [9]. The lack of mechanical fragility suggests that aberrant signaling may contribute to the muscle degeneration seen in the γ-SG-/- mouse. Indeed, our previous studies demonstrated that localization of the SG complex to the sarcolemma and phosphorylation of the tyrosine 6 residue of γ-SG are essential for normal signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), in response to ECCs [10,11]. Based upon these data, we have asserted that the SG complex acts as a mechanosensor in skeletal muscle because of its position within the DGC, the modifications that occur to γ-SG with mechanical perturbation, and the necessity of the complex for normal signaling. A complication of using ECCs to invoke signal transduction is that there are multiple processes in play. Not only is there externally applied tension on the sarcolemma and DGC as a result of lengthening, but also active contraction resulting in internally applied tension and Ca2+ flux within the fibers and across the sarcolemma, all of which could contribute to alterations in signaling in the absence of γ-SG. Calcium is known to be involved in many mechanosensitive signaling pathways (reviewed in [12,13]) and aberrant calcium regulation is a feature of SG-deficient muscle [14-22]. Indeed, an exaggerated ERK1/2 response to mechanical stimulation that is dependent on extracellular calcium has been demonstrated in the mdx mouse diaphragm [23]. Studies suggest that aberrant calcium regulation in the muscular dystrophies results from abnormal levels and activity of the mechanosensitive TRP channels and/or misregulation of store operated calcium entry via the STIM1 and Orai1 channels [24-29]. Direct disruption of the sarcolemma, for which there is evidence in SG-null animal models [7,9,30,31], could also contribute to loss of calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, several strategies to improve Ca2+ handling are known to counteract the pathology associated with the muscular dystrophies [25,32-34]. Therefore, identification of mechanosensitive signaling that is attributable to the SG complex rather than other processes occurring during mechanical perturbation has been challenging. One pathway of interest involves p70S6K, which is canonically activated in response to mitogens via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (reviewed in [35]) and is known to respond to mechanical load [36]. Activation of p70S6K involves a hierarchical series of phosphorylation events, beginning with phosphorylation of multiple sites in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, followed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent phosphorylation of sites in the linker region, which allows for full activation of the kinase via phosphorylation of threonine 229 (T229) in the catalytic domain by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (reviewed in [37]). Although phosphorylation of T229 is required for p70S6K activation, phosphorylation of T389 in the linker region has been found to correlate most closely with in vivo activity [38], and can be used as a measure of kinase activation. p70S6K has a multitude of downstream targets, with roles in protein synthesis, growth, proliferation, survival, and more [35], including S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), which closely correlates with protein translation rates [39]. In the current study, we examined ERK1/2, Akt, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and p70S6K responses to passive stretch in C57 and γ-SG-/- skeletal muscle to further elucidate the importance of the SG complex for mechanotransduction. While differences in ERK1/2 phosphorylation between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscle were calcium-dependent, differences in p70S6K activation were independent of calcium. In addition, the p70S6K response to stretch in both primary myofiber cultures and isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles was differentially regulated in the absence of γ-SG. Specifically, experiments in isolated muscles suggest that γ-SG is required for inactivation of p70S6K. The findings increase our understanding of the contribution of aberrant load-sensing to the pathology of muscular dystrophies where the SG complex is deficient.Methods Animals Adult C57BL/6 (C57) and γ-SG-null (γ-SG-/-) mice were used. For ex vivo protocols, mice were aged 8 to 16 weeks. The γ-SG-/- mouse lacks γ-SG due to gene targeting, resulting in an additional loss of β- and δ-SG and a decrease of α-SG [9]. All experiments were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.C2C12 myotube culture Flexible silicone membranes (Specialty Manufacturing, Inc.) were stretched across the bottom of custom cylinders which acted as a culture chamber. The membranes were held in place using an O-ring as described previously [40]. Membranes were then coated with a thin layer of 2 mg/mL GFR Matrigel (BD #354230). C2C12 myoblasts (3.5 × 105/cylinder) were seeded onto the membranes and maintained at 5% CO2 at 37°C in growth media (10% FBS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 100 μg/mL gentamycin in DMEM) for approximately 24 h until 70% to 80% confluent, then switched to differentiation media (2% HS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in DMEM). Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes for 5 days, during which media was changed every other day before stretching as described below.Primary myoblast culture Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles were dissected and incubated with 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Sigma), 10% FBS in Tyrode’s solution (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES (all from Fisher), 5.5 mM glucose (Sigma), pH 7.4) for 90 min at 37°C, with shaking, as previously described [41]. Muscles were washed in 10% FBS in Tyrode’s solution and clumps of fibers were liberated by pipetting up and down in 10% FBS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin in Tyrode’s solution using a wide-mouthed glass pipette. Clumps of fibers were transferred to a second dish with the same solution and pipetted up and down again. Single fibers were transferred to a third dish before plating on silicone membranes coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson; 2 mg/mL diluted in DMEM). Growth media (20% FBS, 10 ng/mL mouse basic fibroblast growth factor (MP Bio), 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 1 μg/mL Fungizone, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in Ham’s F-10 media) was carefully added and cultures were incubated without disturbance for 3 days at 37°C. Media was then changed every 2 days. After 7 to 10 days, when myoblast cultures were 70% to 80% confluent, media was switched to differentiation media (10% HS, 0.5% chicken embryo extract, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 1 μg/mL Fungizone, 100 μg/mL Gentamycin in DMEM) and myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes for 5 days before stretching as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco.Myotube stretching protocol C2C12 myotubes were stretched using an apparatus that produces isotropic two-dimensional strain of cells in vitro, as described previously [40]. Briefly, myotubes were subjected to 10% strain, 40 times per minute, for 30 min, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Control myotubes were treated identically but were not stretched. Lysates were harvested immediately as described below. Primary myotubes were stretched using the protocol described for C2C12 myotubes. Stretched myotubes were then incubated without stretch for a further 1, 2, or 4 h at 37°C before harvesting lysates for immunoblotting as described below. Control (non-stretched) myotubes were harvested immediately after the end of the stretching protocol used for the stretched myotubes.Isolated muscle stretching protocol Mice were anaesthetized using ketamine and xylazine. EDL muscles were dissected and placed in an organ bath containing oxygenated high-glucose (25 mM) DMEM with HEPES (25 mM) (Life Technologies), at room temperature. For rapamycin sensitivity experiments, high-glucose DMEM was supplemented with 150 nM rapamycin (Sigma) or vehicle only (0.1% DMSO). Muscles were adjusted to 9.3 mN of resting tension, approximately equivalent to optimal length, based on our previous experiments [42]. After a 10-min equilibration period, the length of the muscle was measured using calipers, and the muscle was subjected to a stretching protocol of 15% strain (held for 100 ms with ramp times of 50 ms), 20 times per minute, for either 30 or 90 min, using an in vitro muscle test system (Aurora Scientific). Muscles were snap-frozen immediately following the end of the stretch protocol. Contralateral muscles were used as controls and were adjusted to the same length as the stretched muscles, then incubated in oxygenated high-glucose DMEM with HEPES at room temperature for the equivalent length of time, before snap-freezing.Calcium dependence experiments EDL muscles were dissected as described above and placed in an organ bath contained oxygenated Ringer’s solution (119 mM NaCl, 4.74 mM KCl, 2.54 mM CaCl2, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.18 mM MgSO4, 25 mM HEPES, 2.75 mM glucose), calcium-free Ringer’s solution (CaCl2 replaced with 2.5 mM MgCl2) or Ringer’s solution supplemented with 100 μM tetracaine. They were incubated for 30 min before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Muscle lysates containing 100 μg total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-P-tyrosine (Cell Signaling #9411 1:100) overnight at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. Samples were purified using Protein A/G Plus Agarose beads (Roche) for 1 h at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. The immune complex was eluted with non-reducing sample buffer and boiled at 100°C for 5 min before being applied to a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred, and immunoblotted as described below.Immunoblotting C2C12 and primary myotubes were washed with ice-cold PBS before lysing in 100 to 200 μL of RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 15 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium hexahydral, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 0.025% sodium azide) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatants retained. EDL muscles were ground using a dry ice-cooled pestle and mortar, and lysed in 200 μL of RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h, vortexing half-way through, centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatants retained. Protein content was determined using a Bradford method protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates (30 μg total protein for myotube cultures, 90 μg total protein for EDL muscles) were separated by SDS-PAGE on Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TTBS (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween-20, pH 8), with 2% BSA added for some antibodies, then probed with antibodies to the following: phospho (P)-p70S6K (T389) (Cell Signaling #9205 1:200 for primary cultures, Cell Signaling #9234 1:250 for isolated muscles), P-p70S6K (T421/S424) (Cell Signaling #9204 1:1,000), P-S6RP (Cell Signaling #2211 1:2,000), P-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101 1:500), total (T)-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9107 1:1,000), P-Akt (Cell Signaling #9271 1:300), T-Akt (Cell Signaling #2920 1:2,000), P-FAK (Millipore 05-1140, 1:500), T-FAK (Millipore 06-543, 1:1,000), γ-SG (Novocastra VP-G803 1:300), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Santa Cruz sc-32233 1:5,000), and tubulin (Sigma T5168 1:20,000). Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant TL, 1D gel analysis (C2C12 and myotube cultures, rapamycin sensitivity experiments) or ImageJ () (all other isolated muscles). P-p70S6K and P-S6RP were normalized to either GAPDH or tubulin, P-FAK was normalized to either T-FAK or GAPDH, P-Akt was normalized to T-Akt, and P-ERK1/2 was normalized to T-ERK1/2.Microscopy Images of primary cultures were taken using a Leica DM RBE microscope and Leica DFC300 CCD camera, using OpenLab software (Perkin Elmer).Statistics Comparisons between non-stretched and stretched C2C12 cells (Figure 1) were done by unpaired T test. Comparisons between C57 and γ-SG-/- primary cultures across time (Figure 2) were done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Comparisons between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles in calcium experiments (Figure 3) were done by unpaired T test. Comparisons between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles with and without stretch for each time point (Figure 4) or with and without rapamycin (Figure 5) were done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

Therefore, we initially investigated mechanotransduction signaling in passively stretched C2C12 myotubes. We found that passive stretching in vitro did not alter phosphorylation of ERK1 or Akt and that ERK2 and FAK phosphorylation decreased following stretch (Figure 1A,C-F,H-I). However, we found an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation at T389, which reflects activity, in response to passive stretching of C2C12 myotubes (Figure 1B,G). Therefore, this in vitro model reflected some, but not all, stretch responses observed in muscle in vivo[43,44], and highlighted p70S6K as a pathway of interest. The lack of Akt phosphorylation suggests that p70S6K phosphorylation occurred through an Akt-independent pathway, while the lack of FAK phosphorylation supports an integrin-independent mechanism.Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in C57 and γ-SG-/- primary cultures Having established pathways of interest in vitro using the C2C12 cell line, we used primary myoblast cultures from C57 and γ-SG-/- mice (Figure 2A) to investigate the changes in mechanotransduction signaling associated solely with the loss of the SG complex in myofibers. C57 and γ-SG-/- cultures were stretched for 30 min as described above and lysates were harvested 1, 2, or 4 h after stretching ended, to allow observation of the signaling time course. Immunoblotting analysis showed that there was no difference in basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation between C57 and γ-SG-/- myotubes and little change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to stretch (Figure 2B,D,E). Therefore, similar to the C2C12 cells, primary cultures did not reflect the ERK1/2 phosphorylation responses found previously in C57 and γ-SG-/- mice in vivo[10,11]. Neither P-Akt nor P-FAK displayed significant differences between C57 and γ-SG-/- cultures (Figure 2B,F,G). Further, these proteins did not show any prolonged response to passive stretch in the primary cultures, consistent with the lack of an acute positive stretch response in C2C12 cells. Examination of p70S6K revealed a trend towards elevated T389 phosphorylation at baseline in γ-SG-/- myotubes, compared to C57 myotubes. Activation of p70S6K in γ-SG-/- myotubes upon stretch was not apparent (Figure 2B,C), but C57 myotubes displayed a trend for increased activation at 2 and 4 h after stretching (Figure 2B,C). Therefore, while the primary cultures reflect some of the responses found in C2C12 myotubes, the experimental system is too variable to draw firm conclusions regarding mechanical signaling pathways associated with γ-SG.Elevated P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles is calcium independent Our experiments in myotubes, together with our previous studies in isolated muscles [10,11], suggested that ERK1/2 phosphorylation changes require active contraction in addition to stretch, whereas p70S6K responds to stretch alone. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we extended our analysis to examine the response of p70S6K to passive stretch of isolated muscles. P-p70S6k was elevated approximately 1.7-fold in resting γ-SG-/- EDL muscles incubated in normal oxygenated Ringer’s solution (Figure 3C; Normal). As in our previous studies, there was a 3- and 1.5-fold increase of P-ERK1 and P-ERK2, respectively, in resting γ-SG-/- EDL muscles (Figure 3A-B; Normal). Because both of these pathways converge to phosphorylate S6RP, we compared the phosphorylation state of this protein in muscles from both genotypes. γ-SG-/- EDL muscles exhibited an 8-fold increase in P-S6RP, which was consistent with the higher basal phosphorylation state of the upstream pathways (Figure 3D; Normal). Heightened mechanosensitive signaling could arise through increased flux of ions across the sarcolemma, particularly Ca2+[17]. This could occur either through enhanced activity of channels, such as the TRP family of cation channels (reviewed in [28,29]), or via membrane ruptures. To determine the calcium dependence of the observed differences in p70S6K and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in γ-SG-/- muscles, we incubated muscles in calcium-free Ringers solution, retaining the same ionic strength. Absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter the relative difference in P-p70S6K between γ-SG-/- and C57 muscles (Figure 3C). However, the increased P-ERK1/2 and P-S6RP found in γ-SG-/- muscles in normal Ringer’s solution was abrogated when there was no calcium in the bathing solution (Figure 3A,B,D). Thus, only p70S6K phosphorylation appeared to be calcium independent. Because intracellular calcium stores can also alter the intracellular calcium concentration, particularly during muscle activation, tetracaine was used to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptors. Verification of this inhibition was established in a separate experiment, through measuring tetanic force generation by EDL muscles before and after addition of tetracaine. After 15 min incubation with tetracaine, force production was virtually eliminated (force was 297 mN prior to addition of tetracaine, 2.4 mN after 15 min incubation with tetracaine and not detectable after 20 min incubation with tetracaine). Again, relative P-p70S6K levels between the two muscle groups were not altered by tetracaine (Figure 3C). In contrast, blockade of SR Ca2+ release reduced P-ERK1 levels in γ-SG-/- muscles relative to C57 muscles, even though there was no alteration in P-ERK2 (Figure 3A,B). Phosphorylation of S6RP remained elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles in the presence of tetracaine, but to a lesser extent than in normal Ringer’s solution (Figure 3D). Taken together, both extracellular and intracellular calcium contribute to the heightened P-ERK1 levels in γ-SG-/- muscles, whereas the increase in basal P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles is not dependent on either extracellular or intracellular calcium.Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in isolated C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles Having established that P-p70S6K changes at rest did not depend on calcium, we pursued the role of p70S6K in γ-SG-dependent mechanotransduction in vivo. A passive stretching protocol comprised of a 15% strain, 20 times per min, for 30 min in high-glucose DMEM was sufficient to cause increased γ-SG phosphorylation in the EDL, as is the case for eccentric contraction of the EDL (Figure 4A; [10]). We stretched C57 and γ-SG-/- EDL muscles for either 30 or 90 min and immediately snap-froze them in liquid nitrogen. We then used immunoblotting to measure phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389, as above, and also at T421/S424 in the auto-inhibitory domain. Basal phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 showed a trend to be increased in unstretched γ-SG-/- muscles compared to C57 muscles (Figure 4B,C). However, basal phosphorylation at T421/S424 was not different between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles (Figure 4D). After 30 min of stretch, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 and T421/S424 was increased to a similar degree in stretched C57 and γ-SG-/- EDL muscles, compared to non-stretched controls. However, after 90 min of stretch, phosphorylation at T389 and T421/S424 had decreased in stretched C57 muscles and was close to non-stretched levels. In contrast, phosphorylation at T389 was further increased, and T421/S424 phosphorylation remained elevated, in stretched γ-SG-/- muscles, compared to non-stretched controls (Figure 4B-D). For T389 phosphorylation after 90 min of stretch, genotype, stretch, and the interaction between them were all statistically significant, by two-way ANOVA. T421/S424 showed a similar trend to T389; however, while the effect of stretch was statistically significant, the difference between genotypes was not. Thus, in contrast to primary cultures, γ-SG-/- muscles exhibited heightened and prolonged activation of p70S6K in response to passive stretch, implying that γ-SG plays a role in p70S6K inactivation.Stretch response of p70S6K T389, but not S6RP, is rapamycin-sensitive in γ-SG-/- muscles Because mTOR is a key mediator of p70S6K activation, we examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on stretch responses in isolated C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. EDL muscles were subjected to cyclic stretch for 90 min, as described above. Unlike in C2C12 cells and primary cultures, P-Akt showed a trend to increase on stretching, which was statistically significant in γ-SG-/- muscles. As anticipated, P-Akt was unaffected by rapamycin (Figure 5A,B). Rapamycin treatment completely blocked the increase in p70S6K T389 phosphorylation after passive stretch of C57 muscles, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. In γ-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin abrogated most p70S6K T389 phosphorylation, but residual phosphorylation remained in stretched muscles (Figure 5A,C). T421/S424 showed a trend to increase in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. Surprisingly, rapamycin blunted the p70S6K T421/S424 stretch response in C57 muscles, which is inconsistent with previous studies [36]. However, the T421/S424 response to stretch persisted in γ-SG-/- muscles in the presence of rapamycin (Figure 5A,D). S6RP phosphorylation increased in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles. Interestingly, while rapamycin blocked stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP in C57 muscles, phosphorylation in response to stretch was preserved in γ-SG-/- muscles (Figure 5A,E). Taken together, these results suggest either that the level of active p70S6K remaining in γ-SG-/- muscles is sufficient to phosphorylate S6RP regardless of rapamycin or that an alternate pathway bypasses p70S6K to phosphorylate S6RP in muscles lacking γ-SG.Discussion Skeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in workload. Almost all muscle properties can be modulated, such as muscle fiber size, contractile properties and metabolism. Changes in patterns of gene expression as well as shifts in the balance between protein synthesis and degradation are required to complete the adaptational response. Identification of major pathways that directly regulate gene expression and protein synthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs (mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge on final common pathways for muscle growth and adaptation (reviewed in [45]). However, sorting out the contribution of the wide variety of inputs on muscle adaptation has been more difficult. In our previous work, we used an eccentric contraction protocol to investigate the dependence of ERK1/2 mechano-sensing on phosphorylation of γ-SG. However, this protocol alters multiple factors, including externally applied tension, internally generated tension and changes in extracellular and intracellular calcium fluxes, all of which potentially have effects on mechanosensitive signaling pathways. In the present study, we used a passive stretching protocol to isolate the effects of externally applied tension in the absence of active contraction, in order to examine the downstream signaling in more detail. Passive stretching protocols can be performed in both cell cultures and whole muscle preparations, and the reductionist approach of utilizing cultures can eliminate some of the physiological complexities associated with intact or isolated muscles. As such, our initial experiments using C2C12 cells were key to identifying p70S6K as being activated in response to stretch, in contrast to the lack of response by ERK1/2, Akt, or FAK. Primary myotubes generated from C57 or γ-SG-/- mice had the distinct advantage of efficient germline elimination of γ-SG combined with an in vitro culture system. Even though these experiments displayed trends towards differential activation of p70S6K after stretch, the inherent variability of the preparation impaired identification of signaling patterns that were dependent upon either stretch or γ-SG. Thus, we returned to isolated muscles from C57 and γ-SG-/- mice to investigate γ-SG-dependent mechanotransduction pathways. Using this model, we observed a modest increase of P-p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscles at rest that was independent of intra- or extracellular calcium, and a prolonged activation of p70S6K following stretch. These results support a role for γ-SG in particular, or the SG complex in general, in mechanical signal transduction, where the loss of this protein leads to an increase in activation, and deficit in deactivation, or a combination of both. Given the dependence of our findings on the experimental platform utilized, future directions will include verification of the results in an even more intact system, such as in situ muscle preparations or whole animals. An intriguing explanation for our in vivo results is that γ-SG is required for dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K. There is considerable evidence that p70S6K is directly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), independently of mTOR [46-49]. The phosphatase PHLPP has also been shown to target p70S6K [50]. γ-SG may mediate the activation of these phosphatases in response to sustained mechanical stimulation. Alternatively, γ-SG may regulate pathways that deactivate p70S6K indirectly. For example, the phosphatase SHP-2 can cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K [51,52]. Further studies will be required to define the inactivation pathway disrupted by γ-SG loss. Passive stretch eliminates the contribution of active contraction or SR calcium fluxes, but does not eliminate the effects of extracellular Ca2+ fluxes through mechanically sensitive channels. Further, as previously shown, passive stretch causes greater Ca2+ influx into myotubes lacking members of the SG complex [17], raising the possibility that the mechanical signal transduction pathways we evaluated previously may be modulated not only by the SG complex, but also by additional channels in the sarcolemma. To address this, we examined the contribution of calcium to the elevated p70S6K and ERK1/2 activity found in γ-SG-/- muscles. We found that the elevation of P-ERK1/2 in the absence of γ-SG was dependent on both internal and external sources of calcium. In contrast, the difference in basal P-p70S6K between C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles was not calcium dependent. This suggests that while ERK1/2 activation may lie downstream of the calcium misregulation that occurs in SG-deficient muscle, changes in p70S6K activation may be a more direct consequence of the absence of the SG complex. This is of great interest given that γ-SG has been shown to be important for mechanotransduction, but the downstream signaling pathways are uncharacterized [10,11]. Furthermore, p70S6K has been implicated in mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle, but the upstream initiation signals are not known [36,53-55]. However, it should be noted that SG-deficient muscle undergoes substantial degeneration and subsequent regeneration, which may also explain the elevated basal p70S6K, which is transiently increased during regeneration [56]. Our study found that the pattern of differential p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch in γ-SG-/- muscles was similar both for phosphorylation of T389, which correlates with kinase activity, and for T421/S424, two of the four phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain. Phosphorylation of T389 is mTOR-dependent, while phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is carried out by proline-directed kinases. Furthermore, it is thought that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is necessary for phosphorylation of T389 [37]. The correlation between phosphorylation of T421/S424 and T389 in our isolated muscle model therefore suggests that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain was the rate-limiting step for p70S6K activation, an intriguing prospect given that the autoinhibitory domain may be targeted by ERK1/2 [57]. Therefore, a future hypothesis to test is that differential p70S6K activation is a downstream consequence of differential ERK1/2 activation in γ-SG-/- muscle. This would implicate Ca2+ as an indirect modulator of p70S6K activity, since the increase in P-ERK1/2 in γ-SG-/- muscle is dependent upon heightened Ca2+ flux. It is worth noting that recent work by others has shown that stretch-induced activation of mTOR and p70S6K at T389 is independent of ERK1/2 [54], which can regulate mTOR via tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 and Raptor [58-60]. However, this pathway is separate from the putative direct phosphorylation of the p70S6K T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites by ERK1/2. Our experiments with rapamycin showed that, for both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mTOR-dependent, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. The T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites were phosphorylated in response to stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- muscles, which was different to our initial experiment in stretched isolated muscles, where the C57 response had diminished by 90 min of stretching. However, in the presence of rapamycin, this response was not present. This is surprising given that the T421/S424 sites are not thought to be targeted by mTOR. Previous studies have shown these sites to be rapamycin-insensitive [36], but recent evidence suggests a modest mTOR dependence [61]. In γ-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin had no effect on T421/S424 phosphorylation. Further experiments are needed to fully understand the role of mTOR on phosphorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain in C57 and γ-SG-/- skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP was rapamycin sensitive in C57 muscles, but not in γ-SG-/- muscles. This suggests that an alternative pathway can bring about S6RP phosphorylation in γ-SG-/- muscles when p70S6K is not activated. One possibility is that S6RP is phosphorylated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which is activated by ERK; this is consistent with the increase in basal ERK1/2 in γ-SG-/- muscles, and the over-response of ERK2 on mechanical stimulation by eccentric contraction [10]. We did not observe a strong Akt response to passive stretch, or any difference between C57 and γSG-/-, implying that mTOR and/or p70S6K were being activated through Akt-independent pathways. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Akt does not respond to mechanical stimulation in skeletal muscle, and that p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch is independent of PI3K [62]. We also did not see increased phosphorylation of FAK in response to passive stretch in C2C12 cells or primary myotubes. Although integrins can participate in mechanotransduction, it appears that our cyclic passive stretch protocols did not cause integrin activation. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and integrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the role of calcium in these signaling cascades.Based on our findings, we position γSG as a mechanosensor, schematized in Figure 6, that is important for transient ERK1/2 activation during active contractions, as well as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive stretch. Because passive stretch does not appear to increase P-FAK or P-Akt, γSG is likely to regulate p70S6K through other pathways. These may include regulation of ERK1/2, which can promote p70S6K activation indirectly via mTOR or directly by phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain, and/or phosphatases such as PP2A that dephosphorylate p70S6K. Loss of γSG uncouples the response to stretch, which may contribute to muscle pathology. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Relevant signaling pathways and relationship to γ-SG. Schematic of signaling pathways measured or discussed in this manuscript. Dotted lines indicate possible relationships to γ-SG. Arrowheads indicate an activating relationship, while blunt ends indicate a repressing relationship. Dashed line indicates priming, rather than full activation.The stability of the SG complex is directly affected in several LGMDs and in DMD, and a significant part of the pathology in these diseases appears to be inappropriate load sensing. The first step in therapeutic development is identifying and understanding the target, but little is currently known about the role of the SG complex in load sensing. Therefore, understanding the functions that are disrupted and the pathways that are involved in mechanotransduction involving the SG complex will help in the design of therapies for LGMDs and DMD. While restoration of a completely normal SG complex either through gene correction or protein replacement would also normalize mechanical signal transduction, this may not be possible for all mutations responsible for DMD and LGMD. It is known that localization of the SG complex is not the sole criterion for appropriate signaling [11]. Hence, other proteins may be necessary to correct signaling even when the complex is restored, and downstream pathways may emerge as more feasible therapeutic targets. We do not know whether the enhanced basal and stretch-responsive activation of p70S6K in γ-SG-/- muscle contributes to pathology or compensates for it. Likewise, it is not clear whether inhibition of p70S6K would have a beneficial or a detrimental effect in dystrophic muscle. Muscle specific gene targeting of mTORC1 components induces myopathy [63,64] and overexpression of integrin α7 can improve the dystrophic phenotype through increased survival signaling via p70S6K [65], suggesting that p70S6K inhibition would not be advantageous. However, treatment of mdx mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin improves the dystrophic phenotype [66]. It is also interesting to note that p70S6K is inhibited by glucocorticoids, which are used in the treatment of DMD and LGMD [67]. Our results begin to provide mechanistic insight into how mechanical signaling is disrupted and altered in the absence of γ-SG. In addition to increasing our understanding of the normal function of the SG complex, there is potential to provide more refined targets that could be beneficial to patients either in isolation or in combination with other therapeutic approaches.Conclusions We have identified p70S6K as part of a novel SG-dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that γ-SG is required for the inactivation of p70S6K following its activation in response to mechanical stimulation. These studies provide new insights into the normal function of the SG complex, and the mechanisms by which its deficiency in some forms of muscular dystrophy may contribute to pathology.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions CM carried out the calcium dependence experiments and the stretching experiments in isolated muscles, and drafted the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized.Results Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.Conclusions These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.",

Seeds were sown in Sunshine Soil mix, incubated at 4°C for 2 to 3 days, then grown at 22°C, 70% relative humidity, in a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod [26]. Screening for T-DNA insertion mutants T-DNA insertion mutants of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c (Salk_045030 (AtrabD2b-1), Salk_117532 (AtrabD2b-2) and Salk_120116 (AtrabD2b-3) for AtrabD2b; Salk_054626 (AtrabD2c-3) for AtrabD2c) were obtained from ABRC [38]. Homozygous lines for T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR genotyping. For each T-DNA insertion mutant, two sets of PCRs were performed using genomic DNA as a template: one with a gene-specific primer and a T-DNA left border primer LBb1, the second with two gene-specific primers. The PCR products were sequenced to confirm the locations of the T-DNA insertion sites for all of the mutants. The gene specific primers used are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 20 DAI (days after imbibition) plants using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,) as per the manufacturer's manual. The β-tubulin gene, which is highly conserved and constitutively expressed in all eukaryotes, was used as a standard. The primers used are listed in Table 2. The RT-PCR products were sequenced to confirm the correct amplification product. In vitro pollen germination and growth measurement Pollen was obtained from flowers collected from Arabidopsis plants (ten plant lines per genotype) 1 to 2 weeks after bolting. Pollen from AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type plants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18% (w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) boric acid, 1mM MgSO4, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ca(NO3)2, and 0.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.0 [39] overnight at room temperature and examined and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan II compound microscope equipped with an AxioCam color digital camera. Measurements were performed using SIS Pro software (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the original image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200 pollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype, and significance was assessed using Student's t-test. For fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen was transferred onto a slide and two drops of aniline blue solution (0.005% aniline blue solution in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were added for ten minutes. To confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open flowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and inserted vertically into germination medium in a 9-cm Petri dish. Plates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22°C at 100% humidity under continuous illumination. The paths of pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing whole pistils in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer and stained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was then cleared for 24 hours at room temperature with a drop of clearing solution (240 g of chloral hydrate and 30 g of glycerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 light microscope (LM) and images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss,Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision 4.3 software. The microscope was equipped with a DAPI filter set comprising an excitation filter (BP 365/12 nm), a beam splitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). The objectives used for imaging were a Neofluar 40× oil, an Apochromat 63× oil, and a Neofluar 100× oil. Cloning Promoter::GFP/GUS fusion constructs were made for each gene by cloning the amplified promoter region (intergenic region; 964 bp for AtRabD2b and 558 bp for AtRabD2c) into the binary vector pBGWFS7 (GATEWAY; Invitrogen). The genomic fragments containing AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c with their respective promoters for complementation of the mutant phenotype were amplified using AtRabD2b-g-F and R or AtRabD2c-g-F and R primers (Table 2). Products were cloned into the pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen), and then were transferred into the pMDC123 binary vector for plant transformation. Plant transformation and selection Arabidopsis plants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens by the floral dip method [40] and selected for Basta resistance conferred by the T-DNA. Transcriptomic analysis MetaOmGraph (MOG; http://www.metnetdb.org) [25] was used to analyze expression patterns of AtRabD1, AtRabD2a, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c and derive the correlation between them. GUS assay Transgenic T2 seedlings were germinated in soil and harvested at various stages of development. Plants or organs were stained at room temperature overnight as described [41], then destained in 70% (v/v) ethanol. For each construct, at least 7 independently transformed lines, 7 plants for each stage, were harvested for GUS screening. Transient expression in protoplasts Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts was carried out as described previously [42]. In brief, Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of 3-4 week old plants. Leaf strips were digested in a buffer containing cellulose R-10 and macerozyme R-10. After adding 30 μg of plasmid DNA, an equal volume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40% (w/v) PEG4000, 25% (v/v) 0.8M mannitol, 10% 1M CaCl2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in the dark at room temperature overnight and then viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described below. Confocal laser scanning microscopy Colocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with ST-YFP was performed using a Leica TCS SP10 confocal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emission bandwidths to minimize bleed-through. Transformed cells were excited with a 488 nm laser (power 20%) and 514 nm laser (50% power), and GFP and YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and 560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformed cells and cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion were used as controls to confirm the absence of cross talk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals. Scanning electron microscopy Pollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 5 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h and washed two times in the same buffer, followed by deionized water. Samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%; 30 min per step), followed by two changes of ultrapure 100% ethanol, all 30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined without fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in a DCP-1 Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http://www.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide, and mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided sticky pads and silver cement. Samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold (20%) and palladium (80%) in a Denton Vacuum LLC Desk II Cold Sputter Unit (http://www.dentonvacuum.com), and viewed with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (http://www.jeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollen grains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coated with gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally collected images including the LM and SEM images were processed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and made into plates using Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each plant line were used for SEM or LM analysis.",
    "results": "Results The expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are closely correlated The four RabD family members in Arabidopsis share about 88% identity at the amino acid level. The accumulation pattern of the associated transcripts is quite distinct across a wide variety of experimental conditions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http://www.metnetdb.org/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm;[26]) (Table 1; Additional file 1, Table S1). AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at a Pearson correlation value of 0.72), whereas AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the others (Pearson correlation value of < 0.20). Based on their high sequence similarity (99% amino acid identity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumulation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that is not shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a. Table 1. Pearson correlation between expression patterns of AtRabD family members. AtRabD1 AtRabD2a AtRabD2b AtRabD2c AtRabD1 100% AtRabD2a 17.08% 100% AtRabD2b -3.4% 22.19% 100% AtRabD2c 15.92% 25.23% 77.81% 100% Open in a new tab Identification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c It was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutant has no phenotype [22]. Based on our correlation analysis above, we hypothesized that this mutant may have some more subtle defects that cannot be compensated for by the remaining family members. To investigate this further, we identified T-DNA insertion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b (3 alleles) and AtrabD2c (1 allele). Homozygous lines for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR, using primers selected by iSct primers (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html), and the insertion sites were determined by sequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis of mRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 are null mutants. However, the AtrabD2b-3 mutation had no effect on AtRabD2b RNA accumulation (Figure 1C and data not shown). Progeny from AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 heterozygotes showed a T-DNA segregation ratio of approximately 3:1 based on kanamycin resistance, consistent with a single insertion. AtrabD2b-2 was supplied as a homozygous line. To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutants, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 homozygous single mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed to self fertilize and the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant was identified from the F2 population by PCR using the primers for both AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1. Hereafter, the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant will be referred to as AtrabD2b/2c, and AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 single mutants will be referred to as AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively.

B, Genotypes of T-DNA insertion mutants. Genomic DNA was isolated from the indicated single and double mutants and amplified by PCR. Primer pairs used were as following: lane 1, AtrabD2c-LP1 and AtrabD2c-RP1; lane 2, AtrabD2c-RP1 and LBb1; lane 3, AtrabD2b-LP1 and AtrabD2b-RP1; lane 4, AtrabD2b-RP1 and LBb1. C, Analysis of transcripts from AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2c-1 and AtrabD2b/2c mutants. Total RNA from leaves of wild-type plants, AtrabD2c-1, AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2b/2c was amplified by RT-PCR. Primer pairs for AtRabD2c were AtRabD2c-F and AtRabD2c-R, primer pairs for AtRabD2b were AtRabD2b-F and AtRabD2b-R. Tubulin was used as control. Siliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b/2c Double Mutant than in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines To evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three alleles, AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2b-3), AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants, along with wild-type siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without various hormone, nutrient and light treatments. We tested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantlet website (http://www.gantlet.org); however, no significant phenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings for any of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition, we tested the seedling phenotype on media with or without sucrose or vitamin B5 and, consistent with previous reports [22], no obvious phenotypes were observed. By contrast, AtrabD2b/2c double mutant lines showed a phenotype associated with reproduction. In these lines, siliques were shorter when grown either under continuous light or long day (16h light/8h dark) conditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c single mutant alleles displayed a short silique phenotype. The length of AtrabD2b/2c siliques was 70% of that of wild-type, AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutant lines (Figure 2; P < 0.01 by Student's t-test). To evaluate whether this reduced silique size is associated with a seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b/2c, wild-type, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at 10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defects in the seeds of either AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants were observed. However, approximately half of the ovules in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were not fertilized (Figure 3). Consistent with this observation, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants produced a smaller quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or single mutants (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Figure S1). These results are consistent with a functional overlap between AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be fulfilled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a. Figure 2.

Complementation of AtrabD2b/2c Mutant Phenotype To demonstrate that the AtrabD2b/2c mutant phenotype is due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c, each expressed from their native promoter, were introduced into the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. Both constructs were able to rescue the silique length phenotype of the mutant (Figure 4A, C) and restored the seed fertilization defect (Figure 4B) and seed number (Additional file 2, Figure S1), confirming that the loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c is responsible for these phenotypes. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Complementation of the double mutant phenotype. A, Siliques are shown from wild-type plants, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant and the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant complemented with either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c.

AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c Pollen Have Defects in Morphology and Pollen Tube Elongation Two possibilities could explain the unfertilized embryos seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. One possibility is that the pollen bears a defect that leads to pollen sterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alternatively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their fertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we observed the pollen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wild-type plants looked normal, whereas more than 20% of the AtrabD2b/2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed morphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that some abnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI staining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B) and single mutant plants (data not shown) have nuclei. This defective pollen may be the severely collapsed pollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce aberrant pollen at a level of about 10%. This is unexpected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities similar to the wild-type plants. A likely explanation is that there are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single mutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Pollen defects in AtrabD2b, AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/D2c mutants. A, Fresh pollen was examined by SEM. B, DAPI staining of pollen. Fresh pollen grains were stained with DAPI and photographed under the fluorescence microscope. Arrow indicates a pollen grain from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant that lacks a nucleus. C, IKI staining of pollen, demonstrating reduced staining of the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant pollen compared with wild-type pollen. Scale bars = 10 μm (A); 50 μm (B,C).We originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c because the transcript accumulation patterns of these two genes correlate with those of many genes associated with starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wild-type pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting a decreased starch content in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen. This is consistent with the expression correlation, although the reason for this phenotype is unclear. A single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of pollen grains, but usually there are less than 100 embryos in one silique. If only 20% of the pollen grains are abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly reduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations for the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and tube growth of the pollen grains, pollen was germinated in vitro. After overnight incubation, almost all of the pollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed a typical tip growth. However, about 10% of the pollen from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant did not germinate at all and 50% of the pollen germinated but did not grow apically as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and 6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and had swollen tips, some burst (≈5%), and others branched (≈2%; Figure 6A,B and 6D). The germination rate of the pollen from the single mutants was similar to the wild-type pollen. However, approximately 20% of the germinating pollen also had swollen tips (Figure 6A and 6B), although the phenotype was not as severe as the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes were never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6A and 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were much shorter than those of wild-type plants or either single mutant (P < 0.01), and the single mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-type plants (Figure 6E; P < 0.01 for both mutants). Even though the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had collapsed pollen, shorter pollen tubes and swollen tips, their siliques were normal compared with wild-type plants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may still have sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos to be fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes were confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in vivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wild-type or AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants were incubated overnight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b/2c mutant flowers had reduced pollen germination and decreased pollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growth may also be defective in vivo.

Scale bars = 10 μm (A); 50 μm (B, C); 20 μm (D). Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c Mutant To investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to the observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovary also has defects that might contribute to the reduced rate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is borne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pollen should rescue the AtrabD2b/2c mutant silique phenotype to a normal length (AtrabD2b/2c mutant female flower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plant pollen crossed with a wild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype of decreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossed with AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the ovary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollen would not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, and AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen would not mimic the mutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicated that pollen from wild-type plants can rescue the AtrabD2b/2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen from AtrabD2b/2c can bestow the shorter silique phenotype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifically, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in the siliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilized by AtrabD2b/2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the siliques from AtrabD2b/2c usually had about 50% unfertilized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized by wild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the siliques were longer than those siliques in the same inflorescence which were self-fertilized (Figures 7). These results confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly, if not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Wild-type pollen can restore the shorter siliques of the AtrabD2b/2c mutant to normal length.

Error bars indicate standard deviation. Scale bars= 850 μm (A); 500 μm (B). In silico and GUS Analysis of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c Expression If AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are involved in pollen development and pollen tube growth, they are expected to be co-expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. Public microarray data indicates that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are expressed throughout development, including high expression in floral organs and particularly in the stamen (Figure 8; [25,26]). Figure 8. Open in a new tab In silico expression analysis of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. The spatial and temporal expression profiles of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c were analyzed using Genevestigator anatomy (A) and development (B) tools, respectively. Numbers along the X axis represent the developmental stage: 1, germinated seed; 2, seedlings; 3, young rosette; 4, developed rosette; 5, bolting; 6, young flower; 7, developed flower; 8, flowers and siliques; 9, mature siliques.To directly examine the spatial expression pattern of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, transgenic lines containing promoter:GFP/GUS constructs for each gene were analyzed for GUS activity at various stages of development from germination to senescence. As indicated by the in silico analyses, both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c were expressed widely during development. GUS staining further indicated that in cotyledons, rosette leaves and cauline leaves, AtRabD2b expression was localized predominantly in vascular tissues (Figure 9B), whereas AtRabD2c was expressed ubiquitously in cotyledons and in mature leaves throughout the entire leaf. Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c was only expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was not expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers, AtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma, while AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigma and style (Figure 9E, F). This dichotomy of expression suggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may function independently of each other in certain cells. Both genes were expressed in pollen grains and germinating pollen (Figure 9E, F), which is consistent with their role in pollen development and pollen tube growth. They both also showed expression in roots, but AtRabD2b was ubiquitously expressed throughout the root, while AtRabD2c expression was excluded from root hairs and root tips (Figure 9A-D). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Temporal and spatial expression pattern of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Transgenic plants were generated that express the GUS gene driven by a 954bp or 558bp fragment upstream of the AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c start codon, respectively. GUS activity (blue color) was analyzed in cotyledons, young leaves, (A, B), old leaves, roots (C, D), flowers, pistils and germinated pollen (E, F). Subcellular localization of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c In mammals, different AtRabD orthologs (Rab1 isoforms) are localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or Golgi compartments. In plants, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b are associated with the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network [15,22,23,27], and we predicted that AtRabD2c will share this localization. To determine the subcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal was observed by confocal microscopy. For both constructs, GFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfected into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP [15], and YFP and GFP signals were observed. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure 10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consistent with a role in Golgi trafficking. Occasionally, AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seen that did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the post-Golgi compartments described previously [22,23,27]. Cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion demonstrated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFP signals (Additional file 3, Figure S2). Figure 10. Open in a new tab AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b or GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10 transformed protoplasts were observed for each construct.

    "discussion": "Discussion Rab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materials through the endomembrane system, controlling exocytosis of proteins and cell wall materials, endocytosis of receptors and transporters, and membrane recycling processes. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote specificity of vesicle transport to target compartments, ensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate target and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual organelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs) and Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to function in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi in mammalian cells [21,28-34]. The plant Rab1 and Rab2 homologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have also been reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport [15,16]. Here, we demonstrate a distinct physiological role for the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen development and pollen tube growth. Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http://www.metnetdb.org) [25,26] to determine the pairwise Pearsons correlation value between the expression patterns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1, Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only the expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated. From this data, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant functions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabD family members. To test our hypothesis, we used T-DNA insertion single and double mutants to confirm that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlap and show that they are both required for normal pollen development and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also showed that they both co-localize with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in Golgi trafficking. The conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are partially functionally redundant is based on several lines of evidence. First, although single mutant plants containing AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c mutant alleles are indistinguishable morphologically from their wild-type counterparts, even when grown under a variety of growth conditions, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant has a short-silique phenotype. Second, both AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant plants produce a small percentage of deformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b/2c lines produce a higher percentage of deformed pollen grains, many of which are severely deformed, some lacking nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen would give rise to defects in pollen germination, and indeed, though the germination rate is similar between AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type plants, about 10% of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b/2c double mutant plants are unable to geminate. Furthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen tubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen tubes and tend to have swollen tips and a shorter length; this phenotype is substantially more severe in AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen tubes from AtrabD2b/2c double mutants branch or burst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-type plants or either single mutant. These data also indicate that the loss of function of the AtRabD2b/2c genes cannot be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a genes, suggesting that either some function(s) of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from those of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are not expressed in the same cell types. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c co-localize with the Golgi marker ST-YFP upon transient expression in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also for AtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) [15]. It is therefore possible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesicle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as does AtRabD2a [15,22]. Complete disruption of Rab function in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to be lethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cell wall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants, except for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen tube defects. There are several possible explanations for this. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function in vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates are AtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate for the loss of function in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant in most cell types [22]. Moreover, other Rab families, such as tobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to be regulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus [16]. AtRabBs (AtRab2s) may have the same function, such that they also participate in ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA accumulation is most highly correlated with that of AtRabD2b (67%) and AtRabD2c (68%) (Additional file 1, Table S1). These genes might compensate in part for the loss of function of AtrabD2b/2c. Second, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with many other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tip growth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to the most proximal region of the tube, and growth is restricted to the tube apex [35]. In vitro, lily pollen tubes grow at about 150 nm/sec [35] and Arabidopsis pollen tubes at 37 nm/sec [36]; in vivo, tobacco pollen can grow at 42 nm/sec [37]. This fast growth is contingent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amounts of membrane and cell wall components to the apical region of the tubes. This extensive trafficking requirement may preclude the remaining Rabs from completely compensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Third, computational analysis of public microarray data, together with studies of the expression pattern directed by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters, indicated that both are widely expressed in most organs and several cell types, with high expression in pollen. Root hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and, like pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth. However, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in multiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this process may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to optimally support the large secretory requirement of these very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, these data indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate membrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth.",

Copyright notice ID: 3040128 PMID: 21269510 Abstract Background Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized.Results Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.Conclusions These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.Background Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate diverse processes in eukaryotic cells including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases are activated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequent hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as molecular switches in these processes [1,2]. The Rab GTPase family is the largest and most complex within the Ras protein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukaryotic cells [3-6]. Rab GTPase functions have been extensively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that different Rab proteins function in distinct intracellular membrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized to work together with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to promote specificity of vesicle transport to target compartments and facilitate vesicle and target membrane fusion [7-13]. They are therefore essential for the transport of proteins and membrane through the endomembrane system to their destination. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative Ras superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are Rab GTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the number in humans [13,14]. According to their sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mammalian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight subfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be further divided into 18 subclasses [13]. Relatively few of the plant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally. Most of these studies have used constitutively active (CA) and/or dominant negative (DN) mutations, generated by direct mutation of the conserved domain to restrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTP-bound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDP-bound form (dominant negative). Expression of CA or DN Rab GTPases can perturb the activity of the endogenous Rab, revealing their functional significance. For a number of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CA and DN mutants in transformed plants, together with protein localization information, has shown that these Rabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast and mammalian orthologs [15-19]. Several reports indicate that Rab proteins are important for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For example, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips of root hair cells and was proposed to regulate membrane trafficking through a compartment involved in the polarized secretion of cell wall components [18]. NtRab2 GTPase is important for trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen tubes and may be specialized to optimally support the high secretory demands in these tip growing cells [16]. NtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco is predominantly localized to an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip, and both constitutively active and dominant negative mutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meandering pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility [20]. There are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfamily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130, AtRab1b), AtRabD2b (At5g47200, AtRab1a) and AtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) [13]. In mammals, the orthologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associate with the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi and regulate membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi complex [21]. Fluorescent protein fusions with AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network [22,23], and transient expression in plant cells of dominant negative mutants of rabD2a or rabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking [15,22,24], suggesting a related function for the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. [22] isolated T-DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD family genes and reported that each of the single and double mutants lacked a detectable phenotype. By contrast, a rabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and a rabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth and low fertility, indicating that these gene family members perform important and overlapping functions. We previously hypothesized that closely related genes with a high Pearson correlation in their RNA accumulation level are functionally redundant, and showed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the process of starch synthesis [25], whereas the expression patterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We therefore predicted that these two Rab proteins may have redundant functions that are not shared by the other two AtRabD family members. Here we show that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in their RNA accumulation level across a variety of experimental conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockout mutants indicates that they are at least partially functionally redundant, and are important in pollen development and pollen tube growth. The proteins both localize to the trans-Golgi, consistent with their proposed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.Results The expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are closely correlated The four RabD family members in Arabidopsis share about 88% identity at the amino acid level. The accumulation pattern of the associated transcripts is quite distinct across a wide variety of experimental conditions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http://www.metnetdb.org/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm;[26]) (Table 1; Additional file 1, Table S1). AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at a Pearson correlation value of 0.72), whereas AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the others (Pearson correlation value of < 0.20). Based on their high sequence similarity (99% amino acid identity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumulation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that is not shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a. Table 1. Pearson correlation between expression patterns of AtRabD family members. AtRabD1 AtRabD2a AtRabD2b AtRabD2c AtRabD1 100% AtRabD2a 17.08% 100% AtRabD2b -3.4% 22.19% 100% AtRabD2c 15.92% 25.23% 77.81% 100% Open in a new tabIdentification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c It was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutant has no phenotype [22]. Based on our correlation analysis above, we hypothesized that this mutant may have some more subtle defects that cannot be compensated for by the remaining family members. To investigate this further, we identified T-DNA insertion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b (3 alleles) and AtrabD2c (1 allele). Homozygous lines for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR, using primers selected by iSct primers (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html), and the insertion sites were determined by sequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis of mRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 are null mutants. However, the AtrabD2b-3 mutation had no effect on AtRabD2b RNA accumulation (Figure 1C and data not shown). Progeny from AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 heterozygotes showed a T-DNA segregation ratio of approximately 3:1 based on kanamycin resistance, consistent with a single insertion. AtrabD2b-2 was supplied as a homozygous line. To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutants, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 homozygous single mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed to self fertilize and the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant was identified from the F2 population by PCR using the primers for both AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1. Hereafter, the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant will be referred to as AtrabD2b/2c, and AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 single mutants will be referred to as AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Characterization of AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutations. A, Gene map. The scaled linear map depicts the 8 exons as boxes and the 7 introns as lines between the boxes for both the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes. The positions of the translational start and stop codons in exon 1 and exon 8, respectively, are noted. The locations of the T-DNA insertions (not drawn to scale) in the genes are indicated. B, Genotypes of T-DNA insertion mutants. Genomic DNA was isolated from the indicated single and double mutants and amplified by PCR. Primer pairs used were as following: lane 1, AtrabD2c-LP1 and AtrabD2c-RP1; lane 2, AtrabD2c-RP1 and LBb1; lane 3, AtrabD2b-LP1 and AtrabD2b-RP1; lane 4, AtrabD2b-RP1 and LBb1. C, Analysis of transcripts from AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2c-1 and AtrabD2b/2c mutants. Total RNA from leaves of wild-type plants, AtrabD2c-1, AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2b/2c was amplified by RT-PCR. Primer pairs for AtRabD2c were AtRabD2c-F and AtRabD2c-R, primer pairs for AtRabD2b were AtRabD2b-F and AtRabD2b-R. Tubulin was used as control.Siliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b/2c Double Mutant than in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines To evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three alleles, AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2b-3), AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants, along with wild-type siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without various hormone, nutrient and light treatments. We tested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantlet website (http://www.gantlet.org); however, no significant phenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings for any of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition, we tested the seedling phenotype on media with or without sucrose or vitamin B5 and, consistent with previous reports [22], no obvious phenotypes were observed. By contrast, AtrabD2b/2c double mutant lines showed a phenotype associated with reproduction. In these lines, siliques were shorter when grown either under continuous light or long day (16h light/8h dark) conditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c single mutant alleles displayed a short silique phenotype. The length of AtrabD2b/2c siliques was 70% of that of wild-type, AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutant lines (Figure 2; P < 0.01 by Student's t-test). To evaluate whether this reduced silique size is associated with a seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b/2c, wild-type, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at 10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defects in the seeds of either AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants were observed. However, approximately half of the ovules in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were not fertilized (Figure 3). Consistent with this observation, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants produced a smaller quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or single mutants (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Figure S1). These results are consistent with a functional overlap between AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be fulfilled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a. Figure 2.

Scale bars = 200 μm.Complementation of AtrabD2b/2c Mutant Phenotype To demonstrate that the AtrabD2b/2c mutant phenotype is due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c, each expressed from their native promoter, were introduced into the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. Both constructs were able to rescue the silique length phenotype of the mutant (Figure 4A, C) and restored the seed fertilization defect (Figure 4B) and seed number (Additional file 2, Figure S1), confirming that the loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c is responsible for these phenotypes. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Complementation of the double mutant phenotype. A, Siliques are shown from wild-type plants, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant and the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant complemented with either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c.

C, Siliques (from 6 to 14 ) of the first inflorescence for the indicated genotypes were measured for each plant, with 10 plants measured for each genotype. Error bars indicate standard deviation. AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c Pollen Have Defects in Morphology and Pollen Tube Elongation Two possibilities could explain the unfertilized embryos seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. One possibility is that the pollen bears a defect that leads to pollen sterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alternatively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their fertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we observed the pollen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wild-type plants looked normal, whereas more than 20% of the AtrabD2b/2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed morphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that some abnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI staining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B) and single mutant plants (data not shown) have nuclei. This defective pollen may be the severely collapsed pollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce aberrant pollen at a level of about 10%. This is unexpected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities similar to the wild-type plants. A likely explanation is that there are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single mutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Pollen defects in AtrabD2b, AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/D2c mutants. A, Fresh pollen was examined by SEM. B, DAPI staining of pollen. Fresh pollen grains were stained with DAPI and photographed under the fluorescence microscope. Arrow indicates a pollen grain from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant that lacks a nucleus. C, IKI staining of pollen, demonstrating reduced staining of the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant pollen compared with wild-type pollen. Scale bars = 10 μm (A); 50 μm (B,C).We originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c because the transcript accumulation patterns of these two genes correlate with those of many genes associated with starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wild-type pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting a decreased starch content in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen. This is consistent with the expression correlation, although the reason for this phenotype is unclear. A single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of pollen grains, but usually there are less than 100 embryos in one silique. If only 20% of the pollen grains are abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly reduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations for the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and tube growth of the pollen grains, pollen was germinated in vitro. After overnight incubation, almost all of the pollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed a typical tip growth. However, about 10% of the pollen from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant did not germinate at all and 50% of the pollen germinated but did not grow apically as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and 6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and had swollen tips, some burst (≈5%), and others branched (≈2%; Figure 6A,B and 6D). The germination rate of the pollen from the single mutants was similar to the wild-type pollen. However, approximately 20% of the germinating pollen also had swollen tips (Figure 6A and 6B), although the phenotype was not as severe as the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes were never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6A and 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were much shorter than those of wild-type plants or either single mutant (P < 0.01), and the single mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-type plants (Figure 6E; P < 0.01 for both mutants). Even though the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had collapsed pollen, shorter pollen tubes and swollen tips, their siliques were normal compared with wild-type plants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may still have sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos to be fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes were confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in vivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wild-type or AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants were incubated overnight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b/2c mutant flowers had reduced pollen germination and decreased pollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growth may also be defective in vivo. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pollen tube elongation defects in AtrabD2b, AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants. A, Pollen was germinated in vitro for 6 hours and examined by SEM.

Pollen was germinated in vitro and pollen tube length measured after an overnight incubation using SIS Pro software (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) (n > 200). Error bars indicate standard deviation. Scale bars = 10 μm (A); 50 μm (B, C); 20 μm (D).Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c Mutant To investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to the observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovary also has defects that might contribute to the reduced rate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is borne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pollen should rescue the AtrabD2b/2c mutant silique phenotype to a normal length (AtrabD2b/2c mutant female flower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plant pollen crossed with a wild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype of decreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossed with AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the ovary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollen would not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, and AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen would not mimic the mutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicated that pollen from wild-type plants can rescue the AtrabD2b/2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen from AtrabD2b/2c can bestow the shorter silique phenotype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifically, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in the siliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilized by AtrabD2b/2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the siliques from AtrabD2b/2c usually had about 50% unfertilized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized by wild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the siliques were longer than those siliques in the same inflorescence which were self-fertilized (Figures 7). These results confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly, if not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Wild-type pollen can restore the shorter siliques of the AtrabD2b/2c mutant to normal length.

Error bars indicate standard deviation. Scale bars= 850 μm (A); 500 μm (B). In silico and GUS Analysis of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c Expression If AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are involved in pollen development and pollen tube growth, they are expected to be co-expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. Public microarray data indicates that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are expressed throughout development, including high expression in floral organs and particularly in the stamen (Figure 8; [25,26]). Figure 8. Open in a new tab In silico expression analysis of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. The spatial and temporal expression profiles of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c were analyzed using Genevestigator anatomy (A) and development (B) tools, respectively. Numbers along the X axis represent the developmental stage: 1, germinated seed; 2, seedlings; 3, young rosette; 4, developed rosette; 5, bolting; 6, young flower; 7, developed flower; 8, flowers and siliques; 9, mature siliques.To directly examine the spatial expression pattern of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, transgenic lines containing promoter:GFP/GUS constructs for each gene were analyzed for GUS activity at various stages of development from germination to senescence. As indicated by the in silico analyses, both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c were expressed widely during development. GUS staining further indicated that in cotyledons, rosette leaves and cauline leaves, AtRabD2b expression was localized predominantly in vascular tissues (Figure 9B), whereas AtRabD2c was expressed ubiquitously in cotyledons and in mature leaves throughout the entire leaf. Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c was only expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was not expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers, AtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma, while AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigma and style (Figure 9E, F). This dichotomy of expression suggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may function independently of each other in certain cells. Both genes were expressed in pollen grains and germinating pollen (Figure 9E, F), which is consistent with their role in pollen development and pollen tube growth. They both also showed expression in roots, but AtRabD2b was ubiquitously expressed throughout the root, while AtRabD2c expression was excluded from root hairs and root tips (Figure 9A-D). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Temporal and spatial expression pattern of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Transgenic plants were generated that express the GUS gene driven by a 954bp or 558bp fragment upstream of the AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c start codon, respectively. GUS activity (blue color) was analyzed in cotyledons, young leaves, (A, B), old leaves, roots (C, D), flowers, pistils and germinated pollen (E, F).Subcellular localization of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c In mammals, different AtRabD orthologs (Rab1 isoforms) are localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or Golgi compartments. In plants, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b are associated with the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network [15,22,23,27], and we predicted that AtRabD2c will share this localization. To determine the subcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal was observed by confocal microscopy. For both constructs, GFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfected into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP [15], and YFP and GFP signals were observed. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure 10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consistent with a role in Golgi trafficking. Occasionally, AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seen that did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the post-Golgi compartments described previously [22,23,27]. Cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion demonstrated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFP signals (Additional file 3, Figure S2). Figure 10. Open in a new tab AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b or GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10 transformed protoplasts were observed for each construct. Upper panel, GFP-AtRabD2b; lower panel, GFP-AtRabD2c. Scale bar = 10 μm.Discussion Rab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materials through the endomembrane system, controlling exocytosis of proteins and cell wall materials, endocytosis of receptors and transporters, and membrane recycling processes. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote specificity of vesicle transport to target compartments, ensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate target and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual organelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs) and Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to function in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi in mammalian cells [21,28-34]. The plant Rab1 and Rab2 homologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have also been reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport [15,16]. Here, we demonstrate a distinct physiological role for the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen development and pollen tube growth. Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http://www.metnetdb.org) [25,26] to determine the pairwise Pearsons correlation value between the expression patterns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1, Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only the expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated. From this data, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant functions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabD family members. To test our hypothesis, we used T-DNA insertion single and double mutants to confirm that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlap and show that they are both required for normal pollen development and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also showed that they both co-localize with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in Golgi trafficking. The conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are partially functionally redundant is based on several lines of evidence. First, although single mutant plants containing AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c mutant alleles are indistinguishable morphologically from their wild-type counterparts, even when grown under a variety of growth conditions, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant has a short-silique phenotype. Second, both AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant plants produce a small percentage of deformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b/2c lines produce a higher percentage of deformed pollen grains, many of which are severely deformed, some lacking nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen would give rise to defects in pollen germination, and indeed, though the germination rate is similar between AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type plants, about 10% of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b/2c double mutant plants are unable to geminate. Furthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen tubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen tubes and tend to have swollen tips and a shorter length; this phenotype is substantially more severe in AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen tubes from AtrabD2b/2c double mutants branch or burst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-type plants or either single mutant. These data also indicate that the loss of function of the AtRabD2b/2c genes cannot be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a genes, suggesting that either some function(s) of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from those of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are not expressed in the same cell types. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c co-localize with the Golgi marker ST-YFP upon transient expression in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also for AtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) [15]. It is therefore possible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesicle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as does AtRabD2a [15,22]. Complete disruption of Rab function in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to be lethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cell wall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants, except for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen tube defects. There are several possible explanations for this. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function in vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates are AtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate for the loss of function in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant in most cell types [22]. Moreover, other Rab families, such as tobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to be regulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus [16]. AtRabBs (AtRab2s) may have the same function, such that they also participate in ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA accumulation is most highly correlated with that of AtRabD2b (67%) and AtRabD2c (68%) (Additional file 1, Table S1). These genes might compensate in part for the loss of function of AtrabD2b/2c. Second, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with many other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tip growth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to the most proximal region of the tube, and growth is restricted to the tube apex [35]. In vitro, lily pollen tubes grow at about 150 nm/sec [35] and Arabidopsis pollen tubes at 37 nm/sec [36]; in vivo, tobacco pollen can grow at 42 nm/sec [37]. This fast growth is contingent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amounts of membrane and cell wall components to the apical region of the tubes. This extensive trafficking requirement may preclude the remaining Rabs from completely compensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Third, computational analysis of public microarray data, together with studies of the expression pattern directed by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters, indicated that both are widely expressed in most organs and several cell types, with high expression in pollen. Root hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and, like pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth. However, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in multiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this process may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to optimally support the large secretory requirement of these very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, these data indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate membrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth.Conclusions In summary, we used a T-DNA insertion mutant approach to demonstrate the function of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Our data indicated that both are Golgi residents; they have similar but not identical expression patterns, but are both highly expressed in pollen; they are both involved in tip growth of pollen tubes; and they are at least partially functionally redundant. Future work will focus on elucidating the molecular basis for the pollen phenotype in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.Methods Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia (Col-0), AtrabD2c-1, AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2b/2c (crosses of AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1) mutants in the same genetic background were used. Seeds were sown in Sunshine Soil mix, incubated at 4°C for 2 to 3 days, then grown at 22°C, 70% relative humidity, in a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod [26].Screening for T-DNA insertion mutants T-DNA insertion mutants of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c (Salk_045030 (AtrabD2b-1), Salk_117532 (AtrabD2b-2) and Salk_120116 (AtrabD2b-3) for AtrabD2b; Salk_054626 (AtrabD2c-3) for AtrabD2c) were obtained from ABRC [38]. Homozygous lines for T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR genotyping. For each T-DNA insertion mutant, two sets of PCRs were performed using genomic DNA as a template: one with a gene-specific primer and a T-DNA left border primer LBb1, the second with two gene-specific primers. The PCR products were sequenced to confirm the locations of the T-DNA insertion sites for all of the mutants. The gene specific primers used are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,) as per the manufacturer's manual. The β-tubulin gene, which is highly conserved and constitutively expressed in all eukaryotes, was used as a standard. The primers used are listed in Table 2. The RT-PCR products were sequenced to confirm the correct amplification product. In vitro pollen germination and growth measurement Pollen was obtained from flowers collected from Arabidopsis plants (ten plant lines per genotype) 1 to 2 weeks after bolting. Pollen from AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type plants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18% (w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) boric acid, 1mM MgSO4, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ca(NO3)2, and 0.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.0 [39] overnight at room temperature and examined and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan II compound microscope equipped with an AxioCam color digital camera. Measurements were performed using SIS Pro software (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the original image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200 pollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype, and significance was assessed using Student's t-test. For fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen was transferred onto a slide and two drops of aniline blue solution (0.005% aniline blue solution in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were added for ten minutes. To confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open flowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and inserted vertically into germination medium in a 9-cm Petri dish. Plates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22°C at 100% humidity under continuous illumination. The paths of pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing whole pistils in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer and stained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was then cleared for 24 hours at room temperature with a drop of clearing solution (240 g of chloral hydrate and 30 g of glycerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 light microscope (LM) and images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss,Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision 4.3 software. The microscope was equipped with a DAPI filter set comprising an excitation filter (BP 365/12 nm), a beam splitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). The objectives used for imaging were a Neofluar 40× oil, an Apochromat 63× oil, and a Neofluar 100× oil.Cloning Promoter::GFP/GUS fusion constructs were made for each gene by cloning the amplified promoter region (intergenic region; 964 bp for AtRabD2b and 558 bp for AtRabD2c) into the binary vector pBGWFS7 (GATEWAY; Invitrogen). The genomic fragments containing AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c with their respective promoters for complementation of the mutant phenotype were amplified using AtRabD2b-g-F and R or AtRabD2c-g-F and R primers (Table 2). Products were cloned into the pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen), and then were transferred into the pMDC123 binary vector for plant transformation.Plant transformation and selection Arabidopsis plants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens by the floral dip method [40] and selected for Basta resistance conferred by the T-DNA.Transcriptomic analysis MetaOmGraph (MOG; http://www.metnetdb.org) [25] was used to analyze expression patterns of AtRabD1, AtRabD2a, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c and derive the correlation between them.GUS assay Transgenic T2 seedlings were germinated in soil and harvested at various stages of development. Plants or organs were stained at room temperature overnight as described [41], then destained in 70% (v/v) ethanol. For each construct, at least 7 independently transformed lines, 7 plants for each stage, were harvested for GUS screening.Transient expression in protoplasts Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts was carried out as described previously [42]. In brief, Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of 3-4 week old plants. Leaf strips were digested in a buffer containing cellulose R-10 and macerozyme R-10. After adding 30 μg of plasmid DNA, an equal volume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40% (w/v) PEG4000, 25% (v/v) 0.8M mannitol, 10% 1M CaCl2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in the dark at room temperature overnight and then viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described below.Confocal laser scanning microscopy Colocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with ST-YFP was performed using a Leica TCS SP10 confocal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emission bandwidths to minimize bleed-through. Transformed cells were excited with a 488 nm laser (power 20%) and 514 nm laser (50% power), and GFP and YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and 560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformed cells and cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion were used as controls to confirm the absence of cross talk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals.Scanning electron microscopy Pollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 5 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h and washed two times in the same buffer, followed by deionized water. Samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%; 30 min per step), followed by two changes of ultrapure 100% ethanol, all 30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined without fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in a DCP-1 Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http://www.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide, and mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided sticky pads and silver cement. Samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold (20%) and palladium (80%) in a Denton Vacuum LLC Desk II Cold Sputter Unit (http://www.dentonvacuum.com), and viewed with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (http://www.jeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollen grains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coated with gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally collected images including the LM and SEM images were processed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and made into plates using Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each plant line were used for SEM or LM analysis.Authors' contributions JP carried out the experimental analyses described and drafted the manuscript.

These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity. The plant vacuole is a versatile organelle that has important functions, including maintaining turgor, ion homeostasis, compartmentalizing toxic material, accumulating defense compounds, and storing and degrading proteins (Marty, 1999). To maintain these functions, correct transport of vacuolar proteins is required. Vacuolar proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported cotranslationally into the ER lumen. From the ER, they are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via the Golgi (Törmäkangas et al., 2001). In the TGN, vacuolar proteins with sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinants are thought to be recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs; Kirsch et al., 1994; Ahmed et al., 2000; daSilva et al., 2005), although a recent report has suggested that recognition of cargo by VSRs may occur as early as the ER (Niemes et al., 2010). Storage proteins with C-terminal sorting sequences are also bound by VSRs or by a second putative sorting receptor, RMR1 (Jiang et al., 2000; Shimada et al., 2003a; Park et al., 2005, 2007; Hinz et al., 2007). After the receptors recognize their cargo, vacuolar proteins are transported to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC; Sanderfoot et al., 1998; Happel et al., 2004; Song et al., 2006) before transport on to the vacuole. In mammalian cells, cargo receptors are recycled from their destination to the site of cargo binding (Seaman, 2005). VSR1 was found to localize to the TGN and the PVC (Paris et al., 1997; Sanderfoot et al., 1998); thus, VSR1 was also suggested to cycle between these organelles. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are integral membrane proteins required for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. SNAREs can be classified based on their site of function: v (vesicle)-SNAREs are localized to the vesicle membrane, and t (target)-SNAREs are localized to the target membrane (Rothman, 1994; Søgaard et al., 1994). Generally, one v-SNARE on the vesicle and three t-SNAREs on the target membrane form a trans-SNARE complex, bringing the two membranes in contact and driving membrane fusion (McNew et al., 2000). Clathrin-coated vesicles containing VSR1 contain the v-SNARE VTI11, which forms a SNARE complex with SYP5, SYP2, and VAMP727 at the PVC during anterograde trafficking from the TGN (Kirsch et al., 1994; Sanderfoot et al., 2001a; Ebine et al., 2008). However, the mechanism of recycling of VSR1 from the PVC to the TGN is not yet fully understood. A complex containing the SNAREs SYP41, SYP61, and VTI12 and the Sec1/Munc18-like protein AtVPS45, a potential regulator of vesicle fusion (Dulubova et al., 2002; Bryant and James, 2003), is found at the TGN in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Bassham and Raikhel, 1998; Bassham et al., 2000). SNAREs in the SYP41 complex, along with another SNARE, YKT61/62, were found to be sufficient for vesicle fusion in vitro (Chen et al., 2005). Recently, AtVPS45 was suggested to be involved in the recycling of VSR1, as RNA interference knockdown of AtVPS45 expression causes mislocalization of VSR1 (Zouhar et al., 2009). SYP41 and SYP42 are highly homologous t-SNAREs with 62% amino acid sequence identity. However, they form separate complexes with AtVPS45 in different subdomains of the TGN (Bassham et al., 2000) and are not functionally redundant, as individual syp41 and syp42 knockout mutants are gametophytic lethal (Sanderfoot et al., 2001b). A mutation in SYP61, another t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex (Zhu et al., 2002), caused defects in osmotic stress tolerance and abscisic acid regulation of stomatal responses. The v-SNARE VTI12 is involved in trafficking of storage proteins (Sanmartín et al., 2007) and a vti12 mutant showed an early-senescence phenotype under starvation conditions, suggesting that VTI12 is also involved in the autophagy pathway for the degradation of cellular contents (Surpin et al., 2003). In addition to their function together in vesicle fusion, components of the SYP41 complex therefore also appear to be involved in distinct processes, suggesting that they may function in additional SNARE complexes. In this study, we identified a novel SYP41-interacting protein that we named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein). TNO1 is a membrane protein at the TGN and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking, consistent with the hypothesis that it functions together with the SYP41 SNARE complex. A tno1 knockout mutant has a salt and osmotic stress-sensitive phenotype, possibly due to the partial mislocalization of SYP61. A brefeldin A (BFA)-treated tno1 mutant showed a delay in formation of the BFA compartment, indicating that TNO1 could be important in TGN/endosome fusion events. We propose that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt stress resistance by facilitating the vesicle fusion process. RESULTS Identification of TNO1 SYP41 is a t-SNARE at the TGN that is required for vesicle fusion in Arabidopsis and forms a complex with VTI12, SYP61, and AtVPS45 (Bassham and Raikhel, 2000; Chen et al., 2005). To identify additional SYP41-interacting proteins, detergent-solubilized membrane extracts of Arabidopsis suspension cells were immunoprecipitated using SYP41 antibody. Proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with SYP41, or with preimmune antibody as a control, were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Four bands corresponding to proteins migrating at approximately 200, 67, 35, and 15 kD were found only in the SYP41 precipitate and were not present in the SYP41 preimmune precipitate, suggesting that they specifically interacted with SYP41 (Fig. 1A). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Identification of TNO1. A, Identification of TNO1 in SYP41 immunoprecipitate. Detergent-solubilized Arabidopsis suspension cell extracts were applied to a column containing resin cross-linked to either immobilized SYP41 antibodies (I) or SYP41 preimmune serum (P). The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. p200, p67, p35, and p15 indicate the mobility of protein bands when compared with molecular mass markers. B, Coimmunoprecipitation of TNO1 with SYP41. Immunoprecipitations were performed from detergent-solubilized Arabidopsis membrane extracts using SYP41 antibodies (I) and preimmune serum (P). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against SYP41 or TNO1. C, Expression of TNO1 mRNA in Arabidopsis. RT-PCR was performed using cDNA from different tissues of Arabidopsis using TNO1- and SYP41-specific primers. 18S RNA was used as a control. R, Root; RL, rosette leaves; CL, cauline leaves; FL, flower; ST, stem.The 200-, 67-, 35-, and 15-kD bands were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, comparing the fragmentation patterns with the predicted Arabidopsis proteome. The 67- and 15-kD bands were identified as AtVPS45 and a degradation product of SYP61, respectively (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The 35-kD band contained SYP41, SYP42, and also SYP43, an additional protein in the SYP4 family that has not yet been characterized. Nine peptides from the 200-kD band (Supplemental Fig. S1B, blue bars) could be matched to the predicted protein encoded by At1g24460, corresponding to 5.2% amino acid coverage, and the protein was named TNO1. A cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame of TNO1 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. A comparison of the sequence of this cDNA with the sequence in The Arabidopsis Information Resource revealed the presence of an additional 63 bp (from 4,190 to 4,252; Supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting the presence of an extra exon in our TNO1 sequence (Supplemental Fig. S1B, red bar) and that either the predicted sequence in The Arabidopsis Information Resource has incorrectly predicted splice sites or multiple splice variants exist. TNO1, a previously uncharacterized protein of predicted mass 209 kD, was predicted to have six coiled-coil domains in the Arabi-Coil database (Rose et al., 2004) based on the MultiCoil algorithm (Wolf et al., 1997) and one transmembrane domain at the extreme C terminus by TopPred transmembrane prediction (Supplemental Fig. S2; von Heijne, 1992; Claros and von Heijne, 1994). To confirm that the approximately 200-kD band in the SYP41 precipitate corresponds to TNO1, SYP41 and preimmune immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against SYP41 or TNO1 (see below). TNO1 was detected in the SYP41 precipitate but not in the preimmune precipitate, confirming the correct identification of the 200-kD band (Fig. 1B). To investigate the expression pattern of TNO1, RT-PCR was performed using RNA extracted from different Arabidopsis plant organs. TNO1 was ubiquitously expressed in roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, and flowers, with lower expression in stems. SYP41 also showed highest expression in flowers and lowest expression in stems (Fig. 1C). Expression of TNO1 in Arabidopsis plant organs and throughout development was also analyzed using Genevestigator, a database and Web browser data-mining interface for Affymetrix GeneChip data (Hruz et al., 2008). The broad expression pattern observed was consistent with the RT-PCR results, with TNO1 found to be highly expressed during germination, flower development, and silique maturation (Supplemental Fig. S3). This expression pattern suggests that TNO1 may have an important role throughout the plant, particularly during reproductive stages.TNO1 Is a TGN-Localized Membrane Protein To study the function of TNO1, an antibody was raised against a 66-kD fragment from the C terminus of TNO1. The specificity of affinity-purified TNO1 antibody was tested by immunoblotting against total cell extract, total membrane, and total soluble proteins from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Purified TNO1 antibody specifically recognized a band of approximately 200 kD in Arabidopsis extracts (Fig. 2A) that was not detected by the preimmune serum (Fig. 2B). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Membrane association of TNO1. A and B, Detection of TNO1 using TNO1 antibody. Total protein extract (T), pellet (P), and soluble proteins (S) from Arabidopsis seedlings were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using affinity-purified TNO1 antibody (A) or TNO1 preimmune serum (B). Positions of molecular markers are shown at left. C, Differential centrifugation. Total Arabidopsis extracts (T) from 2-week-old seedlings were centrifuged sequentially at 20,000g and 100,000g, resulting in a 20,000g pellet (P20), 100,000g pellet (P100), and soluble fractions (S), followed by immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies. D, Membrane association test. Total membrane pellets from Arabidopsis seedlings were resuspended in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 m urea, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 m Na2CO3. Suspensions were recentrifuged at 125,000g to separate solubilized fractions (S) and insoluble fractions (P), which were analyzed by immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.To investigate the potential membrane association of TNO1, the presence of TNO1 in membrane fractions was analyzed. An Arabidopsis suspension cell extract was centrifuged sequentially at 20,000g and 100,000g, producing three different fractions, P20 (pellet at 20,000g), P100 (pellet at 100,000g), and S (supernatant from 100,000g). These fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies. The integral membrane protein SYP61 was detected strongly in all membrane fractions and was not present in the soluble fraction. TNO1 was also present in all the membrane fractions but not in the soluble fraction, suggesting that TNO1 is associated with membranes (Fig. 2C). The band present above the TNO1 band in the P20 fraction corresponds to the top of the gel, where occasionally some aggregated protein is seen. To determine the mode of association of TNO1 with membranes, total membrane fractions were isolated from 2-week-old seedlings and treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 m urea, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 m Na2CO3, followed by repelleting of nonsolubilized proteins. Immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies indicated that SYP41, an integral membrane protein control, was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and that TNO1 was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and partially by 2 m urea (Fig. 2D) but not by 1 m NaCl or 0.1 m Na2CO3. This suggests that TNO1 is a membrane-integrated protein, consistent with the transmembrane domain prediction of a C-terminal membrane anchor. To analyze TNO1 subcellular localization, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed and TNO1 labeling compared with that of known markers. Cotyledons of wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (see below) were immunolabeled using purified TNO1 antibody to confirm the specificity of TNO1 labeling. In wild-type seedlings, TNO1 antibody labeled endogenous TNO1 in punctate structures, while no specific signal was observed in the cotyledons of tno1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 3A), confirming the specificity of the antibody. In addition, omission of the first antibody, second antibody, and both first and second antibodies was tested as controls for nonspecific staining or cross-talk between different fluorescence channels. No specific fluorescence was observed in any of the controls (data not shown). Figure 3. Open in a new tab TNO1 is localized to the TGN. A, TNO1 antibodies specifically label punctate structures. Four-day-old wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using TNO1 antibody (left panels) and differential interference contrast (DIC; right panels). B to D, TNO1 colocalizes with VHAa1 at the TGN. Four-day-old RHA1-YFP (PVC; B), ST-GFP (Golgi; C), and VHAa1-GFP (TGN; D) transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were fixed and immunolabeled using TNO1 antibody. Bars = 10 μm.Purified TNO1 antibody was then used to label endogenous TNO1 in VHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006), truncated ST-GFP (Boevink et al., 1998), or RHA1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; Preuss et al., 2004) transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings, which label TGN, Golgi, and PVC, respectively. VHAa1-GFP, RHA1-YFP, and ST-GFP all exhibited a dot-like pattern in cotyledons, and TNO1-labeled structures completely overlapped with VHAa1-labeled structures but were distinct from those labeled with ST-GFP or RHA1-YFP (Fig. 3, B–D). This result indicates that TNO1 localizes to the TGN.Identification of the tno1 Knockout Mutant To analyze the function of TNO1, we obtained a knockout mutant containing a T-DNA insertion in the TNO1 gene. A homozygous mutant was identified by PCR of genomic DNA using TNO1 gene-specific primers (LP and RP) and a T-DNA left border primer (LBa1) in three combinations (Fig. 4A). A 900-bp fragment corresponding to the intact TNO1 gene could be amplified from genomic DNA of wild-type plants using LP and RP primers. This band was absent from the tno1 mutant due to gene disruption by the T-DNA. PCR using LBa1 and LP or RP primers generated 450-bp bands, showing the existence of a T-DNA insertion in the tno1 mutant. This indicates that the tno1 mutant has a complex insertion in its third exon, as T-DNA left border sequences are present at both ends of the insertion (Fig. 4, A and B). Lack of TNO1 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting of total protein extracts from wild-type and tno1 mutant plants using affinity-purified TNO1 antibodies (Fig. 4C). No difference in overall morphology or development was seen between tno1 mutant and wild-type plants grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium or soil throughout their life cycle. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Identification of a homozygous tno1 knockout mutant. A, T-DNA insertion site in the tno1 knockout mutant. The tno1 mutant has a complex T-DNA insertion in its third exon. Left border primer (LBa1) and TNO1 internal left (LP) and right (RP) primers were used to identify the tno1 mutant. An arrow indicates the direction of each primer. Boxes and lines indicate exons and introns, respectively. B, Identification of a homozygous tno1 knockout mutant. PCR was performed on wild-type (WT) and tno1 mutant genomic DNA using LP (TNO1 internal left)/RP (TNO1 internal right) primers and LBa1 primer from the T-DNA, producing a 900-bp band from LP and RP primers and a 450-bp band from LBa1 and either LP or RP primers. C, Lack of TNO1 in the tno1 mutant. Membrane extracts from wild-type and tno1 mutant plants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using TNO1 antibody. Positions of molecular markers are shown at left. D, Expression of TNO1 in the tno1 complemented line. Membrane extracts from wild-type and tno1/TNO1 promoter::TNO1 plants (COM) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using TNO1 antibody. tno1 Mutant Plants Are Sensitive to Salt and Osmotic Stress SYP61/OSM1, a t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex, has been reported to be involved in general salt/osmotic stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). As TNO1 also interacts with SYP41, TNO1 was hypothesized to be involved in similar stress responses. Therefore, the sensitivity of homozygous tno1 mutant plants to salt, ionic, and osmotic stresses was tested. Wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 5 d and transferred to MS solid medium containing 130 mm NaCl (Fig. 5, C and G), 140 mm KCl (Fig. 5, D and H), 17 mm LiCl (Fig. 5, E and I), or 300 mm mannitol (Fig. 5, F and J), and root length was measured after 4 and 8 d. Under normal growth conditions, tno1 and wild-type seedlings were indistinguishable (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, tno1 mutant seedlings exhibited shorter roots and earlier leaf chlorosis than wild-type seedlings under Na+, K+, Li+, and nonionic osmotic stresses. This result shows that lack of TNO1 causes sensitivity to salt and osmotic stresses. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The tno1 mutant is sensitive to salt, ionic, and osmotic stresses. A, Wild-type, tno1 mutant, and TNO1 complemented seedlings were grown vertically on MS solid medium for 4 d after germination.

Error bars represent sd (n = 30 for each genotype). C to F, Wild-type, tno1 mutant, and TNO1 complemented seedlings were grown vertically on MS solid medium for 5 d, transferred to MS plates containing 130 mm NaCl (C), 140 mm KCl (D), 17 mm LiCl (E), or 300 mm mannitol (F), and grown inverted. Photographs were taken after 1 week. G to J, Root growth under salt, ionic, and osmotic stress conditions. Seeds were germinated on MS plates containing 130 mm NaCl (G), 140 mm KCl (H), 17 mm LiCl (I), or 300 mm mannitol (J), and the root length was measured at 4 and 8 d after germination. Error bars represent sd (n = 18 for each genotype).To confirm that the observed phenotype of the tno1 mutant is due to disruption of the TNO1 gene, a genomic fragment of TNO1 including the native promoter was introduced into the tno1 mutant. TNO1 expression was restored to approximately wild-type levels in the tno1/TNO1 promoter::TNO1 lines as determined by immunoblotting using TNO1 antibody (Fig. 4D). This TNO1 genomic fragment complemented the salt-, ionic-, and osmotic-sensitive phenotype of the tno1 mutant (Fig. 5). To test whether the expression of salt or osmotic stress-responsive genes was altered in the tno1 mutant, expression of TNO1, SYP61, and known salt (SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1 [SOS1]) or osmotic (RD29 and DRE-BINDING PROTEIN [DREB2A]) stress-responsive genes was analyzed by RT-PCR. TNO1 was expressed at a basal level in the nontreated condition, and its mRNA level increased slightly during NaCl and KCl treatment, while no expression of TNO1 was detected in the tno1 mutant, as expected (Supplemental Fig. S4). An increase in the transcript level of SYP61 was observed in both wild-type and tno1 mutant plants in all stress conditions. SOS1, DREB2A, and RD29 increased as expected (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993b; Liu et al., 1998; Qiu et al., 2004), and no difference between wild-type and tno1 mutant plants was observed (Supplemental Fig. S4). This result suggests that the phenotype of the tno1 mutant is not caused by disruption of the expression of genes involved in salt or osmotic stress responses.SYP61 Is Partially Mislocalized in the tno1 Mutant TNO1 interacts with the SYP41 complex, and the tno1 mutant has a phenotype similar to that of the syp61 mutant. Thus, we hypothesized that a mutation in TNO1 may affect components of the SYP41 complex. The localization of SYP61 and SYP41 was investigated in wild-type and tno1 mutant protoplasts. Previously, SYP61 has been shown to colocalize with VHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006). To investigate the localization of SYP61 in the tno1 mutant, a VHAa1-GFP transgenic tno1 mutant was generated. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using protoplasts generated from VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1 mutant plants, and the percentage colocalization (SYP61-labeled structures overlapping with VHAa1/total SYP61-labeled structures) was analyzed in ImageJ (Abramoff et al., 2004) using the colocalization finder plugin. In wild-type protoplasts, 70% of SYP61 colocalized with VHAa1-GFP, while 47% of SYP61 was found to colocalize with VHAa1-GFP in the tno1 mutant protoplasts (Fig. 6). This difference was statistically significant (t test, P = 0.00011; n = 17). When colocalization of SYP41 with VHAa1-GFP was compared between the wild type and the tno1 mutant, no difference was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that loss of TNO1 specifically affects the localization of SYP61 and not SYP41. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Mislocalization of SYP61 in the tno1 mutant. A, Colocalization of SYP61 or SYP41 with VHAa1-GFP in the wild type (WT) and the tno1 mutant. Protoplasts were isolated from leaves of VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type plants and VHAa1-GFP transgenic tno1 mutants and fixed, followed by immunofluorescence labeling using SYP61 or SYP41 antibodies. Bars = 10 μm. B, Quantification of colocalization of SYP61 and SYP41 with VHAa1-GFP in the wild type and the tno1 mutant. Percentage of colocalization of SYP61 or SYP41 with VHAa1 was determined. Error bars represent sd (n = 17). Results shown are averages of three independent experiments. The asterisk shows a statistically significant difference between the wild type and the tno1 mutant (t test; P = 0.00011).Lack of TNO1 Causes the Secretion of Vacuolar Proteins Disruption of vacuolar transport typically leads to the secretion of vacuolar proteins by a default pathway (Shimada et al., 1997, 2003a). Previously, disruption of either of the SYP41-interacting proteins, AtVPS45 or VTI12, was shown to cause the secretion of aleurain and of a vacuolar marker consisting of CLAVATA3 fused to the vacuolar sorting signal from barley (Hordeum vulgare) lectin (Sanmartín et al., 2007; Zouhar et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that lack of TNO1 may also cause the secretion of vacuolar proteins. To test the potential involvement of TNO1 in vacuolar trafficking, we compared the amount of the vacuolar proteins Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP), RD21, and invertase in wild-type and tno1 mutant vacuoles. Vacuoles were isolated from wild-type plants and tno1 mutants and analyzed by immunoblotting using AALP, RD21, and invertase antibodies. No significant differences were seen between wild-type and tno1 mutant plants, suggesting that overall vacuolar trafficking is not inhibited in the tno1 mutant (Fig. 7A). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Secretion of vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant. A, Comparison of vacuolar proteins in the wild type (WT) and the tno1 knockout mutant (KO). Vacuoles were isolated from leaves of wild-type and tno1 mutant plants and analyzed by immunoblotting using AALP, RD21, and invertase antibodies. The amount of vacuolar proteins loaded is shown at the top. B, Secretion of vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant. ICFs were harvested from the wild type, the tno1 knockout mutant, and the TNO1 complemented line (COM) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using AALP, RD21, invertase, ChlI, and PEX11d antibodies. ChlI and PEX11d were used to show equal cell breakage. TOT-ICF, Extract after collection of ICF.Although the tno1 mutant does not appear to have a general block in vacuolar trafficking, this does not preclude a mild or partial disruption in this pathway, as seen in a vti12 mutant (Sanmartín et al., 2007). Thus, intercellular wash fluid (ICF) was collected from leaves of wild-type and tno1 mutant plants to determine whether any vacuolar proteins were partially secreted (Neuhaus et al., 1991). Proteins in the ICF were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against AALP, RD21, and invertase, with the cytoplasmic proteins ChlI (stromal) and PEX11d (peroxisomal) used as controls to rule out differences in cell breakage between mutant and wild-type plants. AALP, RD21, and invertase bands in ICF-depleted leaf extract showed no difference between the wild type and the tno1 mutant, as expected from the above results with isolated vacuoles. However, the tno1 mutant had increased levels of AALP and RD21 in the ICF compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that lack of TNO1 caused some secretion of AALP and RD21 (Fig. 7B). By contrast, no secretion of vacuolar invertase was observed, although vacuolar invertase was suggested previously to be transported to the vacuole by a similar pathway to RD21 (Rojo et al., 2003). RD21, therefore, may have an alternative or additional transport pathway to the vacuole. These data suggest that TNO1 is required for efficient trafficking of some vacuolar proteins.Involvement of TNO1 in Vesicle Fusion In Arabidopsis, the trafficking inhibitor BFA targets the Arf-GEF GNOM and induces the formation of BFA compartments (Geldner et al., 2001), most likely by homotypic fusion of the TGN (which is also an early endosome) and heterotypic fusion between the TGN and other endosomes (Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2009; Viotti et al., 2010). Therefore, SNAREs at the TGN mayfunction in these fusion events upon BFA treatment. As TNO1 interacts with SYP41 and loss of TNO1 disrupts the localization of SYP61, TNO1 could be involved in membrane fusion at the TGN together with the SYP41 complex. Therefore, formation of the BFA compartment in VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings was investigated. Without BFA treatment, there was no difference in the appearance of VHAa1-GFP-positive structures in roots and cotyledons between wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 8, A–D). After 1 h of BFA treatment, VHAa1-GFP accumulated in the BFA compartments in roots of wild-type seedlings, as reported previously, and in tno1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 8, E and F; Dettmer et al., 2006). In wild-type cotyledons, the BFA compartments were seen in the peripheral region. By contrast, VHAa1-GFP in tno1 mutant cotyledons did not accumulate in BFA compartments after 1 h of BFA treatment (Fig. 8, G and H). VHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartments in cotyledons of the tno1 mutant could be seen only after 5 h of BFA treatment (Fig. 8K). No difference was seen in recovery from BFA treatment between wild-type and tno1 mutant plants (Fig. 8, I and J). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Delayed formation of a BFA compartment in the tno1 mutant and localization of TNO1 upon BFA treatment. A to D, VHAa1-GFP in the wild type (WT) and the tno1 knockout mutant (KO) without BFA treatment. TGN is labeled with VHAa1-GFP in roots of wild-type (A) and tno1 mutant (B) plants and in cotyledons of wild-type (C) and tno1 mutant (D) plants. E to K, Formation of the BFA compartment in the wild type and the tno1 mutant. Wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were treated with 50 μg mL−1 BFA in liquid medium for either 1 h (E–H) or 5 h (K). For the recovery, BFA-treated seedlings were washed twice with the same medium and incubated for 1 h (I and J). Formation of the BFA compartment in roots of wild-type (E) and tno1 mutant (F) plants and in cotyledons of wild-type plants (G) was observed after 1 h of BFA treatment. Formation of the BFA compartment in cotyledons of tno1 mutant plants was not observed after 1 h of BFA treatment (H) but was seen after 5 h of BFA treatment (K). Recovery from BFA treatment in cotyledons of wild-type (I) and tno1 knockout mutant (J) plants was indistinguishable. L to O, Localization of TNO1 after BFA treatment. VHAa1-GFP transgenic seedlings were treated with 50 μg mL−1 BFA in liquid medium for 2 h and fixed, followed by immunofluorescence using TNO1 antibody. Arrows indicate the BFA compartment, and arrowheads indicate small punctate structures, presumably TGN. DIC, Differential interference contrast. Bars = 10 μm.The response of TNO1 to BFA treatment was also investigated. VHAa1-GFP transgenic seedlings were treated in MS liquid medium supplemented with 50 μm BFA for 2 h, followed by fixing and immunolabeling using TNO1 antibody. TNO1 was not found in the VHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartment but instead remained in small punctate structures similar to those in the absence of BFA. After BFA treatment, TNO1 colocalized with the remaining small VHAa1-GFP-labeled structures (Fig. 8, L–O), suggesting that TNO1 is present in TGN remnants that do not undergo fusion. Together, these results suggest that lack of TNO1 delays homotypic fusion between TGN or fusion between TGN and other endosomes in cotyledons. The BFA compartment, therefore, forms more slowly in the tno1 mutant, presumably due to delayed fusion. TNO1 may function in maintaining TGN structure or identity, marking TGN remnants that do not participate in BFA compartment formation.DISCUSSION Identity of TNO1 TNO1 was identified as a novel protein that coimmunoprecipitates with SYP41. As SYP41 is a t-SNARE residing at the TGN, we hypothesize that TNO1 may also be involved in vesicle fusion at this organelle. We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking. Based on the effects of BFA treatment, TNO1 is proposed to be involved in the formation of the BFA compartment and may function in maintaining TGN structure or identity. When we analyzed its potential domain structure using the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool, two previously characterized domains (SMC_prok_B and SMC_N) containing long coiled-coil regions for protein interaction were identified in TNO1 (Akhmedov et al., 1998; Geer et al., 2002). Although SMC domains are commonly found in structural maintenance of chromosome proteins, they are also found in other proteins with multiple coiled-coil domains, such as vesicle-tethering factors and cytoskeleton-binding proteins. A search for proteins with sequence similarity to TNO1 using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., 1997, 2005) identified several hypothetical proteins from other plant species as most closely related to TNO1. In addition, myosin-related proteins, a putative ATP-binding protein, and tethering factors including USO1 in yeast, tgolgin-1 in mouse, and gigantin in human were identified with high significance, primarily due to the presence of long coiled-coil regions in these proteins. USO1, which has 20% amino acid sequence identity and 39% amino acid similarity to TNO1, is a tethering factor involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking that tethers COPII vesicles at the cis-Golgi (Cao et al., 1998). Tethering factors have been reported to function in vesicle fusion by interacting with their tethering partner to pull vesicles close to their target membrane (Cao et al., 1998). Some are also involved in maintaining organelle structure and assisting in the formation of SNARE complexes via direct interaction with a SNARE (Shorter et al., 2002; Vasile et al., 2003). The presence of multiple predicted coiled-coil domains and the similarity to USO1 suggest that TNO1 could be a tethering factor at the TGN.Phenotype of the tno1 Knockout Mutant To determine the function of TNO1, the tno1 mutant was isolated and four major phenotypes were identified: sensitivity to high salt and osmotic stress, partial secretion of some vacuolar proteins, mislocalization of SYP61, and delayed BFA compartment formation in cotyledon cells. Differing effects on salt tolerance have been seen for mutations in different trafficking proteins. Knockdown of AtVAMP7C, a v-SNARE involved in vesicle fusion with the vacuole, was found to confer salt tolerance by preventing hydrogen peroxide-containing vesicles from fusing with the tonoplast (Leshem et al., 2006). Knockout of SYP22, a t-SNARE in the PVC and tonoplast, also increased salt tolerance in shoots, and a decreased level of Na+ in shoots was observed (Hamaji et al., 2009). Thus, vesicle fusion appears to directly or indirectly affect salt tolerance at the PVC and vacuoles. By contrast, the tno1 mutant and a mutation in SYP61 (Zhu et al., 2002) showed a salt-sensitive phenotype. TNO1 and SYP61 colocalize to the TGN and are likely to exist in the same protein complex. The salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1 mutant may be due to its effect on SYP61 (Fig. 6). In the tno1 mutant, less SYP61 colocalized with VHAa1-GFP-labeled TGN compared with wild-type plants, leading to possible reduced SYP61 function in salt tolerance. It was hypothesized that a cation transporter in the osm1/syp61 mutant may not function correctly, affecting guard cell turgor and salt sensitivity (Zhu et al., 2002). Extensive investigations of cation transporters in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells have shown that cation/H+ antiporters in the Golgi, TGN, endosome, and PVC regulate the pH and cation concentration in these organelles, affecting vesicle trafficking, and knockdown of VHAa1 in Arabidopsis also leads to increased salt sensitivity (Brett et al., 2002, 2005; Nakamura et al., 2005; Pardo et al., 2006; Fuji et al., 2007; Krebs et al., 2010). Thus, one possibility is that the salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1 and osm1/syp61 mutants could be caused by defects in the transport of cation/H+ antiporters or in the function of cation/H+ antiporters at the TGN. Another noticeable phenotype is the secretion of normally vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant. Analysis of ICF from the tno1 mutant demonstrated partial secretion of AALP, in common with mutants in the additional SYP41 complex components VPS45 and VTI12 (Sanmartín et al., 2007; Zouhar et al., 2009). AALP has dual vacuolar targeting signals and is a cargo for VSR1 (Hinz et al., 2007). Therefore, TNO1, AtVPS45, and VTI12 may cooperate in VSR1-mediated vacuolar trafficking via recycling of VSR1 from PVC to TGN. RD21 is another protein that is partially secreted in the tno1 mutant. RD21 is a Cys protease like AALP but is probably transported via a VSR1-independent pathway. RD21 and invertase are transported to the vacuole by ER bodies rather than by the VSR1-mediated transport pathway (Hayashi et al., 2001; Rojo et al., 2003); however, invertase was not secreted in the tno1 mutant. This result may indicate that RD21 can follow an alternative transport pathway to the vacuole. Protein profiles from isolated vacuoles of wild-type and tno1 mutant leaf protoplasts were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but no significant differences were observed (data not shown). This is most likely due to only a small fraction of proteins being secreted, with most protein still being correctly transported to the vacuole. The partial secretion of vacuolar proteins, therefore, may be an indirect effect of the loss of TNO1. Although salt sensitivity and secretion of some vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant may appear to be independent phenotypes, these two phenotypes are closely related. A connection between salt sensitivity and vacuolar trafficking has been well established. In yeast and mammalian cells, post-Golgi organelles involved in vacuolar trafficking were shown to be targets for salt stress, resulting in inefficient vacuolar trafficking (Bachert et al., 2001; Pardo et al., 2006; Hernández et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis, the endocytic pathway to the vacuole has also been shown to be important for salt tolerance (Leshem et al., 2006, 2007). Thus, our results provide additional evidence that vacuolar trafficking is important for salt tolerance.BFA Treatment In this study, we used BFA to investigate the involvement of TNO1 in fusion events, as TNO1 is a member of a protein complex predicted to be required for membrane fusion at the TGN and BFA treatment causes the formation of BFA compartments by fusion between multiple types of endosomes. As expected, VHAa1-GFP transgenic plants formed BFA compartments after 1 h of BFA treatment, but VHAa1-GFP transgenic tno1 mutant plants showed formation of BFA compartments only after 5 h of BFA treatment in cotyledon cells, while mutant root cells behaved identically to wild-type cells in this assay. This delay in BFA compartment formation implies that TNO1 could be involved in homotypic fusion of the TGN/early endosomes or fusion between TGN and other types of endosomes upon BFA treatment. VHAa1-GFP and TNO1 colocalize extensively under normal conditions; however, loss of colocalization was observed upon BFA treatment, indicating that TNO1 does not enter BFA compartments (Fig. 8). A similar effect was observed for the mammalian golgin GM130, which, unlike most Golgi proteins, does not relocate to the ER in the presence of BFA (Seemann et al., 2000). GM130 is a tethering factor that also interacts with SNAREs during vesicle fusion and a Golgi matrix protein required for the integrity of the Golgi structure (Diao et al., 2008). After BFA treatment, GM130 remains in a Golgi remnant, while Golgi luminal proteins are transported back to the ER, indicating that GM130 is involved in maintaining Golgi structure (Seemann et al., 2000). Although there is no sequence homology between TNO1 and GM130, based on the properties of TNO1, it is possible that TNO1 also functions as a tethering factor and is involved in maintaining TGN structure or identity. In vitro fusion assays using recombinant TNO1 and TGN SNAREs may provide insight into the role of TNO1 in membrane fusion events.MATERIALS AND METHODS Identification of TNO1 Protein extracts were made essentially as described by Bassham et al. (2000) and Sanderfoot et al. (2001a). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspension cells were ground in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% [v/v] Triton X-100) and solubilized for 2 h at 4°C. Solubilized proteins were added to a column containing immobilized SYP41 antibodies or SYP41 preimmune serum and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 0.2 m Gly, pH 2.5. Immunoprecipitates from SYP41 and preimmune antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver staining. Protein bands migrating at approximate molecular masses of 200, 67, 35, and 15 kD were excised and analyzed at the Protein Microsequencing and Proteomic Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Worchester, MA). Proteins were digested in gel using trypsin, the resulting peptides were applied to a Finnigan Electrospray LCQ Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer, and the peptide masses were used to identify potential matches within the Arabidopsis proteome.cDNA Cloning and Sequencing RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis siliques and treated with DNase I, followed by RT using an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were amplified using Herculase Long and Accurate Polymerase Mix (Agilent Technologies) and TNO1 cDNA forward and reverse primers (Table I) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The amplification product was inserted into pGEM T-Easy vector (Invitrogen), and DNA sequencing was performed at the W.M. Keck Foundation (Yale University). The sequence was deposited in GenBank (accession no. HM776995). Table I. Primer sequences. The restriction sites used for cloning are underlined.

A tno1 knockout mutant line (Salk_112503) that has a T-DNA insertion in the third exon was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. A homozygous tno1 mutant was identified by PCR using TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers and T-DNA left border-a1 primer (Table I).Generation of Transgenic Plants GFP-fused vacuolar H+-ATPase (GFP-VHAa1) plasmid (Dettmer et al., 2006) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was used to transform tno1 mutant plants by the floral dipping method (Clough and Bent, 1998). The resulting VHAa1-GFP-transformed tno1 plants were selected on MS solid medium containing 50 μg mL−1 kanamycin. For tno1 mutant complementation, the full-length TNO1 gene and its promoter were separately amplified by PCR with TNO1 promoter primers and genomic TNO1 primers with corresponding restriction sites (Table I). The TNO1 promoter fragment was digested using SalI and NotI, and the TNO1 genomic fragment was digested using NotI and KpnI. The digested TNO1 promoter and genomic DNA were ligated into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300MCS1 digested using SalI and KpnI (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The resulting plasmid was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was used to transform tno1 mutant plants. The transgenic tno1 mutant plants were identified by resistance to 50 μg mL−1 hygromycin and immunoblotting with TNO1 antibody.RT-PCR Analysis of TNO1, SYP41, and Salt/Osmotic Stress-Responsive Genes Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis organs using the TRIzol RNA isolation method (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). Roots were harvested from 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture (MS plus 1% [w/v] Suc), and stems, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, flowers, and siliques were harvested from 7-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Extracted RNA was treated with DNase I, followed by RT using an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were amplified for 25 cycles using TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers or SYP41 forward and reverse primers (Table I). One-week-old wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were treated with 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm LiCl, 300 mm KCl, or 600 mm mannitol for 5 h. Total RNA was extracted from the seedlings, and expression of SOS1, DREB2A, RD29, TNO1, and SYP61 was analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers (Table I; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993a; Liu et al., 1998; Shi et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2002).Antibody Production and Purification A 1.7-kb C-terminal fragment of the TNO1 cDNA was cloned into pET28b(+) expression vector (Novagen) to produce a His-partial TNO1 fusion construct. The fusion protein construct was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and expression and purification of partial TNO1 were as described by Bassham et al. (2000). The partial TNO1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and used to immunize rabbits at Cocalico Biologicals after gel purification. For purification of TNO1-specific antibodies, purified His-tagged TNO1 protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by staining with Ponceau S, and the strip containing the fusion protein was cut out. The strip was blocked in 3% (w/v) dried nonfat milk in PBS, and crude rabbit serum was incubated with the strip for 2 h at 4°C. The strip was washed five times with PBS, and antibodies were eluted using 0.1 m Gly, pH 2.2.Differential Centrifugation Arabidopsis plants were homogenized in 0.3 m Suc, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000g, then the supernatant was removed and further centrifuged at 100,000g. The TCA-precipitated supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000g and pellets after centrifugation at 20,000g and 100,000g were analyzed by immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a).Extraction of TNO1 from Membranes Total membrane fractions were isolated from 2-week-old seedlings by centrifugation at 125,000g and treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 m urea, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 m Na2CO3 followed by pelleting of nonsolubilized proteins at 125,000g (Phan et al., 2008). Pellets and TCA-precipitated supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.ICF Extraction ICF was extracted as described (Neuhaus et al., 1991). One gram of Arabidopsis leaves was infiltrated under vacuum in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. After infiltration, surface dried leaves were rolled with filter paper and inserted into a 10-mL syringe. The syringe was inserted into a 50-mL conical tube, which was centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 10°C. ICF was collected in the bottom of the tube, and ICF-depleted leaves after centrifugation were ground in 50 mm sodium citrate for the control. ICF and ICF-depleted protein extract were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-AALP (1:1,000; Ahmed et al., 2000), anti-RD21 (1:1,000; Hayashi et al., 2001), anti-invertase (1:3,000; Rojo et al., 2003), anti-ChlI (1:2,000; Adhikari et al., 2009), and anti-PEX11d (1:1,000; Orth et al., 2007).Preparation of Vacuoles Leaf protoplasts were generated as described (Sheen, 2002). After harvesting protoplasts, vacuole isolation was performed as described (Robert et al., 2007). After adding 6 mL of prewarmed lysis buffer (0.2 m mannitol, 10% [w/v] Ficoll, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Na phosphate, pH 8.0) at 42°C, lysed protoplasts were transferred to clear tubes for a SW41 swinging-bucket rotor (Beckman-Coulter) and overlaid with 3 mL of 4% (w/v) Ficoll (by mixing lysis and vacuole buffer) and 1 mL of vacuole buffer (0.45 m mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Na phosphate, pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 50 min at 10°C. Vacuoles were recovered from the interface between 4% (w/v) Ficoll and vacuole buffer.Immunofluorescence Three- or 4-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS solid medium were immunolabeled with a protocol slightly modified from Phan et al. (2008). Seedlings used were ST-GFP transgenic plants (Boevink et al., 1998), VHAa1-GFP transgenic plants (Dettmer et al., 2006), and RHA1-YFP transgenic plants (Preuss et al., 2004) to label Golgi, TGN, and PVC, respectively. For protoplast immunofluorescence, protoplasts were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in MTSB (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgSO4) with 0.4 m sorbitol for 30 min and washed twice with MTSB with 0.4 m sorbitol. Fixed protoplasts were mounted onto slides and dried for 1 h. Protoplasts were permeabilized using permeabilization buffer (0.5% [v/v] Nonidet P-40 and 10% [v/v] dimethyl sulfoxide in MTSB) for 30 min in a moist chamber followed by washing three times using MTSB. Samples were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in MTSB for 2 h, and primary antibodies in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB were added. After 3 h of incubation, protoplasts were washed three times using MTSB and treated with conjugated secondary antibody in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB for 50 min followed by washing five times with MTSB. Anti-TNO1 (1:25), anti-SYP41 (1:50), and anti-SYP61 (1:50) were used as primary antibodies. AlexaFluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) was used as secondary antibody. Fluorescent signals were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems). Excitation and emission wavelengths of GFP were 488 and 500 nm and those of AlexaFluor 594 were 590 and 600 nm, respectively.Salt, Ionic, and Osmotic Stresses and Drug Treatment For stress treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 5 d and transferred to MS solid medium containing 130 mm NaCl, 17 mm LiCl, 140 mm KCl, or 300 mm mannitol, followed by growth for an additional 10 d (Zhu et al., 2002). For BFA treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 4 d and transferred to MS liquid medium containing 50 μm BFA or dimethyl sulfoxide as carrier control for 5 h. Seedlings were washed twice with MS liquid medium and incubated in MS liquid medium for recovery. BFA treatment of protoplasts was performed as above for 2 h with the same concentration of BFA.

    "abstract": "Abstract SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions. Keywords: glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking, trans-Golgi network",
    "introduction": "Introduction An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”. In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004). Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network). syp42−/−syp43−/− double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces orontii infection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012). A research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures are N-glycans, O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood. In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP.",

DeepTMHMM (Hallgren et al. 2022; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed Nov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction model for this protein indicates a presence of a single transmembrane helix near the N-terminus of AtGTLP protein (residues 24–44). The short N-terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45–568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. 2021) model of AtGTLP’s three-dimensional structure includes a globular domain of unknown function in the C-terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). The C-terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while N-terminal part had a lower reliability score (Figure 1C–E). Figure 1. (A) Schematic model of AtGTLP topology and (B) AlphaFold2 prediction of the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP.

The region in white in AtGTLP is the N-terminal region that was not included in the superposition. The gradation coloring scheme was employed from N-terminal to C-terminal side on the superposed region. Human O-fucosyltransferase 2 is colored in gray with GDP analogue in ball-and-stick model which suggests the active site of the protein. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone is 5.9 Å. The similarity of the location of α-helices can be noticed. Open in a new tabAnalysis of AtGTLP’s amino acid sequence using Phyre2 server (Kelley et al. 2015; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index, accessed Nov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between the C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.2% confidence), protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well as C. elegans protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% i.d., 98.9% confidence) and protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown in Figure 1F. Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database (Lu et al. 2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of ‘O-FUT-like’ domain in the C-terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as a query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature (Smith et al. 2018) were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as ‘GTnc’. AtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans-Golgi To investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP-tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP protein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures scattered within the cell (Figure 2). Figure 2. Subcellular localization of AtGTLP.

Open in a new tabIn order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double-visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with various RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with trans-Golgi marker, ST (Boevink et al. 1998) was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs (Figure 3; PCC=0.5–0.91; median=0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to trans-Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk-like structures, patches of magenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those structures were also visible (Figure 2A, ‘close-up’). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that within trans-Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker (Figure 2B; Uemura et al. 2004), was analyzed (Figure 3; 0.21–0.83, median=0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP-mGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of a single disk-like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), for the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair a slight shift between those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B). Figure 3. Colocalization of AtGTLP with organelle markers. As a mean of assessing the degree of colocalization, for each marker line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP and organelle marker fused with RFP Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for 45 ROIs hand-drawn around clusters of dot-like structures. Three separate images were analyzed (15 ROIs/image) for each marker. Median is shown for each marker. Open in a new tabFigure 4.

Open in a new tabMoreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 (Figure 2C; Uemura et al. 2004) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D; Dettmer et al. 2006), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was close to zero (Figure 3; PCC=0.0–0.65; median=0.41 and PCC=−0.01–0.79; median=0.46, respectively). Side-view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show a similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks (Figure 4C, D). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43 (Uemura et al. 2004), we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure 2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values (Figure 3; −0.17–0.64, with median of 0.26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E). Taking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two transport pathway markers—VAMP721, a marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar transport (Shimizu and Uemura 2022)—were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure 2F, Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure 3; −0.48–0.48, median=0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G, Figure 3; PCC=0.01–0.7, median=0.42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair also show a pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP-SYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, ‘free’ dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP-mGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, arrowheads). atgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes According to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas; Klepikova et al. 2016), AtGTLP is expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds. In both mutant lines used in this study, T-DNA insertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP’s exon (Figure 5A). Although the results of RT-PCR confirmed that transcription of AtGTLP in both of the T-DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method (Figure 5B), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences between atgtlp-1 or atgtlp-2 single mutants and wild-type plants in 8-day-old and 11-day-old seedlings (Figure 5C, D).

    "discussion": "Discussion Trans-Golgi localization of AtGTLP In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP colocalized well with the trans-Golgi marker, ST, as well as with the Golgi marker, GOS12. Based on these results, we consider AtGTLP to be a resident Golgi protein, localizing mainly to trans-Golgi. Furthermore, the ring-like appearance of AtGTLP-mGFP fluorescence suggest that it localizes mainly to the rim of Golgi cisternae (Tie et al. 2018). The results of this study showed that the predicted characteristics of AtGTLP match that of glycosyltransferases. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation processes are commonly thought to occur mainly in ER and Golgi (Hansen et al. 2010). In plants, biosynthesis of many cell wall polysaccharides, another process that involves GTs, was also reported to take place in Golgi (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al. 2004). Predicted topology model of AtGTLP suggests that it possesses a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail and a single transmembrane helix, while its globular functional domain is positioned inside the lumen. Such topology, often described as ‘type II topology’ in literature, is common among Golgi-resident enzymes known to take part in protein glycosylation processes (Banfield 2011; Hansen et al. 2010; Welch and Munro 2019). Our data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially colocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, and to a lesser extent, SYP43, in a portion of the analyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was close to 0, which suggests no colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is a vesicular-tubular compartment adjacent to the trans side of a Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be a distinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi (Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, existence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi-associated TGN (GA-TGN) and Golgi-independent TGN (free-TGN/GI-TGN)—a subpopulation of the TGN that is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has been reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008; Uemura et al. 2014; Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion (Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination (Keller and Simons 1997). In addition to TGN-resident SNAREs, involved in transport, other TGN-localized proteins include lipid-processing enzymes, which help to pack cargo proteins into transport vesicles (Gu et al. 2001). Glycosylation is a sequential process, in which different types of sugar are added to glycans in a specific order, as the modified macromolecule travels from ER through Golgi apparatus to finally reach the TGN. In mammalian cells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic acid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN-localized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995; Stanley 2011). In plants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase activity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we therefore propose that AtGTLP is a trans-Golgi-localized protein. AtGTLP—a novel fucosyltransferase? Analysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown that its C-terminal domain bears resemblance to the conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, although no obvious sequence similarity was found between AtGTLP and the proteins which have been previously classified as members of FUT family in Arabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence that would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we consider that this protein may potentially belong to a yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with either GT or FUT activity. One interesting possibility that is worth considering is that AtGTLP is indeed a POFUT. Phylogenetic analyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest plant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from POFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and POFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2019). Interestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis putative POFUT, O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface, was reported to diverge from this pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of AtOFT1 has shown that it exhibits a relatively high sequence identity to members of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative POFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). As in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be potentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility that yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more related to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported POFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further examinations. In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP localizes mainly to trans-Golgi. Human POFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and Haltiwanger 2005; Luo et al. 2006), where the O-glycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley 2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, SPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm (Bi et al. 2023; Kumar et al. 2023; Zentella et al. 2023). However, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with this subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other hand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 (Robichaux et al. 2023; Smith et al. 2018), as well as FRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 (Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to localize to Golgi. In addition, α1,3-fucosylation in sycamore cells, as well as α1,4-fucosylation by FUT13 in Arabidopsis was shown to occur mainly in trans-Golgi cisternae (Fitchette-Lainé et al. 1994; Schoberer et al. 2013), suggesting that fucose is available at plant Golgi to be used as a substrate. In relation to AtGTLP showing distant similarity to metazoan POFUTs, alternative possibility is that it may be a new type of plant fucosyltransferase. One type of macromolecules, which contain fucose are pectic polysaccharides—RG-I and RG-II. At present, biosynthesis of RG-I and RG-II is not fully understood, and no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked to synthesis of RG-I and RG-II side chains, has been identified (Soto et al. 2019; Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting that yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is present in plants and responsible for this process. GTs are a diverse family of enzymes and very few members of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been well-characterized thus far. Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as its trans-Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence of O-FUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions, atgtlp−/− single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col-0 plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows a very high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential candidate. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, as well as the biological role of AtGTLP.",

Copyright notice ID: 11500582 PMID: 39464868 Abstract SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions. Keywords: glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking, trans-Golgi networkIntroduction An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”. In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004). Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network). syp42−/−syp43−/− double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces orontii infection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012). A research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures are N-glycans, O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood. In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP.Materials and methods Plant material and growth conditions For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22°C in long-day light (16 h/8 h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was adjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of 5-day-old seedlings. For analysis of mutant phenotype, two T-DNA insertion lines SALK_025999 (atgtlp-1) and SALK_011654 (atgtlp-2) were used. Columbia-0 accession plants were used as a control. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for colocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root length and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11-day-old) were used for each genotype.RNA extraction and RT-PCR RNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedling with RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100 mg of fresh tissue was used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). 5 µg of the extracted RNA was added to each reaction as a template. The presence or lack of AtGTLP expression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). 1 µg of cDNA was used as a template. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Gene cloning A 5.1 kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter and AtGTLP (At2g04280) gene sequence flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR® GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into a pENTR™ vector using pENTR™/D-TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (ThermoFisher Scientific). Transformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg l−1 and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) (Segami et al. 2014) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competent E. coli cells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector (Karimi et al. 2002) as the destination vector in Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific). AtGTLP-mGFP in pHGW construct was transformed into competent E. coli cells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100 mg l−1 spectinomycin. For creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion between mRFP (Campbell et al. 2002) and GOS12 were generated by inserting cDNA encoding mRFP in front of the start codon of GOS12 genomic sequence including 1.9 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence and 1.2 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence in pENTR™ vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase™ II (Nakagawa et al. 2007). Primers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Generation of Arabidopsis transformants Col-0 plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with the prepared plasmid containing the AtGTLP-mGFP construct using flower dip method (Clough and Bent 1998). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar with 25 mg l−1 of hygromycin and 250 mg l−1 of claforan. Selection of T1 lines with a single AtGTLP-mGFP construct was conducted by sowing T2 seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single-insertion lines.Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations For subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 (Uemura et al. 2019) and tagRFP-VAMP727 (Ebine et al. 2008) lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61 (Shimizu et al. 2021), mRFP-SYP43 (Asaoka et al. 2013), and VHAa1-mRFP (Dettmer et al. 2006) lines were used as TGN markers. ST-mRFP was used as a trans-Golgi marker (Uemura et al. 2012) and mRFP-GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study). Colocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488 nm and 543 nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU.Colocalization analysis The degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (Adler and Parmryd 2010; Dunn et al. 2011). To obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software (Schindelin et al. 2012) was used. For each organelle marker, three 50 µm×50 µm images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot-like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the ‘Smooth’ function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.Results AtGTLP is a putative glycosyltransferase AtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein comprising of 568 residues. DeepTMHMM (Hallgren et al. 2022; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed Nov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction model for this protein indicates a presence of a single transmembrane helix near the N-terminus of AtGTLP protein (residues 24–44). The short N-terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45–568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. 2021) model of AtGTLP’s three-dimensional structure includes a globular domain of unknown function in the C-terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). The C-terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while N-terminal part had a lower reliability score (Figure 1C–E). Figure 1. (A) Schematic model of AtGTLP topology and (B) AlphaFold2 prediction of the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP. AtGTLP comprises of a short N-terminal tail, single transmembrane helix and globular domain in the C-terminal part of amino-acid sequence positioned on a short stalk (type II topology).

An α-helix at the bottom is the N-terminal side. Blue color indicates less reliable region and red color indicates region with high reliability. Note that the region with similar structure to O-fucosyltransferase 2 has high reliability. (E) Predicted Alignment Error (PAE). N-terminal side has high error (red), and C-terminal side has low error (blue). (F) Superposition between the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP (from 260 to 566) and that of human protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain). The region in white in AtGTLP is the N-terminal region that was not included in the superposition. The gradation coloring scheme was employed from N-terminal to C-terminal side on the superposed region. Human O-fucosyltransferase 2 is colored in gray with GDP analogue in ball-and-stick model which suggests the active site of the protein. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone is 5.9 Å. The similarity of the location of α-helices can be noticed. Open in a new tabAnalysis of AtGTLP’s amino acid sequence using Phyre2 server (Kelley et al. 2015; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index, accessed Nov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between the C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.2% confidence), protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well as C. elegans protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% i.d., 98.9% confidence) and protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown in Figure 1F. Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database (Lu et al. 2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of ‘O-FUT-like’ domain in the C-terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as a query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature (Smith et al. 2018) were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as ‘GTnc’.AtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans-Golgi To investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP-tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP protein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures scattered within the cell (Figure 2). Figure 2. Subcellular localization of AtGTLP.

Scale bar=10 μm. White arrow heads in (F) close up-dots of ‘free’ tagRFP-VAMP727. Close-up scale bar=2 μm. Open in a new tabIn order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double-visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with various RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with trans-Golgi marker, ST (Boevink et al. 1998) was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs (Figure 3; PCC=0.5–0.91; median=0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to trans-Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk-like structures, patches of magenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those structures were also visible (Figure 2A, ‘close-up’). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that within trans-Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker (Figure 2B; Uemura et al. 2004), was analyzed (Figure 3; 0.21–0.83, median=0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP-mGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of a single disk-like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), for the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair a slight shift between those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B). Figure 3. Colocalization of AtGTLP with organelle markers. As a mean of assessing the degree of colocalization, for each marker line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP and organelle marker fused with RFP Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for 45 ROIs hand-drawn around clusters of dot-like structures. Three separate images were analyzed (15 ROIs/image) for each marker. Median is shown for each marker. Open in a new tabFigure 4.

Open in a new tabMoreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 (Figure 2C; Uemura et al. 2004) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D; Dettmer et al. 2006), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was close to zero (Figure 3; PCC=0.0–0.65; median=0.41 and PCC=−0.01–0.79; median=0.46, respectively). Side-view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show a similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks (Figure 4C, D). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43 (Uemura et al. 2004), we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure 2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values (Figure 3; −0.17–0.64, with median of 0.26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E). Taking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two transport pathway markers—VAMP721, a marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar transport (Shimizu and Uemura 2022)—were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure 2F, Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure 3; −0.48–0.48, median=0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G, Figure 3; PCC=0.01–0.7, median=0.42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair also show a pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP-SYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, ‘free’ dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP-mGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, arrowheads).atgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes According to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas; Klepikova et al. 2016), AtGTLP is expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds. In both mutant lines used in this study, T-DNA insertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP’s exon (Figure 5A). Although the results of RT-PCR confirmed that transcription of AtGTLP in both of the T-DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method (Figure 5B), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences between atgtlp-1 or atgtlp-2 single mutants and wild-type plants in 8-day-old and 11-day-old seedlings (Figure 5C, D). Figure 5. Characteristics of atgtlp-1 and atgtlp-2 single mutant lines.

Open in a new tabDiscussion Trans-Golgi localization of AtGTLP In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP colocalized well with the trans-Golgi marker, ST, as well as with the Golgi marker, GOS12. Based on these results, we consider AtGTLP to be a resident Golgi protein, localizing mainly to trans-Golgi. Furthermore, the ring-like appearance of AtGTLP-mGFP fluorescence suggest that it localizes mainly to the rim of Golgi cisternae (Tie et al. 2018). The results of this study showed that the predicted characteristics of AtGTLP match that of glycosyltransferases. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation processes are commonly thought to occur mainly in ER and Golgi (Hansen et al. 2010). In plants, biosynthesis of many cell wall polysaccharides, another process that involves GTs, was also reported to take place in Golgi (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al. 2004). Predicted topology model of AtGTLP suggests that it possesses a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail and a single transmembrane helix, while its globular functional domain is positioned inside the lumen. Such topology, often described as ‘type II topology’ in literature, is common among Golgi-resident enzymes known to take part in protein glycosylation processes (Banfield 2011; Hansen et al. 2010; Welch and Munro 2019). Our data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially colocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, and to a lesser extent, SYP43, in a portion of the analyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was close to 0, which suggests no colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is a vesicular-tubular compartment adjacent to the trans side of a Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be a distinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi (Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, existence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi-associated TGN (GA-TGN) and Golgi-independent TGN (free-TGN/GI-TGN)—a subpopulation of the TGN that is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has been reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008; Uemura et al. 2014; Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion (Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination (Keller and Simons 1997). In addition to TGN-resident SNAREs, involved in transport, other TGN-localized proteins include lipid-processing enzymes, which help to pack cargo proteins into transport vesicles (Gu et al. 2001). Glycosylation is a sequential process, in which different types of sugar are added to glycans in a specific order, as the modified macromolecule travels from ER through Golgi apparatus to finally reach the TGN. In mammalian cells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic acid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN-localized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995; Stanley 2011). In plants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase activity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we therefore propose that AtGTLP is a trans-Golgi-localized protein.AtGTLP—a novel fucosyltransferase? Analysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown that its C-terminal domain bears resemblance to the conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, although no obvious sequence similarity was found between AtGTLP and the proteins which have been previously classified as members of FUT family in Arabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence that would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we consider that this protein may potentially belong to a yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with either GT or FUT activity. One interesting possibility that is worth considering is that AtGTLP is indeed a POFUT. Phylogenetic analyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest plant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from POFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and POFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2019). Interestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis putative POFUT, O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface, was reported to diverge from this pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of AtOFT1 has shown that it exhibits a relatively high sequence identity to members of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative POFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). As in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be potentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility that yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more related to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported POFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further examinations. In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP localizes mainly to trans-Golgi. Human POFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and Haltiwanger 2005; Luo et al. 2006), where the O-glycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley 2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, SPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm (Bi et al. 2023; Kumar et al. 2023; Zentella et al. 2023). However, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with this subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other hand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 (Robichaux et al. 2023; Smith et al. 2018), as well as FRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 (Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to localize to Golgi. In addition, α1,3-fucosylation in sycamore cells, as well as α1,4-fucosylation by FUT13 in Arabidopsis was shown to occur mainly in trans-Golgi cisternae (Fitchette-Lainé et al. 1994; Schoberer et al. 2013), suggesting that fucose is available at plant Golgi to be used as a substrate. In relation to AtGTLP showing distant similarity to metazoan POFUTs, alternative possibility is that it may be a new type of plant fucosyltransferase. One type of macromolecules, which contain fucose are pectic polysaccharides—RG-I and RG-II. At present, biosynthesis of RG-I and RG-II is not fully understood, and no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked to synthesis of RG-I and RG-II side chains, has been identified (Soto et al. 2019; Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting that yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is present in plants and responsible for this process. GTs are a diverse family of enzymes and very few members of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been well-characterized thus far. Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as its trans-Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence of O-FUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions, atgtlp−/− single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col-0 plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows a very high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential candidate. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, as well as the biological role of AtGTLP.Acknowledgments We thank K.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.Conclusions We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, Microtubules",

    "methods": "Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the complemented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.8% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22 °C in the dark. Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [7, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 °C in long-day conditions (16 h light) on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 1.5% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days after which the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another 4 days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using a Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with a Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image J [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/L). Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyzamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for 5 days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing 7-day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm 3% low melting point agarose on a slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with a Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope. Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using a Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alternatively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in a working aqueous solution (10 μg/ml) of propidium iodide for 1 min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 s. The roots were mounted in water and visualized using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [7, 41] using ImageJ [38]. Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti-α- tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted 1:100, were used for immunolabeling of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as a secondary antibody, diluted 1:500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using a 40X (1.25 NA) or 63X (1.4 NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis.",
    "results": "Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (1.5% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seedlings allowed to grow for an additional 4 days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impenetrable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alternates between rightward and leftward corrective deviations resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [4, 7]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinusoidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-0) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for deviation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation (β) (Fig. 1c) [7, 39]. tno1 mutants had a higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d; P < 0.05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) (Fig. 1c) and is a sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. A positive Lx results in a positive HGI value, which then signifies a rightward deviation while a negative value suggests leftward deviation [39]. tno1 roots had a significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e; P < 0.05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an increased rightward deviation from the vertical.

Error bars indicate standard error. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test Skewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely understood, but has been proposed to be a result of the circumnutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or circular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [6, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes a spiraling of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. A lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause a twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage [9]. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward-skewing mutants usually display a dominant left-handed CFR [4, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed a marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have a vertical arrangement of cell files with a lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal imaging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed a distinctive left-handed CFR with a higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quantify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the longitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Fig. 2.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates, with at least 10 cell files from 5 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard error. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-test Skewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as MT alignment controls the direction of cellulose deposition [46, 47]. Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or leftward skewing, with a dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display a handedness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is complex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is localized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from a recent study in which a TGN-localized protein was shown to activate a kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [9, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, b). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from 0 μM to 0.2 μM taxol is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the WT and complemented line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of 0.2 μM taxol reveals a larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, e). The phenotype is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of a slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Fig. 3.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-test Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants The MT-destabilizing chemical propyzamide (PPD) also enhances rightward skewing in WT seedlings [9]. Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests a MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed a slight increase in rightward skew at 1 μM PPD and a marked increase at 3 μM PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, b). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was significantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c). The increase in skewing for the complemented lines was slightly higher than the WT, suggesting that the precise expression pattern of the TNO1 protein may be reflected in the extent of root skewing. While the TNO1 transgene in the complemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates with at least 10 cell files from 3 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard errorsWe hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with a reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal microscopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on 3 μM PPD reveals a twisting of WT and complemented epidermal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, e). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology. There were no measurable differences between the root growth rates of the WT, tno1 and complemented lines when grown in the presence or absence of PPD (not shown), and it is therefore unlikely that the difference in skewing is due to differences in growth rate. Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on 3 μM PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to a possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall deposition that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form normally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. Fig. 5.

Scale bar =100 μm. b Representative agarose imprints of the base of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls grown on solvent control or 3 μM PPD for 7 days, imaged with a macro zoom microscope. Scale bar =100 μmTo assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypocotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to PPD-treated WT and complemented seedlings (Fig. 5b). The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiralization of the cells observed in the treated WT and complemented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concentrations of PPD (such as 2 μM) has been reported to cause a decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has a more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1. The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually arranged in a transverse orientation to facilitate anisotropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of a MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed between angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have a change in the pitch of MT arrays associated with a corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrangements similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains a transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left-handed CFR [9, 54] while the mor1–1 mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays a left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for a change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to a right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on a slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quantitative analyses on collected images were performed utilizing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest a mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue line along the 0–180 degree axis) (Fig. 6b). To assess whether a difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mechanism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Fig. 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate a role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to induce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from a disordered state in the meristematic zone to a transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [4, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather a transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates a complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of a MT-associated protein such as a kinesin; as an example, a TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or a lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have a distinct CFR [54, 58, 59]. Moreover, CFR can still occur upon MT disruption with MT destabilizing agents such as oryzalin and PPD [53]. This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor involved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, including mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the anisotropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. A lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types compared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [9, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting a role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew despite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized Q-SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Proteomic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting a role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as a link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62–65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose synthase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66–68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose synthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CESTRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be crucial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1–1, any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibitors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that a cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mutants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reactions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose deposition patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifolia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division patterns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that individual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be a challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play a key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1’s role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stability and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1’s precise role will help in elucidation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered a role for a TGN-localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impenetrable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest a possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. A better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to information that can be used to manipulate root growth and development patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture. This could subsequently result in engineering superior crops with better soil penetration and nutrient assimilation traits.",

Copyright notice ID: 5387210 PMID: 28399805 Abstract Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.Conclusions We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, MicrotubulesBackground Establishment of the root system of a plant is crucial for efficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root development and architecture are well-studied [1] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [2, 3]. Root growth into the substratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expansion [4]. This leads to a cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture. Studying and simulating root movement and directional growth in the laboratory on synthetic growth media has revealed distinct movement types, and some of the genes and pathways that control them [4]. Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings display various growth behaviors depending on external conditions. When embedded in a homogeneous medium (penetrable agar), roots grow downward in response to gravity and show minimal deviation from the gravity vector. By contrast, when roots are subjected to multiple directional cues, complicated growth patterns occur [5]. For example, Arabidopsis roots grown on a slanted impenetrable medium (1.5% agar) show a characteristic deviation from the vertical (skewing) with a periodic wave-like pattern along their trajectory (waving). This arises due to a combination of touch [6], gravitropism [7], circumnutation [5], and physical interaction between the root tip and the growth medium [8]. Skewing and waving roots display a characteristic twisting of epidermal cell files along the root, referred to as cell file rotation (CFR). When roots of Arabidopsis seedlings skew and wave, the succession of sinusoidal waves alternate between left-handed and right-handed CFRs, which correlates with their rightward and leftward movement respectively [6, 7]. According to Rutherford and Masson (1996), skewing is described as rightward or leftward when viewed from the back of the plate [7] while handedness of the CFR is defined as left-handed or right-handed when viewing the axis of the root pointing shootwards. Roots of Arabidopsis grown on a slanted, hard medium exhibit a dominant left-handed rotation around the growth axis resulting in a predominantly counterclockwise/left-handed epidermal CFR. This usually corresponds to a rightward skewing when seen from the back of the plate [7, 9, 10]. CFR also typically correlates with an oblique microtubule (MT) array orientation in the twisting cell files, although exceptions do exist [11]. Multiple factors such as external cues (e.g. moisture, light or gravity), hormonal pathways, and cytoskeletal and cell wall dynamics influence the direction of root growth [4]. External cues signal changes in hormone signaling pathways, including auxin [12–14], ethylene [8, 15], cytokinin [16] and brassinosteroid pathways [17]. Downstream of hormonal and environmental perception, changes in the cytoskeleton and in cell wall deposition patterns modulate cell division and cell expansion dynamics, thus mediating root movements. Defects in tubulin structure or activity or in MT-associated proteins result in altered MT dynamics and array orientation. This then leads to changes in cell expansion and affects CFR and skewing [18, 19]. Cell wall properties and the trafficking of cell wall components to the plasma membrane are key to root elongation and movement as inferred from the altered root movements observed in mutants defective in cellulose deposition, wall-anchored proteins or crosslinking of cell wall components [20–22]. Sorting of cell wall components occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans- most cisternae of the Golgi [23]. It acts as an early endosome, receiving endocytosed cargo as well as directing vacuolar and secretory traffic, with distinct subdomains that function in various trafficking routes [24–30]. Specific membrane fusion factors called SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) maintain vesicle trafficking fidelity and cargo sorting within cells [31]. The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family is required for multiple transport pathways that in turn regulate auxin homeostasis and disease resistance [30]. SYP61, another TGN-localized SNARE that interacts with SYP41, functions in vacuolar trafficking and secretion of cell wall enzymes such as cellulose synthase and pectin-polysaccharide-modifying protein. This indicates a role for SYP61 in trafficking of cell wall components and enzymes for their synthesis and modification [32–34]. TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein) is a TGN-localized coiled-coil protein that interacts with the SYP41 SNARE machinery. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 (tno1) partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo, mis-localize SYP61 and display altered TGN dynamics and slower gravitropic responses [35, 36]. Trafficking at the TGN plays a role in auxin responses, trafficking of cell wall components, and cell expansion, all of which are important for root growth and movement. In addition, gravitropic bending is delayed in tno1 roots, suggesting defects in directional growth of roots. We therefore investigated a potential function for TNO1 in root movement. We report here that TNO1 acts as a negative regulator of root skewing, since tno1 mutant roots have enhanced skewing which also correlates with an enhanced CFR.Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the complemented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.8% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22 °C in the dark.Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [7, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 °C in long-day conditions (16 h light) on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 1.5% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days after which the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another 4 days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using a Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with a Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image J [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/L).Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyzamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for 5 days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing 7-day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm 3% low melting point agarose on a slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with a Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope.Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using a Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alternatively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in a working aqueous solution (10 μg/ml) of propidium iodide for 1 min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 s. The roots were mounted in water and visualized using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [7, 41] using ImageJ [38].Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti-α- tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted 1:100, were used for immunolabeling of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as a secondary antibody, diluted 1:500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using a 40X (1.25 NA) or 63X (1.4 NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis.Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (1.5% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seedlings allowed to grow for an additional 4 days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impenetrable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alternates between rightward and leftward corrective deviations resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [4, 7]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinusoidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-0) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for deviation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation (β) (Fig. 1c) [7, 39]. tno1 mutants had a higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d; P < 0.05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) (Fig. 1c) and is a sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. A positive Lx results in a positive HGI value, which then signifies a rightward deviation while a negative value suggests leftward deviation [39]. tno1 roots had a significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e; P < 0.05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an increased rightward deviation from the vertical.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-testSkewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely understood, but has been proposed to be a result of the circumnutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or circular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [6, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes a spiraling of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. A lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause a twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage [9]. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward-skewing mutants usually display a dominant left-handed CFR [4, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed a marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have a vertical arrangement of cell files with a lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal imaging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed a distinctive left-handed CFR with a higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quantify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the longitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Fig. 2.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-testSkewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as MT alignment controls the direction of cellulose deposition [46, 47]. Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or leftward skewing, with a dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display a handedness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is complex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is localized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from a recent study in which a TGN-localized protein was shown to activate a kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [9, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, b). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from 0 μM to 0.2 μM taxol is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the WT and complemented line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of 0.2 μM taxol reveals a larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, e). The phenotype is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of a slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Fig. 3.

Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests a MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed a slight increase in rightward skew at 1 μM PPD and a marked increase at 3 μM PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, b). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was significantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c). The increase in skewing for the complemented lines was slightly higher than the WT, suggesting that the precise expression pattern of the TNO1 protein may be reflected in the extent of root skewing. While the TNO1 transgene in the complemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates with at least 10 cell files from 3 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard errorsWe hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with a reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal microscopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on 3 μM PPD reveals a twisting of WT and complemented epidermal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, e). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology. There were no measurable differences between the root growth rates of the WT, tno1 and complemented lines when grown in the presence or absence of PPD (not shown), and it is therefore unlikely that the difference in skewing is due to differences in growth rate. Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on 3 μM PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to a possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall deposition that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form normally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. Fig. 5.

Scale bar =100 μm. b Representative agarose imprints of the base of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls grown on solvent control or 3 μM PPD for 7 days, imaged with a macro zoom microscope. Scale bar =100 μmTo assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypocotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to PPD-treated WT and complemented seedlings (Fig. 5b). The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiralization of the cells observed in the treated WT and complemented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concentrations of PPD (such as 2 μM) has been reported to cause a decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has a more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1.The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually arranged in a transverse orientation to facilitate anisotropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of a MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed between angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have a change in the pitch of MT arrays associated with a corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrangements similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains a transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left-handed CFR [9, 54] while the mor1–1 mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays a left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for a change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to a right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on a slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quantitative analyses on collected images were performed utilizing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest a mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue line along the 0–180 degree axis) (Fig. 6b). To assess whether a difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mechanism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Fig. 6.

Error bars indicate standard errorsDiscussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate a role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to induce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from a disordered state in the meristematic zone to a transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [4, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather a transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates a complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of a MT-associated protein such as a kinesin; as an example, a TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or a lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have a distinct CFR [54, 58, 59]. Moreover, CFR can still occur upon MT disruption with MT destabilizing agents such as oryzalin and PPD [53]. This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor involved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, including mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the anisotropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. A lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types compared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [9, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting a role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew despite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized Q-SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Proteomic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting a role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as a link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62–65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose synthase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66–68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose synthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CESTRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be crucial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1–1, any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibitors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that a cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mutants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reactions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose deposition patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifolia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division patterns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that individual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be a challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play a key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1’s role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stability and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1’s precise role will help in elucidation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis.Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered a role for a TGN-localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impenetrable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest a possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. A better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to information that can be used to manipulate root growth and development patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture. This could subsequently result in engineering superior crops with better soil penetration and nutrient assimilation traits.Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Patrick Masson and Dr. Kate Baldwin for advice on the skewing assays, Colton McNinch and Dr. Xiaochen Yang for technical help and advice, Dr. Bin Dong and Jennifer Johnson for assistance with the MFA software, Margaret Carter for guidance on confocal imaging and Dr. Divita Mathur for conceptual insights.

    "abstract": "Abstract The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins. Keywords: auxin, trans-Golgi network, lateral root, gravitropism, tethering factor",
    "introduction": "Introduction The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack (Staehelin and Kang, 2008; Kang, 2011; Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains for various trafficking routes (Bassham et al., 2000; Chow et al., 2008; Gendre et al., 2011). The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010) that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004; Robatzek et al., 2006; Dhonukshe et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in trafficking of biosynthetic traffic to the vacuole (Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and Jurgens, 2011; Reyes et al., 2011; Contento and Bassham, 2012). High transport fidelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle trafficking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classified as target SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al., 1998). The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of a tetrameric trans-SNARE complex (McNew et al., 2000; Lipka et al., 2007; Kim and Brandizzi, 2012; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012; Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation (Cai et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular trafficking efficiency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Chia and Gleeson, 2011; Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al., 2007; Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled-coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation of trafficking steps in the cell also requires a family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream effectors (Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab effectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007; Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Hong and Lev, 2014). Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, with different localizations reflecting their specialized roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000; Uemura et al., 2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar trafficking (Uemura et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct traffic to the plasma membrane (Drakakaki et al., 2012), with a role in mediating stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identified as a SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased trafficking fidelity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011). SYP42 and SYP43 play a role in root gravitropism, most likely via regulation of the localization of the auxin eﬄux transporters PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012). Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin influx transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Rakusová et al., 2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus affect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein trafficking and auxin transporters, we investigated auxin responses in the tno1 mutant during root development. Loss of TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally, tno1 roots failed to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin response marker DR5rev:GFP at the LR tips as well as after gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root development and response to gravity.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions The A. thaliana seed stocks used in this study have been previously described: Col-0 (wild-type, WT), tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503; Kim and Bassham, 2011), complemented tno1 mutant (Kim and Bassham, 2011), and DR5rev:GFP (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 days. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22°C in long-day conditions (16 h light) in soil or on 0.25× or 0.5× solid Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (MS vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.6% (w/v) phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Gravitropism Assays The hypocotyl gravitropism assay was modified from Stanga et al. (2009). Seeds were plated on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 1% sucrose in square plates and kept vertically oriented in the dark. After 5 days, the plates were rotated 90° for gravistimulation. Pictures were acquired using a Canon Rebel XTS camera in a dark room with a green filter over the flash to prevent phototropic curvature of the hypocotyl toward the camera flash. Zero-hour images of each seedling were compared to later time point images of the same seedling using Image J (Schneider et al., 2012) to determine bending angles. For root gravitropic assays, sterilized seeds were mixed with molten growth medium just before solidification and poured into square plates (Stanga et al., 2009). After 5 days of vertical growth the seedlings were gravistimulated by rotating the plate by 90°. Pictures were taken 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation and analyzed using Image J to assess gravitropic curvature. For root and hypocotyl gravitropic rescue assays, the roots of 5-day-old vertically grown seedlings were overlaid with media containing either 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (1-NAA; Sigma–Aldrich, N0640), 30 nM 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA; Sigma–Aldrich, I2886), or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; Gibco, 11215), followed by gravistimulation. Pictures of roots and hypocotyls after 12 h were compared to 0-h images using Image J. For all assays, at least three biological replicates were performed, with 15–20 seedlings per replicate. LR Density Analysis To determine the density of emerging LRs, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on 0.25× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 1% sucrose and grown vertically. After 10 days, the number of LRs emerging from the primary root were counted and divided by the root length to obtain LR density. For determination of LR primordia density, 7-day-old roots were cleared with 2.5% bleach for 10 min and visualized with an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. To assess rescue of LR emergence, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM 1-NAA or 1 μM IAA in the dark (to prevent photo-degradation). After 5 additional days, the number of emergent LRs was scored. For each analysis, three independent biological replicates were performed with 15–20 seedlings per replicate. Root Length Inhibition Assays Seedlings were grown on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with 1% sucrose for 5 days. They were then transferred to media containing either 2,4-D, IAA, 1-NAA, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; Naptalam, Sigma–Aldrich, 33371), 1-napthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA; Sigma–Aldrich, 255416) at the concentrations indicated, or solvent controls [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol], and the position of the root tip was marked. Each plate contained all three genotypes (WT, tno1 mutant, and complemented lines) to compensate for possible effects of inter-plate variation. After 6 days, pictures were acquired and the length from the marked root tip position was measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Root elongation in the presence of the tested chemicals was compared with solvent controls and expressed as percent decrease in root length. At least three biological replicates with a minimum of 20 seedlings per replicate were conducted for each treatment. Analysis of Auxin Response Distribution tno1 plants expressing DR5rev:GFP were generated by crossing tno1 (Kim and Bassham, 2011) with DR5rev:GFP lines (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Homozygous tno1 plants carrying the DR5rev:GFP transgene were selected in subsequent generations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping as previously described (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence visualization. For analysis of auxin redistribution, control and tno1 roots expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated and visualized with a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility. A 40× oil immersion objective lens was used along with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP visualization. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both mutant and WT roots with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed. GFP asymmetry was quantified using Image J by subjecting the confocal images to similar thresholding and post-processing. Equal volume boxes were drawn on the upper and lower flanks and total pixel intensity from the lower vs. upper box was expressed as a ratio. To analyze DR5rev:GFP expression in LRs, a total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six different seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy for each genotype. The number of root tips showing asymmetry of GFP expression was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total observed. FM4-64 Staining and Brefeldin A (BFA) Treatment FM4-64 staining was modified from Dettmer et al. (2006). To test bulk endocytosis, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and subsequently washed twice for 30 s each time in 0.5× MS liquid medium before microscopic analysis. For analyzing arrival of FM4-64 at Brefeldin A bodies, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 35 μM Brefeldin A (BFA) for an hour followed by a 10-min treatment with 4 μM FM4-64 plus 35 μM BFA and two subsequent washes of 30 s each. The root tips were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility, using a 63× oil immersion objective lens and excitation and emission wavelengths of 558 and 734 nm. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both genotypes with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed for each treatment and genotype.",
    "results": "Results TNO1 Mediates LR Emergence in an Auxin-dependent Manner Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997). The SYP4 family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin transport (Uemura et al., 2012), hence we tested whether the SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of growth on 0.25× MS medium (Dubrovsky and Forde, 2012). Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its native promoter, termed complemented lines (Kim and Bassham, 2011), were similar to WT seedlings (Figures 1A,B). Since the major source of auxin in the root in the first 10 days after germination is transport from the leaves (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ljung et al., 2001), one possible reason for this defect may be that auxin flux is reduced in tno1, leading to suboptimal auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To confirm that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines (Figure 1C), suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1. FIGURE 1.

(B) Emergent lateral root density of 10-day-old seedlings grown on 0.25× Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (with 1% sucrose) was calculated by dividing the number of emerging lateral roots by root length. (C) Lateral root primordia density of 7-day-old seedlings was calculated by counting the number of primordia after microscopic analysis of cleared roots and dividing it by the root length. (D) Emergent LR density of 10-day-old seedlings, 5 days after transfer to medium containing 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) or 1 μM indoleacetic acid (IAA). All values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 15–20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test.The lipophilic auxin 1-NAA has been shown to rescue LR defects in the auxin transport mutant aux1 (Marchant et al., 2002). Natural auxin (IAA) treatment also rescues LR emergence in dark conditions (Reed et al., 1998). To test whether the emergence defect may be due to defects in auxin transport and hence reduced root auxin levels, LR emergence in the presence of 1-NAA (Murashige and Skoog, 1962; Marchant et al., 2002) or IAA in the dark (Reed et al., 1998) was assessed. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM NAA or 1 μM IAA, and LR density was analyzed after 5 days of growth. The LR density of tno1 resembled that of WT and complemented lines in the presence of either auxin (Figure 1D), indicating that exogenous auxins can rescue the emergent LR defect in tno1 roots. Therefore, TNO1 influences the temporal control of LR emergence from the primary root. TNO1 is Required for Gravitropic Bending We further examined a possible role for TNO1 in plant auxin responses by investigating gravitropism. Gravitropism involves the bending of a plant organ in response to its change in orientation with respect to gravity (gravistimulation). Gravitropic bending of organs upon gravistimulation is aided by a readjustment of auxin flow. Since a number of proteins involved in gravitropic curvature are recycled and trafficked via the TGN (Strohm et al., 2012), this organelle is critical for regulating downstream events that influence gravitropic plant organ bending. We, therefore, hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might affect dynamics at the TGN and thus lead to a change in the gravitropic bending response. To test this hypothesis, the gravitropic response of WT and tno1 mutant hypocotyls and roots was assessed. The tno1 mutant hypocotyls (Figure 2A) and roots (Figure 2B) showed delayed bending, and the angle of curvature at different time points was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of WT or complemented seedlings. This suggests that the loss of TNO1 causes a delay in the gravitropic bending of Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. Mutant roots and hypocotyls have a similar length to WT under normal growth conditions (Kim and Bassham, 2011), suggesting that the defect in gravitropism is not due to defective growth. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab TNO1 mediates gravitropic bending by an auxin dependent mechanism. (A) Hypocotyl bending of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls after gravistimulation. Dark-grown 5-day-old hypocotyls were gravistimulated in the dark and curvatures were calculated at 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation.

Light-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and then gravistimulated. Root curvatures were calculated after 12 h. (D) Some exogenous auxins can rescue the gravitropic bending defect in tno1 hypocotyls. Roots of dark-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-D, followed by gravistimulation. Hypocotyl curvatures were calculated after 12 h. All values represent the means of three biological replicates with at least 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors. Similar letters indicate no statistical difference while different letters indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test.The gravitropic bending response requires a reprogramming of auxin flow inside the shoot and root (Tanaka et al., 2006; Strohm et al., 2012), raising the possibility that the slower bending rate observed in tno1 could be due to changes in auxin flow. We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype in tno1 mutants is due to defect(s) in auxin transport, it may be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeable auxin 1-NAA, which has been previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in mutants defective in auxin transport (Marchant et al., 1999), the natural auxin IAA, and the influx-specific auxin 2,4-D. Following auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from the bending angles of the WT and complemented lines (Figure 2C), indicating rescue of the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The 2,4-D treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has been previously reported (Surpin et al., 2005) but there were no significant differences between WT and mutant. Similarly, hypocotyl bending was also rescued after a 12-h treatment with either IAA or 1-NAA (Figure 2D), confirming that the gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin-related defects. 2,4-D did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles significantly lower than WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating an effect of 2,4-D on gravitropism in roots but not in hypocotyls (Surpin et al., 2005). The tno1 mutant defects in gravitropic bending, therefore, may be due to defects in auxin transport or response. tno1 Roots Show Increased Sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA Auxin flux into plant cells is facilitated by influx carriers such as AUX1 and the LAX family of transporters, while exit from the cell involves eﬄux carriers belonging to the PIN and PGP families (Peer et al., 2011). Auxin analogs and transport inhibitors are important tools to uncover defects in auxin transport pathways. The auxin analog 2,4-D is an influx-specific substrate while 1-NAA is an eﬄux-specific substrate (Delbarre et al., 1996). The auxin transport inhibitor NPA interferes with auxin eﬄux while 1-NOA interferes with auxin influx and inhibits AUX1 (Thomson et al., 1973; Sussman and Goldsmith, 1981; Yang et al., 2006). To determine the effect of these inhibitors on the tno1 mutant, their effects on root growth were assessed. We found that tno1 roots were significantly (P < 0.05) more sensitive to 30 nM 2,4-D than WT or complemented roots (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with our observation of the failure of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic defect of mutant hypocotyls. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab tno1 roots show increased sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to media with the indicated chemical or solvent as a control and root length was calculated after an additional 6 days of growth. Mean root growth of each genotype on the chemical treatment compared to the mean on the solvent control was expressed as percentage inhibition. Percent inhibition of root length on (A) 30 nM 2,4-D, (B) 1-1-napthoxyacetic acid (NOA; 30, 50, and 70 μM), (C) 30 nM 2,4-D + 10 μM 1-NOA, (D) 40 nM IAA, (E) 100 nM 1-NAA, and (F) 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; 5 and 10 μM) for WT, KO, and COM lines are shown. Values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors derived from means of the three replicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) by a Student’s t-test.One possible explanation for this sensitivity is that influx routes are altered in the tno1 mutant, which led us to test the effect of blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA. Mutant roots showed similar sensitivity to WT and complemented lines across a range of concentrations of 1-NOA (Figure 3B), suggesting that blocking auxin influx affects the tno1 mutant to the same extent as wild-type. 1-NOA has a characteristic protective effect against root growth inhibition by 2,4-D (Parry et al., 2001); we, therefore, tested whether 1-NOA could rescue the root growth inhibition of mutant roots by 2,4-D to comparable levels as in the WT and complemented lines. Seedlings were transferred to medium containing 30 nM 2,4-D and 10 μM 1-NOA. The WT and complemented lines showed a significantly lower inhibition of root length than the mutants (P < 0.05), indicating that when auxin influx is blocked, tno1 mutants still have enhanced sensitivity to 2,4-D (Figure 3C). To determine whether the sensitivity to 2,4-D is also seen with other auxins, root growth inhibition on 40 nM IAA in the dark was assessed. tno1 mutant roots are indeed more sensitive to IAA (P < 0.05) than WT or complemented lines (Figure 3D). By contrast, treatment with 0.1 μM of the membrane-permeable NAA inhibited the growth of tno1 to a similar extent as WT and complemented plants (Figure 3E). Since 2,4-D and IAA are influx-specific substrates and NAA is not, the results are consistent with a possible defect in auxin influx pathways in tno1. tno1, WT, and complemented plants had similar responses to NPA treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that the auxin eﬄux pathway is unaffected in tno1. TNO1 Helps Mediate Auxin Responses during LR Elongation Lateral roots emerge perpendicular to the primary root and gradually start bending rootwards. Recently emerged LRs, which lack an elongation zone (stage I LR) gradually transition into stage II LRs, defined by an elongation zone and asymmetric growth of the upper and lower epidermal cell files (Rosquete et al., 2013). The differential growth peaks in the stage II LRs are due to asymmetric auxin distribution, which in turn is dependent on auxin transport mechanisms. Stage II LRs are thus defined by a characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response, which results in differential cellular elongation and downward root growth. This asymmetric auxin flux at the LR tip is caused by the specific activity and distribution of auxin transporters (Rosquete et al., 2013). The asymmetric auxin distribution pattern diminishes significantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and begin growing parallel to the primary root. It was reported that on average more than 75% of stage II LRs in WT plants display asymmetric distribution of auxin responses at LR tips (Rosquete et al., 2013), visualized by the pattern of DR5rev:GFP expression (Friml et al., 2003). Since TNO1 is linked to LR emergence by a possible auxin-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that asymmetric auxin transport or response is defective in tno1 LRs. Hence, the percentage of LRs showing asymmetric auxin responses in stage II tno1 LR tips would be lower compared to WT (or complemented) root tips. To test this, the percentage of stage II LRs with auxin response asymmetry in WT and tno1 background lines expressing DR5rev:GFP was determined by confocal microscopy. 40% of tno1 stage II LRs displayed auxin asymmetry at the LR tip compared to 80% in WT stage II LRs (Figures 4A,B). Thus, tno1 roots are defective in establishing the correct pattern of auxin response during LR development. This defect could explain the lower emergent LR density observed in tno1 compared to WT, since a disruption of auxin flow or establishment of asymmetry would prevent LR emergence. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab TNO1 helps mediate auxin response asymmetry at lateral root (LR) tips. (A) Representative confocal images of stage II LR tips of WT and tno1 expressing the auxin-responsive DR5rev:GFP reporter. Yellow arrowheads indicate asymmetry of the auxin reporter GFP expression. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) The percentage of stage II LRs displaying an asymmetric auxin response pattern. A total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six seedlings were analyzed. TNO1 Facilitates Shootward Auxin Response during Root Bending Normally, gravitropic bending of the primary root leads to an eventual return of the root tip toward the gravity vector. This occurs via a cascade of signals leading to asymmetric auxin flow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and cortical cells (moving toward the root–shoot junction). During this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending (Ottenschlager et al., 2003; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010; Baldwin et al., 2012). Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending (Figure 2) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs (Figure 4), we hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to a decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation zone. To test this hypothesis, vertical plate-grown WT and tno1 seedlings expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated by rotating the plates by 90°. Confocal images were acquired before gravistimulation and subsequently at 5, 8, and 12 h after gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips (Figures 5A–D). In the WT background, GFP fluorescence progressed shootward from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward appearance of fluorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5B–D). The difference in GFP fluorescence intensity on the upper and lower flanks was expressed as a ratio for each genotype at different time points. This ratio was significantly higher for WT roots than for tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting a stronger response in WT than in the mutants (Figure 5E). This in turn implies that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be due to a decrease in auxin transport, or a difference in auxin response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such a defect could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by a similar mechanism (Rosquete et al., 2013), this could also explain the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response asymmetry in tno1. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab tno1 mutants have delayed auxin responses in epidermal cells in gravistimulated roots.

(E) Quantification of DR5rev:GFP asymmetry as a ratio of fluorescence intensity on the lower and upper flanks of gravistimulated roots at the indicated time points. Values are means from analysis of 10 roots for each time point and error bars indicate standard errors. Similar letters indicate no statistical difference while different letters indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test. TNO1 is not Required for Bulk Endocytosis Auxin transporters such as the PIN proteins are continuously endocytosed to the TGN and recycled back to the plasma membrane to maintain an appropriate density, thus allowing steady auxin flux through plant cells (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Friml, 2010). Defects in endocytosis and components involved in the endocytic route to the TGN can, therefore, cause a defect in auxin transport pathways. Since tno1 mutants show defects in TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo at the TGN. This in turn would manifest in altered auxin transporter trafficking dynamics, and subsequently alter auxin responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed endocytosis in root epidermal cells using the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64, which is endocytosed and labels early endosomes. To capture early endocytic events, roots of 4-day-old seedlings were stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and then washed twice for 30 s each time in MS medium. Both WT and tno1 root cells showed similar endosome labeling patterns (Figure 6A, yellow arrowheads), suggesting that bulk endocytic uptake is normal in tno1 roots. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab tno1 mutants have normal bulk endocytosis and arrival of membrane cargo from plasma membrane to Brefeldin A (BFA) bodies. (A) Root cells showing uptake of FM4-64 after 2 min of treatment of 4-day-old seedlings with 4 μM FM4-64 in liquid 0.5× MS medium. Yellow arrowheads indicate early endosomes/TGN. (B) Root cells treated with 35 μM BFA for 1 h, followed by a 10 min incubation with 4 μM FM4-64, showing arrival of FM4-64 at BFA bodies. White arrowheads indicate BFA bodies.To confirm that bulk endocytosis was unaffected and that endocytic vesicles are delivered normally to the TGN in the mutant, the incorporation of FM4-64 into BFA bodies was assessed. The fungal toxin BFA causes aggregation of the TGN and TGN-derived endosomes to form BFA bodies (Geldner et al., 2001; Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2009). BFA body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants (Kim and Bassham, 2011). It was hypothesized that if tno1 has defects in the delivery of endocytosed material to the TGN, then FM4-64 labeling of BFA bodies in tno1 roots would be reduced compared with WT roots. To test this hypothesis, 5-day-old WT and mutant seedlings were incubated with 35 μM BFA for an hour to allow formation of BFA bodies. They were then stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 10 min in the presence of BFA, followed by two washes in MS medium containing BFA. The BFA bodies in both WT and tno1 roots showed normal FM4-64 staining (Figure 6B, white arrowheads) after 10 min. Thus, loss of TNO1 does not affect bulk endocytosis and membrane flow from the plasma membrane to the TGN in root cells.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Auxin flow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the specific localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular trafficking machinery. The TGN is an important organelle controlling vesicle trafficking, with the presence of multiple proteins that aid the trafficking of cargoes such as auxin transporters. In this study we have demonstrated a role for a putative tethering factor localized at the TGN in efficient gravitropic bending and LR emergence, possibly by affecting auxin transport. TNO1 may Regulate Gravitropic Responses through Trafficking of Auxin Transporters Auxin flows in a polar manner from the shoot to the root tip, via the vasculature, and then back through the cortical and epidermal cell layers shootward. This polar transport is dependent on the polar localization of auxin transporters to plasma membranes, via trafficking pathways that achieve correct subcellular distribution (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). Auxin transporters undergo endocytic recycling from the plasma membrane as well as being targeted to new plasma membrane domains via the TGN (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). This enables a plant to respond to environmental cues and adjust its growth pattern accordingly. For example, during the bending of roots upon gravistimulation, an accumulation of auxin in the epidermal layer of the elongation zone in the lower half of the root is required to facilitate the bending process (Tanaka et al., 2006; Peer et al., 2011). This occurs by the relocalization of auxin transporters, AUX1 in the columella and lateral rootcap and AUX1 and PIN2 in the epidermal cells (Strohm et al., 2012). The resulting readjustment of auxin flow from the columella via the lateral rootcap cell to the epidermal cells in the root elongation zone leads to differential growth (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Since tno1 has defects in intracellular trafficking and TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011), we hypothesize that these may hinder auxin transport pathways due to change(s) in trafficking of auxin transporter(s). Phenotypic characterization of gravitropic responses in tno1 roots and hypocotyls showed that these mutants have a decreased angle of bending upon gravistimulation. Pharmacological studies with auxin transport inhibitors and exogenous auxin analogs suggest that altered auxin pathways are likely to be the underlying cause of this defect. The gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application of 1-NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin responses. Growth of tno1 roots is hypersensitive to 2,4-D and IAA but not to the eﬄux-specific substrate 1-NAA or the eﬄux blocker NPA, raising the possibility that the auxin influx pathway might be defective while auxin eﬄux is normal. Although blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA does not result in large differences in root elongation between the tno1 mutant and WT, the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the presence of 1-NOA is still higher for the tno1 mutant roots than the WT and complemented lines. This, coupled with the inability of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic bending defect of mutant hypocotyls, may suggest altered responses to the influx-specific substrate 2,4-D. Additionally, the delayed progression of DR5rev:GFP expression in epidermal cells of gravistimulated tno1 roots compared to WT roots suggests that auxin flow from the columella to the epidermis (via the lateral rootcap cells) may be reduced in tno1 roots. Based on these results, we hypothesize that altered auxin influx capacity underlies the gravitropic defects in tno1. Given the role of TNO1, this could occur through altered trafficking of auxin influx carrier(s). However, it is also possible that the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the tno1 mutant is due to differences in auxin signaling, feedback or response, since it is known that the auxin sensing mechanism is complex and varies for different kinds of auxins (Calderón Villalobos et al., 2012). Since auxin transporters are trafficked via endocytosis (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008), we hypothesized that TNO1 may affect endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the TGN/early endosomes and hence alter transporter trafficking dynamics. Bulk uptake and arrival of a general endocytosis marker at the TGN was unaffected in the tno1 mutant and thus the auxin-related defects do not appear to be due to defects in bulk endocytosis. However, it is possible that TNO1 is required for the polar targeting of a particular subset of auxin transporter(s), either as they are newly synthesized or during the recycling process for membrane relocalization. Further detailed characterization of the behavior of such proteins in tno1 cells will help distinguish between these hypotheses. The polar sorting of auxin transporters in plant cells is highly complex and our understanding of how the SNARE machinery might regulate this polarity is incomplete. Vacuolar SNAREs have been shown to play a role in maintaining auxin maxima and localization of the auxin eﬄux carrier PIN1 in the leaf primordium, thereby regulating leaf vasculature (Shirakawa et al., 2009). The SYP4 family of Qa SNAREs affects auxin distribution, root gravitropism, and the intracellular trafficking of the PIN2 transporter to the vacuole for degradation (Uemura et al., 2012). Since TNO1 associates with the SNARE machinery at the TGN, and its loss causes a mis-localization of SYP61 as well as vacuolar sorting defects (Kim and Bassham, 2011), the SYP41/SYP61/VTI12 complex in conjunction with TNO1 may regulate auxin transport by affecting auxin transporter trafficking and turnover. TNO1 Contributes to the Temporal Control of LR Emergence We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in LR emergence and generation of auxin response asymmetry in an emerging LR. LR development begins by division of LR founder cells (single or pairs of pericycle cells facing the xylem poles) in the primary root and subsequent formation of an auxin maximum and increased auxin responsiveness of the founder cells (De Smet et al., 2007; Dubrovsky et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2009). Auxin transport plays a crucial role in LR emergence, with both auxin influx and eﬄux carriers being involved. The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is important for loading auxin into the vascular system (Marchant et al., 2002) and aux1 mutants have an almost 50% reduction in LR number. Auxin in the endodermis and cortical cells induces another auxin influx carrier, LAX3, which also facilitates LR emergence (Swarup et al., 2008). The concerted action of AUX1 and LAX3, with subsequent induction of expression of PIN3 in the cortex, leads to emergence of the LR from the primary root (Swarup and Peret, 2012; Peret et al., 2013). The LR emergence defects observed in tno1 are consistent with altered auxin transport due to disruption in the trafficking or targeting of auxin transporters. tno1 mutants have a significantly reduced percentage (40% vs. 80% in WT) of emergent Stage II LRs with asymmetric DR5rev:GFP expression, raising the possibility of auxin transport defect(s). Since the action of PIN transporters plays a crucial role in establishing this asymmetric pattern of auxin activity in emergent LRs (Rosquete et al., 2013), TNO1 might affect the trafficking of PIN transporters in the LR tip cells during this process. LR emergence occurs within the pericycle and involves degradation of the pectin-rich middle lamella, with subsequent cell separation to allow growth of the LR through multiple cell layers (Vilches-Barro and Maizel, 2014). Focused auxin flow via transporters into the cortex and the epidermis causes an induction of expression of cell wall remodeling enzymes (Swarup et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2013). Secretory cargo, including various cell wall remodeling enzymes, traffics via the Golgi and TGN toward the extracellular space (Foresti and Denecke, 2008; Toyooka et al., 2009; De Caroli et al., 2011), in a pathway potentially mediated by SYP61 (Drakakaki et al., 2012). Hence, it is possible that defects in the TGN, including the mis-localization of SYP61 seen in tno1, could also lead to disrupted secretion of cell wall remodeling enzymes, thus leading to slower LR emergence (Worden et al., 2012). The identification of effectors directly associated with TNO1 may help elucidate its mechanism of action during these auxin-mediated processes. Since tethering factors can interact with Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007), TNO1 could potentially indirectly affect auxin transporter sorting by affecting the Rab cycle or the function of Rab effectors. Selective targeting of auxin transporters between the plasma membrane and the TGN could be defective in tno1 independent of the constitutive pathways that constantly recycle them between these membranes. Turnover of auxin transporters could also be reduced due to defective targeting to the vacuole for degradation.

Copyright notice ID: 4642138 PMID: 26617617 Abstract The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins. Keywords: auxin, trans-Golgi network, lateral root, gravitropism, tethering factorIntroduction The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack (Staehelin and Kang, 2008; Kang, 2011; Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains for various trafficking routes (Bassham et al., 2000; Chow et al., 2008; Gendre et al., 2011). The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010) that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004; Robatzek et al., 2006; Dhonukshe et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in trafficking of biosynthetic traffic to the vacuole (Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and Jurgens, 2011; Reyes et al., 2011; Contento and Bassham, 2012). High transport fidelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle trafficking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classified as target SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al., 1998). The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of a tetrameric trans-SNARE complex (McNew et al., 2000; Lipka et al., 2007; Kim and Brandizzi, 2012; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012; Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation (Cai et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular trafficking efficiency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Chia and Gleeson, 2011; Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al., 2007; Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled-coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation of trafficking steps in the cell also requires a family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream effectors (Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab effectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007; Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Hong and Lev, 2014). Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, with different localizations reflecting their specialized roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000; Uemura et al., 2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar trafficking (Uemura et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct traffic to the plasma membrane (Drakakaki et al., 2012), with a role in mediating stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identified as a SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased trafficking fidelity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011). SYP42 and SYP43 play a role in root gravitropism, most likely via regulation of the localization of the auxin eﬄux transporters PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012). Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin influx transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Rakusová et al., 2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus affect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein trafficking and auxin transporters, we investigated auxin responses in the tno1 mutant during root development. Loss of TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally, tno1 roots failed to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin response marker DR5rev:GFP at the LR tips as well as after gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root development and response to gravity.Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions The A. thaliana seed stocks used in this study have been previously described: Col-0 (wild-type, WT), tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503; Kim and Bassham, 2011), complemented tno1 mutant (Kim and Bassham, 2011), and DR5rev:GFP (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 days. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22°C in long-day conditions (16 h light) in soil or on 0.25× or 0.5× solid Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (MS vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.6% (w/v) phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01).Gravitropism Assays The hypocotyl gravitropism assay was modified from Stanga et al. (2009). Seeds were plated on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 1% sucrose in square plates and kept vertically oriented in the dark. After 5 days, the plates were rotated 90° for gravistimulation. Pictures were acquired using a Canon Rebel XTS camera in a dark room with a green filter over the flash to prevent phototropic curvature of the hypocotyl toward the camera flash. Zero-hour images of each seedling were compared to later time point images of the same seedling using Image J (Schneider et al., 2012) to determine bending angles. For root gravitropic assays, sterilized seeds were mixed with molten growth medium just before solidification and poured into square plates (Stanga et al., 2009). After 5 days of vertical growth the seedlings were gravistimulated by rotating the plate by 90°. Pictures were taken 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation and analyzed using Image J to assess gravitropic curvature. For root and hypocotyl gravitropic rescue assays, the roots of 5-day-old vertically grown seedlings were overlaid with media containing either 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (1-NAA; Sigma–Aldrich, N0640), 30 nM 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA; Sigma–Aldrich, I2886), or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; Gibco, 11215), followed by gravistimulation. Pictures of roots and hypocotyls after 12 h were compared to 0-h images using Image J. For all assays, at least three biological replicates were performed, with 15–20 seedlings per replicate.LR Density Analysis To determine the density of emerging LRs, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on 0.25× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 1% sucrose and grown vertically. After 10 days, the number of LRs emerging from the primary root were counted and divided by the root length to obtain LR density. For determination of LR primordia density, 7-day-old roots were cleared with 2.5% bleach for 10 min and visualized with an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. To assess rescue of LR emergence, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM 1-NAA or 1 μM IAA in the dark (to prevent photo-degradation). After 5 additional days, the number of emergent LRs was scored. For each analysis, three independent biological replicates were performed with 15–20 seedlings per replicate.Root Length Inhibition Assays Seedlings were grown on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with 1% sucrose for 5 days. They were then transferred to media containing either 2,4-D, IAA, 1-NAA, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; Naptalam, Sigma–Aldrich, 33371), 1-napthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA; Sigma–Aldrich, 255416) at the concentrations indicated, or solvent controls [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol], and the position of the root tip was marked. Each plate contained all three genotypes (WT, tno1 mutant, and complemented lines) to compensate for possible effects of inter-plate variation. After 6 days, pictures were acquired and the length from the marked root tip position was measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Root elongation in the presence of the tested chemicals was compared with solvent controls and expressed as percent decrease in root length. At least three biological replicates with a minimum of 20 seedlings per replicate were conducted for each treatment.Analysis of Auxin Response Distribution tno1 plants expressing DR5rev:GFP were generated by crossing tno1 (Kim and Bassham, 2011) with DR5rev:GFP lines (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Homozygous tno1 plants carrying the DR5rev:GFP transgene were selected in subsequent generations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping as previously described (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence visualization. For analysis of auxin redistribution, control and tno1 roots expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated and visualized with a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility. A 40× oil immersion objective lens was used along with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP visualization. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both mutant and WT roots with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed. GFP asymmetry was quantified using Image J by subjecting the confocal images to similar thresholding and post-processing. Equal volume boxes were drawn on the upper and lower flanks and total pixel intensity from the lower vs. upper box was expressed as a ratio. To analyze DR5rev:GFP expression in LRs, a total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six different seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy for each genotype. The number of root tips showing asymmetry of GFP expression was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total observed.FM4-64 Staining and Brefeldin A (BFA) Treatment FM4-64 staining was modified from Dettmer et al. (2006). To test bulk endocytosis, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and subsequently washed twice for 30 s each time in 0.5× MS liquid medium before microscopic analysis. For analyzing arrival of FM4-64 at Brefeldin A bodies, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 35 μM Brefeldin A (BFA) for an hour followed by a 10-min treatment with 4 μM FM4-64 plus 35 μM BFA and two subsequent washes of 30 s each. The root tips were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility, using a 63× oil immersion objective lens and excitation and emission wavelengths of 558 and 734 nm. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both genotypes with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed for each treatment and genotype.Results TNO1 Mediates LR Emergence in an Auxin-dependent Manner Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997). The SYP4 family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin transport (Uemura et al., 2012), hence we tested whether the SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of growth on 0.25× MS medium (Dubrovsky and Forde, 2012). Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its native promoter, termed complemented lines (Kim and Bassham, 2011), were similar to WT seedlings (Figures 1A,B). Since the major source of auxin in the root in the first 10 days after germination is transport from the leaves (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ljung et al., 2001), one possible reason for this defect may be that auxin flux is reduced in tno1, leading to suboptimal auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To confirm that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines (Figure 1C), suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Loss of TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) function delays lateral root emergence in an auxin-dependent fashion. (A) Representative images showing emergent lateral roots (white arrowheads) in wild-type (WT), tno1 (KO), and tno1 complemented (COM) lines. (B) Emergent lateral root density of 10-day-old seedlings grown on 0.25× Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (with 1% sucrose) was calculated by dividing the number of emerging lateral roots by root length. (C) Lateral root primordia density of 7-day-old seedlings was calculated by counting the number of primordia after microscopic analysis of cleared roots and dividing it by the root length. (D) Emergent LR density of 10-day-old seedlings, 5 days after transfer to medium containing 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) or 1 μM indoleacetic acid (IAA). All values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 15–20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test.The lipophilic auxin 1-NAA has been shown to rescue LR defects in the auxin transport mutant aux1 (Marchant et al., 2002). Natural auxin (IAA) treatment also rescues LR emergence in dark conditions (Reed et al., 1998). To test whether the emergence defect may be due to defects in auxin transport and hence reduced root auxin levels, LR emergence in the presence of 1-NAA (Murashige and Skoog, 1962; Marchant et al., 2002) or IAA in the dark (Reed et al., 1998) was assessed. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM NAA or 1 μM IAA, and LR density was analyzed after 5 days of growth. The LR density of tno1 resembled that of WT and complemented lines in the presence of either auxin (Figure 1D), indicating that exogenous auxins can rescue the emergent LR defect in tno1 roots. Therefore, TNO1 influences the temporal control of LR emergence from the primary root.TNO1 is Required for Gravitropic Bending We further examined a possible role for TNO1 in plant auxin responses by investigating gravitropism. Gravitropism involves the bending of a plant organ in response to its change in orientation with respect to gravity (gravistimulation). Gravitropic bending of organs upon gravistimulation is aided by a readjustment of auxin flow. Since a number of proteins involved in gravitropic curvature are recycled and trafficked via the TGN (Strohm et al., 2012), this organelle is critical for regulating downstream events that influence gravitropic plant organ bending. We, therefore, hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might affect dynamics at the TGN and thus lead to a change in the gravitropic bending response. To test this hypothesis, the gravitropic response of WT and tno1 mutant hypocotyls and roots was assessed. The tno1 mutant hypocotyls (Figure 2A) and roots (Figure 2B) showed delayed bending, and the angle of curvature at different time points was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of WT or complemented seedlings. This suggests that the loss of TNO1 causes a delay in the gravitropic bending of Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. Mutant roots and hypocotyls have a similar length to WT under normal growth conditions (Kim and Bassham, 2011), suggesting that the defect in gravitropism is not due to defective growth. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab TNO1 mediates gravitropic bending by an auxin dependent mechanism. (A) Hypocotyl bending of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls after gravistimulation. Dark-grown 5-day-old hypocotyls were gravistimulated in the dark and curvatures were calculated at 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation. (B) Root bending of WT, KO, and COM seedlings after gravistimulation. Light-grown, medium-embedded roots were gravistimulated and root curvatures were calculated at 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation. (C) Exogenous auxins can rescue the gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots. Light-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and then gravistimulated. Root curvatures were calculated after 12 h. (D) Some exogenous auxins can rescue the gravitropic bending defect in tno1 hypocotyls. Roots of dark-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-D, followed by gravistimulation. Hypocotyl curvatures were calculated after 12 h. All values represent the means of three biological replicates with at least 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors. Similar letters indicate no statistical difference while different letters indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test.The gravitropic bending response requires a reprogramming of auxin flow inside the shoot and root (Tanaka et al., 2006; Strohm et al., 2012), raising the possibility that the slower bending rate observed in tno1 could be due to changes in auxin flow. We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype in tno1 mutants is due to defect(s) in auxin transport, it may be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeable auxin 1-NAA, which has been previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in mutants defective in auxin transport (Marchant et al., 1999), the natural auxin IAA, and the influx-specific auxin 2,4-D. Following auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from the bending angles of the WT and complemented lines (Figure 2C), indicating rescue of the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The 2,4-D treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has been previously reported (Surpin et al., 2005) but there were no significant differences between WT and mutant. Similarly, hypocotyl bending was also rescued after a 12-h treatment with either IAA or 1-NAA (Figure 2D), confirming that the gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin-related defects. 2,4-D did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles significantly lower than WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating an effect of 2,4-D on gravitropism in roots but not in hypocotyls (Surpin et al., 2005). The tno1 mutant defects in gravitropic bending, therefore, may be due to defects in auxin transport or response. tno1 Roots Show Increased Sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA Auxin flux into plant cells is facilitated by influx carriers such as AUX1 and the LAX family of transporters, while exit from the cell involves eﬄux carriers belonging to the PIN and PGP families (Peer et al., 2011). Auxin analogs and transport inhibitors are important tools to uncover defects in auxin transport pathways. The auxin analog 2,4-D is an influx-specific substrate while 1-NAA is an eﬄux-specific substrate (Delbarre et al., 1996). The auxin transport inhibitor NPA interferes with auxin eﬄux while 1-NOA interferes with auxin influx and inhibits AUX1 (Thomson et al., 1973; Sussman and Goldsmith, 1981; Yang et al., 2006). To determine the effect of these inhibitors on the tno1 mutant, their effects on root growth were assessed. We found that tno1 roots were significantly (P < 0.05) more sensitive to 30 nM 2,4-D than WT or complemented roots (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with our observation of the failure of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic defect of mutant hypocotyls. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab tno1 roots show increased sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to media with the indicated chemical or solvent as a control and root length was calculated after an additional 6 days of growth. Mean root growth of each genotype on the chemical treatment compared to the mean on the solvent control was expressed as percentage inhibition. Percent inhibition of root length on (A) 30 nM 2,4-D, (B) 1-1-napthoxyacetic acid (NOA; 30, 50, and 70 μM), (C) 30 nM 2,4-D + 10 μM 1-NOA, (D) 40 nM IAA, (E) 100 nM 1-NAA, and (F) 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; 5 and 10 μM) for WT, KO, and COM lines are shown. Values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors derived from means of the three replicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) by a Student’s t-test.One possible explanation for this sensitivity is that influx routes are altered in the tno1 mutant, which led us to test the effect of blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA. Mutant roots showed similar sensitivity to WT and complemented lines across a range of concentrations of 1-NOA (Figure 3B), suggesting that blocking auxin influx affects the tno1 mutant to the same extent as wild-type. 1-NOA has a characteristic protective effect against root growth inhibition by 2,4-D (Parry et al., 2001); we, therefore, tested whether 1-NOA could rescue the root growth inhibition of mutant roots by 2,4-D to comparable levels as in the WT and complemented lines. Seedlings were transferred to medium containing 30 nM 2,4-D and 10 μM 1-NOA. The WT and complemented lines showed a significantly lower inhibition of root length than the mutants (P < 0.05), indicating that when auxin influx is blocked, tno1 mutants still have enhanced sensitivity to 2,4-D (Figure 3C). To determine whether the sensitivity to 2,4-D is also seen with other auxins, root growth inhibition on 40 nM IAA in the dark was assessed. tno1 mutant roots are indeed more sensitive to IAA (P < 0.05) than WT or complemented lines (Figure 3D). By contrast, treatment with 0.1 μM of the membrane-permeable NAA inhibited the growth of tno1 to a similar extent as WT and complemented plants (Figure 3E). Since 2,4-D and IAA are influx-specific substrates and NAA is not, the results are consistent with a possible defect in auxin influx pathways in tno1. tno1, WT, and complemented plants had similar responses to NPA treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that the auxin eﬄux pathway is unaffected in tno1.TNO1 Helps Mediate Auxin Responses during LR Elongation Lateral roots emerge perpendicular to the primary root and gradually start bending rootwards. Recently emerged LRs, which lack an elongation zone (stage I LR) gradually transition into stage II LRs, defined by an elongation zone and asymmetric growth of the upper and lower epidermal cell files (Rosquete et al., 2013). The differential growth peaks in the stage II LRs are due to asymmetric auxin distribution, which in turn is dependent on auxin transport mechanisms. Stage II LRs are thus defined by a characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response, which results in differential cellular elongation and downward root growth. This asymmetric auxin flux at the LR tip is caused by the specific activity and distribution of auxin transporters (Rosquete et al., 2013). The asymmetric auxin distribution pattern diminishes significantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and begin growing parallel to the primary root. It was reported that on average more than 75% of stage II LRs in WT plants display asymmetric distribution of auxin responses at LR tips (Rosquete et al., 2013), visualized by the pattern of DR5rev:GFP expression (Friml et al., 2003). Since TNO1 is linked to LR emergence by a possible auxin-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that asymmetric auxin transport or response is defective in tno1 LRs. Hence, the percentage of LRs showing asymmetric auxin responses in stage II tno1 LR tips would be lower compared to WT (or complemented) root tips. To test this, the percentage of stage II LRs with auxin response asymmetry in WT and tno1 background lines expressing DR5rev:GFP was determined by confocal microscopy. 40% of tno1 stage II LRs displayed auxin asymmetry at the LR tip compared to 80% in WT stage II LRs (Figures 4A,B). Thus, tno1 roots are defective in establishing the correct pattern of auxin response during LR development. This defect could explain the lower emergent LR density observed in tno1 compared to WT, since a disruption of auxin flow or establishment of asymmetry would prevent LR emergence. FIGURE 4.

A total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six seedlings were analyzed.TNO1 Facilitates Shootward Auxin Response during Root Bending Normally, gravitropic bending of the primary root leads to an eventual return of the root tip toward the gravity vector. This occurs via a cascade of signals leading to asymmetric auxin flow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and cortical cells (moving toward the root–shoot junction). During this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending (Ottenschlager et al., 2003; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010; Baldwin et al., 2012). Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending (Figure 2) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs (Figure 4), we hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to a decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation zone. To test this hypothesis, vertical plate-grown WT and tno1 seedlings expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated by rotating the plates by 90°. Confocal images were acquired before gravistimulation and subsequently at 5, 8, and 12 h after gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips (Figures 5A–D). In the WT background, GFP fluorescence progressed shootward from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward appearance of fluorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5B–D). The difference in GFP fluorescence intensity on the upper and lower flanks was expressed as a ratio for each genotype at different time points. This ratio was significantly higher for WT roots than for tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting a stronger response in WT than in the mutants (Figure 5E). This in turn implies that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be due to a decrease in auxin transport, or a difference in auxin response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such a defect could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by a similar mechanism (Rosquete et al., 2013), this could also explain the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response asymmetry in tno1.

Defects in endocytosis and components involved in the endocytic route to the TGN can, therefore, cause a defect in auxin transport pathways. Since tno1 mutants show defects in TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo at the TGN. This in turn would manifest in altered auxin transporter trafficking dynamics, and subsequently alter auxin responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed endocytosis in root epidermal cells using the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64, which is endocytosed and labels early endosomes. To capture early endocytic events, roots of 4-day-old seedlings were stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and then washed twice for 30 s each time in MS medium. Both WT and tno1 root cells showed similar endosome labeling patterns (Figure 6A, yellow arrowheads), suggesting that bulk endocytic uptake is normal in tno1 roots. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab tno1 mutants have normal bulk endocytosis and arrival of membrane cargo from plasma membrane to Brefeldin A (BFA) bodies. (A) Root cells showing uptake of FM4-64 after 2 min of treatment of 4-day-old seedlings with 4 μM FM4-64 in liquid 0.5× MS medium. Yellow arrowheads indicate early endosomes/TGN. (B) Root cells treated with 35 μM BFA for 1 h, followed by a 10 min incubation with 4 μM FM4-64, showing arrival of FM4-64 at BFA bodies. White arrowheads indicate BFA bodies.To confirm that bulk endocytosis was unaffected and that endocytic vesicles are delivered normally to the TGN in the mutant, the incorporation of FM4-64 into BFA bodies was assessed. The fungal toxin BFA causes aggregation of the TGN and TGN-derived endosomes to form BFA bodies (Geldner et al., 2001; Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2009). BFA body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants (Kim and Bassham, 2011). It was hypothesized that if tno1 has defects in the delivery of endocytosed material to the TGN, then FM4-64 labeling of BFA bodies in tno1 roots would be reduced compared with WT roots. To test this hypothesis, 5-day-old WT and mutant seedlings were incubated with 35 μM BFA for an hour to allow formation of BFA bodies. They were then stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 10 min in the presence of BFA, followed by two washes in MS medium containing BFA. The BFA bodies in both WT and tno1 roots showed normal FM4-64 staining (Figure 6B, white arrowheads) after 10 min. Thus, loss of TNO1 does not affect bulk endocytosis and membrane flow from the plasma membrane to the TGN in root cells.Discussion Auxin flow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the specific localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular trafficking machinery. The TGN is an important organelle controlling vesicle trafficking, with the presence of multiple proteins that aid the trafficking of cargoes such as auxin transporters. In this study we have demonstrated a role for a putative tethering factor localized at the TGN in efficient gravitropic bending and LR emergence, possibly by affecting auxin transport. TNO1 may Regulate Gravitropic Responses through Trafficking of Auxin Transporters Auxin flows in a polar manner from the shoot to the root tip, via the vasculature, and then back through the cortical and epidermal cell layers shootward. This polar transport is dependent on the polar localization of auxin transporters to plasma membranes, via trafficking pathways that achieve correct subcellular distribution (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). Auxin transporters undergo endocytic recycling from the plasma membrane as well as being targeted to new plasma membrane domains via the TGN (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). This enables a plant to respond to environmental cues and adjust its growth pattern accordingly. For example, during the bending of roots upon gravistimulation, an accumulation of auxin in the epidermal layer of the elongation zone in the lower half of the root is required to facilitate the bending process (Tanaka et al., 2006; Peer et al., 2011). This occurs by the relocalization of auxin transporters, AUX1 in the columella and lateral rootcap and AUX1 and PIN2 in the epidermal cells (Strohm et al., 2012). The resulting readjustment of auxin flow from the columella via the lateral rootcap cell to the epidermal cells in the root elongation zone leads to differential growth (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Since tno1 has defects in intracellular trafficking and TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011), we hypothesize that these may hinder auxin transport pathways due to change(s) in trafficking of auxin transporter(s). Phenotypic characterization of gravitropic responses in tno1 roots and hypocotyls showed that these mutants have a decreased angle of bending upon gravistimulation. Pharmacological studies with auxin transport inhibitors and exogenous auxin analogs suggest that altered auxin pathways are likely to be the underlying cause of this defect. The gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application of 1-NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin responses. Growth of tno1 roots is hypersensitive to 2,4-D and IAA but not to the eﬄux-specific substrate 1-NAA or the eﬄux blocker NPA, raising the possibility that the auxin influx pathway might be defective while auxin eﬄux is normal. Although blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA does not result in large differences in root elongation between the tno1 mutant and WT, the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the presence of 1-NOA is still higher for the tno1 mutant roots than the WT and complemented lines. This, coupled with the inability of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic bending defect of mutant hypocotyls, may suggest altered responses to the influx-specific substrate 2,4-D. Additionally, the delayed progression of DR5rev:GFP expression in epidermal cells of gravistimulated tno1 roots compared to WT roots suggests that auxin flow from the columella to the epidermis (via the lateral rootcap cells) may be reduced in tno1 roots. Based on these results, we hypothesize that altered auxin influx capacity underlies the gravitropic defects in tno1. Given the role of TNO1, this could occur through altered trafficking of auxin influx carrier(s). However, it is also possible that the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the tno1 mutant is due to differences in auxin signaling, feedback or response, since it is known that the auxin sensing mechanism is complex and varies for different kinds of auxins (Calderón Villalobos et al., 2012). Since auxin transporters are trafficked via endocytosis (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008), we hypothesized that TNO1 may affect endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the TGN/early endosomes and hence alter transporter trafficking dynamics. Bulk uptake and arrival of a general endocytosis marker at the TGN was unaffected in the tno1 mutant and thus the auxin-related defects do not appear to be due to defects in bulk endocytosis. However, it is possible that TNO1 is required for the polar targeting of a particular subset of auxin transporter(s), either as they are newly synthesized or during the recycling process for membrane relocalization. Further detailed characterization of the behavior of such proteins in tno1 cells will help distinguish between these hypotheses. The polar sorting of auxin transporters in plant cells is highly complex and our understanding of how the SNARE machinery might regulate this polarity is incomplete. Vacuolar SNAREs have been shown to play a role in maintaining auxin maxima and localization of the auxin eﬄux carrier PIN1 in the leaf primordium, thereby regulating leaf vasculature (Shirakawa et al., 2009). The SYP4 family of Qa SNAREs affects auxin distribution, root gravitropism, and the intracellular trafficking of the PIN2 transporter to the vacuole for degradation (Uemura et al., 2012). Since TNO1 associates with the SNARE machinery at the TGN, and its loss causes a mis-localization of SYP61 as well as vacuolar sorting defects (Kim and Bassham, 2011), the SYP41/SYP61/VTI12 complex in conjunction with TNO1 may regulate auxin transport by affecting auxin transporter trafficking and turnover.TNO1 Contributes to the Temporal Control of LR Emergence We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in LR emergence and generation of auxin response asymmetry in an emerging LR. LR development begins by division of LR founder cells (single or pairs of pericycle cells facing the xylem poles) in the primary root and subsequent formation of an auxin maximum and increased auxin responsiveness of the founder cells (De Smet et al., 2007; Dubrovsky et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2009). Auxin transport plays a crucial role in LR emergence, with both auxin influx and eﬄux carriers being involved. The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is important for loading auxin into the vascular system (Marchant et al., 2002) and aux1 mutants have an almost 50% reduction in LR number. Auxin in the endodermis and cortical cells induces another auxin influx carrier, LAX3, which also facilitates LR emergence (Swarup et al., 2008). The concerted action of AUX1 and LAX3, with subsequent induction of expression of PIN3 in the cortex, leads to emergence of the LR from the primary root (Swarup and Peret, 2012; Peret et al., 2013). The LR emergence defects observed in tno1 are consistent with altered auxin transport due to disruption in the trafficking or targeting of auxin transporters. tno1 mutants have a significantly reduced percentage (40% vs. 80% in WT) of emergent Stage II LRs with asymmetric DR5rev:GFP expression, raising the possibility of auxin transport defect(s). Since the action of PIN transporters plays a crucial role in establishing this asymmetric pattern of auxin activity in emergent LRs (Rosquete et al., 2013), TNO1 might affect the trafficking of PIN transporters in the LR tip cells during this process. LR emergence occurs within the pericycle and involves degradation of the pectin-rich middle lamella, with subsequent cell separation to allow growth of the LR through multiple cell layers (Vilches-Barro and Maizel, 2014). Focused auxin flow via transporters into the cortex and the epidermis causes an induction of expression of cell wall remodeling enzymes (Swarup et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2013). Secretory cargo, including various cell wall remodeling enzymes, traffics via the Golgi and TGN toward the extracellular space (Foresti and Denecke, 2008; Toyooka et al., 2009; De Caroli et al., 2011), in a pathway potentially mediated by SYP61 (Drakakaki et al., 2012). Hence, it is possible that defects in the TGN, including the mis-localization of SYP61 seen in tno1, could also lead to disrupted secretion of cell wall remodeling enzymes, thus leading to slower LR emergence (Worden et al., 2012). The identification of effectors directly associated with TNO1 may help elucidate its mechanism of action during these auxin-mediated processes. Since tethering factors can interact with Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007), TNO1 could potentially indirectly affect auxin transporter sorting by affecting the Rab cycle or the function of Rab effectors. Selective targeting of auxin transporters between the plasma membrane and the TGN could be defective in tno1 independent of the constitutive pathways that constantly recycle them between these membranes. Turnover of auxin transporters could also be reduced due to defective targeting to the vacuole for degradation. Analysis of the trafficking of specific auxin transporters in the tno1 mutant would help to distinguish between these possibilities.Author Contributions RR and DB designed the experiments.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.Conclusions We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, Microtubules",

    "methods": "Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the complemented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.8% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22 °C in the dark. Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [7, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 °C in long-day conditions (16 h light) on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 1.5% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days after which the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another 4 days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using a Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with a Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image J [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/L). Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyzamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for 5 days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing 7-day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm 3% low melting point agarose on a slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with a Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope. Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using a Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alternatively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in a working aqueous solution (10 μg/ml) of propidium iodide for 1 min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 s. The roots were mounted in water and visualized using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [7, 41] using ImageJ [38]. Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti-α- tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted 1:100, were used for immunolabeling of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as a secondary antibody, diluted 1:500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using a 40X (1.25 NA) or 63X (1.4 NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis.",
    "results": "Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (1.5% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seedlings allowed to grow for an additional 4 days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impenetrable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alternates between rightward and leftward corrective deviations resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [4, 7]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinusoidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-0) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for deviation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation (β) (Fig. 1c) [7, 39]. tno1 mutants had a higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d; P < 0.05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) (Fig. 1c) and is a sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. A positive Lx results in a positive HGI value, which then signifies a rightward deviation while a negative value suggests leftward deviation [39]. tno1 roots had a significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e; P < 0.05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an increased rightward deviation from the vertical.

Error bars indicate standard error. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-test Skewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely understood, but has been proposed to be a result of the circumnutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or circular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [6, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes a spiraling of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. A lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause a twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage [9]. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward-skewing mutants usually display a dominant left-handed CFR [4, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed a marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have a vertical arrangement of cell files with a lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal imaging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed a distinctive left-handed CFR with a higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quantify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the longitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Fig. 2.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates, with at least 10 cell files from 5 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard error. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-test Skewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as MT alignment controls the direction of cellulose deposition [46, 47]. Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or leftward skewing, with a dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display a handedness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is complex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is localized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from a recent study in which a TGN-localized protein was shown to activate a kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [9, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, b). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from 0 μM to 0.2 μM taxol is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the WT and complemented line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of 0.2 μM taxol reveals a larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, e). The phenotype is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of a slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Fig. 3.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-test Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants The MT-destabilizing chemical propyzamide (PPD) also enhances rightward skewing in WT seedlings [9]. Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests a MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed a slight increase in rightward skew at 1 μM PPD and a marked increase at 3 μM PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, b). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was significantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c). The increase in skewing for the complemented lines was slightly higher than the WT, suggesting that the precise expression pattern of the TNO1 protein may be reflected in the extent of root skewing. While the TNO1 transgene in the complemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates with at least 10 cell files from 3 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard errorsWe hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with a reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal microscopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on 3 μM PPD reveals a twisting of WT and complemented epidermal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, e). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology. There were no measurable differences between the root growth rates of the WT, tno1 and complemented lines when grown in the presence or absence of PPD (not shown), and it is therefore unlikely that the difference in skewing is due to differences in growth rate. Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on 3 μM PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to a possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall deposition that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form normally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. Fig. 5.

Scale bar =100 μmTo assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypocotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to PPD-treated WT and complemented seedlings (Fig. 5b). The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiralization of the cells observed in the treated WT and complemented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concentrations of PPD (such as 2 μM) has been reported to cause a decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has a more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1. The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually arranged in a transverse orientation to facilitate anisotropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of a MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed between angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have a change in the pitch of MT arrays associated with a corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrangements similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains a transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left-handed CFR [9, 54] while the mor1–1 mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays a left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for a change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to a right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on a slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quantitative analyses on collected images were performed utilizing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest a mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue line along the 0–180 degree axis) (Fig. 6b). To assess whether a difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mechanism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Fig. 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate a role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to induce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from a disordered state in the meristematic zone to a transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [4, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather a transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates a complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of a MT-associated protein such as a kinesin; as an example, a TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or a lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have a distinct CFR [54, 58, 59]. Moreover, CFR can still occur upon MT disruption with MT destabilizing agents such as oryzalin and PPD [53]. This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor involved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, including mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the anisotropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. A lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types compared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [9, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting a role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew despite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized Q-SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Proteomic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting a role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as a link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62–65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose synthase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66–68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose synthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CESTRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be crucial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1–1, any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibitors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that a cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mutants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reactions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose deposition patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifolia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division patterns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that individual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be a challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play a key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1’s role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stability and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1’s precise role will help in elucidation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered a role for a TGN-localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impenetrable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest a possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. A better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to information that can be used to manipulate root growth and development patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture. This could subsequently result in engineering superior crops with better soil penetration and nutrient assimilation traits.",

Copyright notice ID: 5387210 PMID: 28399805 Abstract Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.Conclusions We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, MicrotubulesBackground Establishment of the root system of a plant is crucial for efficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root development and architecture are well-studied [1] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [2, 3]. Root growth into the substratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expansion [4]. This leads to a cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture. Studying and simulating root movement and directional growth in the laboratory on synthetic growth media has revealed distinct movement types, and some of the genes and pathways that control them [4]. Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings display various growth behaviors depending on external conditions. When embedded in a homogeneous medium (penetrable agar), roots grow downward in response to gravity and show minimal deviation from the gravity vector. By contrast, when roots are subjected to multiple directional cues, complicated growth patterns occur [5]. For example, Arabidopsis roots grown on a slanted impenetrable medium (1.5% agar) show a characteristic deviation from the vertical (skewing) with a periodic wave-like pattern along their trajectory (waving). This arises due to a combination of touch [6], gravitropism [7], circumnutation [5], and physical interaction between the root tip and the growth medium [8]. Skewing and waving roots display a characteristic twisting of epidermal cell files along the root, referred to as cell file rotation (CFR). When roots of Arabidopsis seedlings skew and wave, the succession of sinusoidal waves alternate between left-handed and right-handed CFRs, which correlates with their rightward and leftward movement respectively [6, 7]. According to Rutherford and Masson (1996), skewing is described as rightward or leftward when viewed from the back of the plate [7] while handedness of the CFR is defined as left-handed or right-handed when viewing the axis of the root pointing shootwards. Roots of Arabidopsis grown on a slanted, hard medium exhibit a dominant left-handed rotation around the growth axis resulting in a predominantly counterclockwise/left-handed epidermal CFR. This usually corresponds to a rightward skewing when seen from the back of the plate [7, 9, 10]. CFR also typically correlates with an oblique microtubule (MT) array orientation in the twisting cell files, although exceptions do exist [11]. Multiple factors such as external cues (e.g. moisture, light or gravity), hormonal pathways, and cytoskeletal and cell wall dynamics influence the direction of root growth [4]. External cues signal changes in hormone signaling pathways, including auxin [12–14], ethylene [8, 15], cytokinin [16] and brassinosteroid pathways [17]. Downstream of hormonal and environmental perception, changes in the cytoskeleton and in cell wall deposition patterns modulate cell division and cell expansion dynamics, thus mediating root movements. Defects in tubulin structure or activity or in MT-associated proteins result in altered MT dynamics and array orientation. This then leads to changes in cell expansion and affects CFR and skewing [18, 19]. Cell wall properties and the trafficking of cell wall components to the plasma membrane are key to root elongation and movement as inferred from the altered root movements observed in mutants defective in cellulose deposition, wall-anchored proteins or crosslinking of cell wall components [20–22]. Sorting of cell wall components occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans- most cisternae of the Golgi [23]. It acts as an early endosome, receiving endocytosed cargo as well as directing vacuolar and secretory traffic, with distinct subdomains that function in various trafficking routes [24–30]. Specific membrane fusion factors called SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) maintain vesicle trafficking fidelity and cargo sorting within cells [31]. The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family is required for multiple transport pathways that in turn regulate auxin homeostasis and disease resistance [30]. SYP61, another TGN-localized SNARE that interacts with SYP41, functions in vacuolar trafficking and secretion of cell wall enzymes such as cellulose synthase and pectin-polysaccharide-modifying protein. This indicates a role for SYP61 in trafficking of cell wall components and enzymes for their synthesis and modification [32–34]. TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein) is a TGN-localized coiled-coil protein that interacts with the SYP41 SNARE machinery. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 (tno1) partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo, mis-localize SYP61 and display altered TGN dynamics and slower gravitropic responses [35, 36]. Trafficking at the TGN plays a role in auxin responses, trafficking of cell wall components, and cell expansion, all of which are important for root growth and movement. In addition, gravitropic bending is delayed in tno1 roots, suggesting defects in directional growth of roots. We therefore investigated a potential function for TNO1 in root movement. We report here that TNO1 acts as a negative regulator of root skewing, since tno1 mutant roots have enhanced skewing which also correlates with an enhanced CFR.Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the complemented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.8% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22 °C in the dark.Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [7, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 °C in long-day conditions (16 h light) on 0.5X solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 1.5% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days after which the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another 4 days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using a Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with a Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image J [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/L).Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyzamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for 5 days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing 7-day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm 3% low melting point agarose on a slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with a Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope.Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using a Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alternatively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in a working aqueous solution (10 μg/ml) of propidium iodide for 1 min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 s. The roots were mounted in water and visualized using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [7, 41] using ImageJ [38].Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti-α- tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted 1:100, were used for immunolabeling of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as a secondary antibody, diluted 1:500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using a 40X (1.25 NA) or 63X (1.4 NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis.Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (1.5% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seedlings allowed to grow for an additional 4 days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impenetrable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alternates between rightward and leftward corrective deviations resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [4, 7]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinusoidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-0) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for deviation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation (β) (Fig. 1c) [7, 39]. tno1 mutants had a higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d; P < 0.05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) (Fig. 1c) and is a sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. A positive Lx results in a positive HGI value, which then signifies a rightward deviation while a negative value suggests leftward deviation [39]. tno1 roots had a significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e; P < 0.05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an increased rightward deviation from the vertical.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) by Student’s t-testSkewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely understood, but has been proposed to be a result of the circumnutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or circular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [6, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes a spiraling of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. A lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause a twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage [9]. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward-skewing mutants usually display a dominant left-handed CFR [4, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed a marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have a vertical arrangement of cell files with a lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal imaging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed a distinctive left-handed CFR with a higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quantify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the longitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Fig. 2.

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) by Student’s t-testSkewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as MT alignment controls the direction of cellulose deposition [46, 47]. Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or leftward skewing, with a dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display a handedness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is complex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is localized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from a recent study in which a TGN-localized protein was shown to activate a kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [9, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, b). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from 0 μM to 0.2 μM taxol is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the WT and complemented line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of 0.2 μM taxol reveals a larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, e). The phenotype is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of a slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Fig. 3.

Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests a MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed a slight increase in rightward skew at 1 μM PPD and a marked increase at 3 μM PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, b). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was significantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c). The increase in skewing for the complemented lines was slightly higher than the WT, suggesting that the precise expression pattern of the TNO1 protein may be reflected in the extent of root skewing. While the TNO1 transgene in the complemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types.

All values represent the means of 3 biological replicates with at least 10 cell files from 3 seedlings analyzed for each replicate. Error bars indicate standard errorsWe hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with a reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal microscopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on 3 μM PPD reveals a twisting of WT and complemented epidermal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, e). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology. There were no measurable differences between the root growth rates of the WT, tno1 and complemented lines when grown in the presence or absence of PPD (not shown), and it is therefore unlikely that the difference in skewing is due to differences in growth rate. Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on 3 μM PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to a possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall deposition that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form normally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. Fig. 5.

Scale bar =100 μm. b Representative agarose imprints of the base of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls grown on solvent control or 3 μM PPD for 7 days, imaged with a macro zoom microscope. Scale bar =100 μmTo assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypocotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to PPD-treated WT and complemented seedlings (Fig. 5b). The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiralization of the cells observed in the treated WT and complemented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concentrations of PPD (such as 2 μM) has been reported to cause a decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has a more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1.The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually arranged in a transverse orientation to facilitate anisotropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of a MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed between angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have a change in the pitch of MT arrays associated with a corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrangements similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains a transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left-handed CFR [9, 54] while the mor1–1 mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays a left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for a change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to a right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on a slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quantitative analyses on collected images were performed utilizing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest a mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue line along the 0–180 degree axis) (Fig. 6b). To assess whether a difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mechanism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Fig. 6.

Error bars indicate standard errorsDiscussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate a role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to induce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from a disordered state in the meristematic zone to a transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [4, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather a transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates a complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of a MT-associated protein such as a kinesin; as an example, a TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or a lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have a distinct CFR [54, 58, 59]. Moreover, CFR can still occur upon MT disruption with MT destabilizing agents such as oryzalin and PPD [53]. This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor involved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, including mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the anisotropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. A lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types compared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [9, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting a role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew despite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized Q-SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Proteomic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting a role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as a link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62–65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose synthase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66–68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose synthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CESTRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be crucial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1–1, any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibitors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that a cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mutants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reactions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose deposition patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifolia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division patterns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that individual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be a challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play a key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1’s role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stability and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1’s precise role will help in elucidation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis.Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered a role for a TGN-localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impenetrable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest a possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. A better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to information that can be used to manipulate root growth and development patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture. This could subsequently result in engineering superior crops with better soil penetration and nutrient assimilation traits.Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Patrick Masson and Dr. Kate Baldwin for advice on the skewing assays, Colton McNinch and Dr. Xiaochen Yang for technical help and advice, Dr. Bin Dong and Jennifer Johnson for assistance with the MFA software, Margaret Carter for guidance on confocal imaging and Dr. Divita Mathur for conceptual insights.

    "title": "The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface. Keywords: KASH protein, SUN protein, Centrosome, Centriole, Coiled-coil proteins, Sperm basal body, Spermatogenesis",
    "introduction": "Introduction Within eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999; Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994; Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999; Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005; Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes. Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC-Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Starr and Fischer, 2005; Crisp et al., 2006; Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006; Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002; Hodzic et al., 2004; King et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002; Zhang et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2004; Wilhelmsen et al., 2005; Ketema et al., 2007). A detailed model for the mechanism by which the Caenorhabditis elegans KASH protein ZYG-12 links the zygotic centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE) has been proposed (Malone et al., 2003), which involves direct interaction of certain ZYG-12 isoforms with the microtubule motor dynein. The Drosophila genome encodes two KASH protein genes, klarsicht (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999) and msp-300 (Zhang et al., 2002) and two SUN protein genes, klaroid (Kracklauer et al., 2007) and gene CG6589. CG6589, previously termed giacomo, has proved to have sequence homology to the testis-specific mammalian SUN protein Spag4 (Shao et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2004) (supplementary material Fig. S1) and thus we have re-named the gene spag4. We show here that Spag4 has a crucial role in spermatogenesis comparable to that of other SUN proteins: it is necessary for anchoring the centriole or basal body (BB) to the spermatid nucleus. But surprisingly, this role does not require formation of a typical LINC complex with a KASH protein. Instead, we have shown that the coiled-coil cytoplasmic protein Yuri Gagarin (Armstrong et al., 2006; Texada et al., 2008) is an essential component of the Spag4-BB anchoring mechanism, and that regulation of dynein-dynactin localization by Spag4 has a role in the process.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Drosophila stocks Transgenic lines were prepared by standard methods at UT Austin or at Genetic Services (Sudbury, MA). Standard genetic crosses were used to introduce: (1) transgenes pC4-spag4, pC4-spag4:gfp, pC4-spag4:6xmyc, pC4-spag4-SUNstop and p50:GFP into the background of spag4-knockout allele #6 and (2) pC4-spag4:6xmyc and p50:GFP into the yuriF64 background. p50:GFP and Dlc90Fe155/TMB Tb were obtained from Thomas Hays, University of Minnesota, MN, USA. w, αTub:gfp, w, yfp:asl lines (Rebollo et al., 2004; Varmark et al., 2007) and the deficiency spanning spag4 Df(2L)Prl, were obtained from Cayetano Gonzalez, Institute for Research and Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain and the Drosophila Stock Center (Bloomington), respectively. Molecular biology Molecular biology manipulations were performed using standard techniques. Unless specified, SuperScript II RT reagents and Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used, and primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer sequences are provided in supplementary material Fig. S2. DNA sequencing was performed at the UT Austin ICMB Core Facility. Expression analysis of spag4 Total RNA from ten male or female larvae, pupae and adults was isolated and treated with DNase I, as described (Kracklauer et al., 2007). RT was performed using an oligo (dT) primer followed by PCR with primers P1 and P2. Determination of spag4 cDNA ends by RACE RT-PCR was carried out using male pupal total RNA isolated as recommended in the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX), and then used in 5′ RLM-RACE and 3′ RACE. The 5′ end of the gene was amplified using the RNA adapter-specific forward outer and inner primers, and the gene-specific reverse primer P3. To amplify the 3′ end of the gene, anchored oligo-(dT) adapter primers from the FirstChoice kit were used in RT. In the PCR, the gene-specific forward primer P4 and the 3′ adapter-specific outer primer were used. 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and their sequences verified. A complete spag4 cDNA with 5′ and 3′ UTRs was generated by PCR using a mixture of partially overlapping RACE products as template and the 5′ and 3′ adapter-specific primers. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy, sequenced and catalogued as EF537040 at . Construction of spag4 genomic transgenes The transgene pC4-spag4 was generated by ligating the spag4 coding region as a 4.9 kb PstI fragment from BACR02J20 into the PstI site of pCaSpEr-4 (pC4) (Thummel and Pirrotta, 1992). The GFP-tagged version, pC4-spag4:gfp, was generated by ligating the GFP ORF from pUAST-gfp (Kracklauer et al., 2007) immediately downstream of the spag4 coding region in pC4-spag4. For this purpose, an AscI site was introduced immediately upstream of the spag4 stop codon using the QuikChange II PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primer pair P13-P14. The GFP ORF with AscI sites on both ends (generated by PCR using primers P11-P12 on the pUAST-gfp template) was then cloned into this AscI site. To generate pC4-spag4:6xmyc, a 6xmyc ORF was amplified from the pUAST-6xmyc vector (Kracklauer et al., 2007) using the PCR primers P15 and P16, and the ORF was then cloned into the AscI site as for pC4-spag4:GFP. To generate pC4-spag4SUNstop, a stop codon was introduced into the 4.9 kb PstI fragment using the mutagenic primers P21-P22, and the resulting mutated fragment was cloned into the PstI site of pC4 as described above. Generation of spag4 knockout The targeting construct (pW35-spag4HRKO) was generated as follows. DNA sequences of ~3 kb (upstream) and ~5 kb (downstream) flanking the spag4 coding region were amplified by PCR using hot-start Herculase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), primer sets P5-P6 and P7-P8, and BAC02J20 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) as template. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy and their sequences verified. The upstream 3 kb fragment was excised from pGEM-T-Easy with NotI and cloned into that site of pW35 (Gong and Golic, 2003). The downstream 5 kb fragment was excised from pGEM-T-Easy with BamHI and AvrII, then cloned into those sites in pW35 downstream of the w+ marker gene, resulting in pW35-spag4HRKO. After generation of transgenic lines, a cross of 500 y w, pW35 spag4HRKO/FM7c, gfp virgin females with 500 (y) w;; [hs-FLP],[hs-I-SceI]/TM3, Sb males was set up with subsequent embryo manipulation and heat shocks, as described previously (Kracklauer et al., 2007). ~400 crosses of 3-4 w+-mosaic (y) w, pW35-spag4HRKO/+;; [hs-FLP],[hs-I-SceI]/+ F1 virgin females and 3-4 w; hs-FLP males were performed. F2 progeny were screened for a single male from each cross with solid w+ eyes, indicative of targeted insertion events. Insertions were mapped for 100 independent F2 candidate knockout males using standard methods; for 87 candidates, the insertion mapped to chromosome 2 as expected. For ~50 such stocks, spag4 targeting was assessed by Southern blotting (Kracklauer et al., 2007). Ultimately, five independent spag4 knockout alleles – 1, 6, 11, 12 and 15 – were isolated. Allele 6 was used for most studies. Quantitative fertility assays Twenty individual spag4 homozygous or spag4/Df(2L)Prl males were each crossed to two w1118 virgins. As a control, 20 crosses using w1118 males homozygous for a wild-type (Oregon-R) copy of chromosome 2 (w1118;ORC2iso) were set up. For the fertility rescue assays, 20 individual spag4 homozygous males bearing a single copy of the transgene pC4-spag4, pC4-spag4:gfp, pC4-spag4:6xmyc or pC4-spag4-SUNstop were used. To assay female fertility, 20 virgin spag4 homozygous or spag4/Df(2L)Prl females were assayed individually with two w1118 males. Similar crosses with w1118; ORC2iso virgin females were set up in parallel as wild-type controls. After 1 week, average combined numbers of larvae and pupae per vial were determined. TEM Testes were fixed on ice for 2 hours in PBS with 2% glutaraldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA], rinsed, then post-fixed at room temperature for 2 hours in 2% OsO4 (EMS) and 0.8% K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1× symcollidine buffer (McDonald, 1984; Jinguji and Ishikawa, 1990). Tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in resin using standard procedures. 50-60 nm sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM208 electron microscope. Immunocytology Testes were fixed and stained essentially as described (Lin et al., 1996; Zhong and Belote, 2007; Texada et al., 2008), and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 50% glycerol. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-MYC, 1:2000; rabbit anti-MYC, 1:200; rabbit anti-CM1, 1:100 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rabbit anti-Vasa, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-γ-tubulin, 1:500 (Sigma) and chicken anti-Yuri, 1:400 (Texada et al., 2008). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-chicken, all at 1:500 (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain F-actin and TOPRO-3 to stain DNA, were mixed into secondary antibody solutions at 15 μl phalloidin/ml and 1 μl/ml TOPRO-3. DAPI for DNA staining was added to mounting solution at 1 μl/ml. Testes were imaged with Leica AOBS SP2 and Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscopes and a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using Metamorph deconvolution software. Adobe Photoshop was used to process all images. In situ hybridization (ISH) ISH was carried out essentially as described (White-Cooper et al., 1998), using an 820 bp PCR product from the spag4 ORF to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche).",
    "results": "Results Spliced spag4 mRNA is found only in testes and encodes a transmembrane domain protein We first analyzed the expression of spag4 mRNA by RT-PCR, and observed that spliced mRNA is found only in male larvae, pupae and adults (Fig. 1A), suggesting testis-specific expression. Expression of spag4 mRNA characterized at www.flyatlas.org confirms this testis specificity. In situ hybridization demonstrated that spag4 mRNA expression peaks in the early primary spermatocyte region of adult testes (Fig. 1B). Low levels of the unspliced precursor transcript were observed in females (Fig. 1A), but appear to be functionless given the viability and fertility of spag4-null females (see below). Fig. 1.

Blue bars, males; pink bars, females.Although all SUN proteins described to date have a transmembrane (TM) domain N-terminal to the SUN domain (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995; Malone et al., 1999; Shao et al., 1999; Dreger et al., 2001; Malone et al., 2003; Hodzic et al., 2004; Kracklauer et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007), the originally annotated Spag4 protein sequence contains no TM domain (Tweedie et al., 2009). Using 5′ RNA-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE), we identified 5′ spag4 mRNA sequences encoding an N-terminus with a single TM helix (Fig. 1C). 3′ RACE also revealed a previously uncharacterized 3′ UTR. The corrected spag4 gene region spans ~1.2 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1C). spag4 mutant males are sterile To determine the function of spag4, we generated knockout mutations by ends-out homologous recombination (Fig. 1D,E, and Materials and Methods). Homozygous mutant individuals developed normally, yielding adults that were wild type in appearance. However, mutant males [either homozygous or in trans to deficiency Df(2L)Prl] were completely sterile (Fig. 1F). spag4-null males courted, mounted and copulated with females (data not shown), suggesting that male sterility is not a behavioral defect. Mutant females were fertile, consistent with a lack of spag4 mRNA splicing in females. Male fertility was restored to spag4 mutants by introducing a single copy of a 4.9 kb genomic spag4 transgene (Fig. 1F and supplementary material Fig. S3). A transgene generating Spag4 protein lacking the SUN domain (supplementary material Fig. S3) did not restore fertility to spag4-null males (Fig. 1F), indicating that Spag4 requires this domain for its role in spermatogenesis. Dynamic Spag4 subcellular localization during gametogenesis To address how Spag4 contributes to male gametogenesis, we examined protein localization in the testis using flies expressing Spag4 tagged C-terminally with 6×MYC or GFP. Transgenes similar to the spag4 rescue construct containing these tags (supplementary material Fig. S3) restored fertility to spag4 males, indicating that the tagged genes have wild-type function and that the tagged proteins are likely to localize normally. All independent insertions of both transgenes produced identical localization patterns. In general, Spag4:6×MYC gave stronger signals, but for mature sperm in the seminal vesicle, the Spag4:GFP signal was more robust (Fig. 2J). Most data shown here derives from Spag4:6×MYC. Fig. 2.

A concentration of Spag4:6×MYC at the apical tip of elongating spermatid nuclei (H,I′) is shown by the basal body marker YFP:Asl (I) to lie between the BB and the nuclei proper (I″). This Spag4:6×MYC focus persists on mature sperm in the seminal vesicle (J), similarly to the BB marker YFP:Asl (K). Red, Spag4:6×MYC; blue, DAPI; green, γ-tubulin in F, α-Tub:GFP in G″, YFP:Asl in I and K, Spag4:GFP in J. Scale bars: 150 μm (A), 20 μm (B-G,J,K) and 10 μm (H,I).In the Drosophila testis, germ cells are arranged in a spatio-temporal order, from the apical tip to the basal seminal vesicle. Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, Spag4:6×MYC was not detectable at the apical tip, where germ-line stem cells and spermatogonia reside (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2A). Four rounds of synchronous divisions yield 16 interconnected spermatogonia, encapsulated in a cyst. These spermatogonia become spermatocytes and commit to meiosis, resulting in 64 interconnected round spermatids. Spag4:6×MYC was first detected in primary spermatocytes where it was associated closely with the NE, as demonstrated by colocalization with lamin (supplementary material Fig. S4D-F). Spag4:6×MYC remained at the NE as nuclei became grooved and lobular during primary spermatocyte growth (Fig. 2B). Upon NE breakdown, Spag4:6×MYC colocalized with subsets of microtubules in the meiosis I spindles (Fig. 2C; supplementary material Fig. S4A-C), and possibly the parafusorial membranes (Fuller, 1993). In late meiosis II, Spag4:6×MYC again associated with spindle microtubules (supplementary material Fig. S4A′-C′) cupping the astral region of re-forming nuclei (Fig. 2D). As post-meiotic round spermatids formed, Spag4:6×MYC once again localized to the NE (Fig. 2E). Once meiosis is complete, the single centriole of each round spermatid attaches to its nuclear surface, and dramatic morphological changes commence. The centriole differentiates into the BB, from which the axoneme develops, and the nuclei elongate and condense to a needle-like shape. The Spag4:6×MYC protein at the NE initially transformed into a hemispherical cap (the ‘cap’) with the centriole at its apex (Fig. 2F). Subsequently, on the elongating nuclei, Spag4:6×MYC assumed a two-component pattern, with a focus of the protein at the centriole or BB attachment site, and a stripe of protein along the long axis of the nuclei (the ‘stripe’). From EM studies, Tokuyasu (Tokuyasu, 1974) identified electron-dense material, termed the dense complex, which initially formed as a pericentriolar hemispherical cap on round spermatid nuclei and was later present as a stripe rich in microtubules along the length of the elongating nuclei. That the stripe of Spag4:6×MYC is at the position of the dense complex was established by colocalization in testes expressing α-tubulin:GFP (Fig. 2G-G″). As elongation proceeded, the Spag4:6×MYC stripe along the dense complex gradually disappeared, and the focus at the BB became more compact and assumed a distinctive trefoil or bell shape (Fig. 2H). As shown by colocalization with the pancentriolar marker YFP:Asl (Varmark et al., 2007) (Fig. 2I-I″), this focus of Spag4 protein was between the caudal nuclear tip and BB, thus placing it at the ~0.5 μm indentation (the ‘dent’) in the nucleus in which the BB sits (Tokuyasu, 1975). Spag4:GFP persisted on sperm nuclei in the seminal vesicle (Fig. 2J), as did YFP:Asl (Fig. 2K), suggesting that Spag4 remains at the BB attachment site in mature sperm. This dynamic pattern of Spag4 localization is unusual; other SUN proteins localize specifically to the NE (Malone et al., 1999; Malone et al., 2003; Hodzic et al., 2004; Kracklauer et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007), microtubules (Shao et al., 1999) or the MTOC or SPB (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995; Xiong et al., 2008). However, this range of localizations for Spag4 might be more a property of the developmental process in question rather than the protein. So far, other SUN proteins have been studied in less complex developmental situations. The initial defect in spag4 mutant males is failure of centriole-nuclear attachment To address the role of Spag4 during sperm development, we analyzed spermatogenesis in the spag4-null mutant. Our goal was to identify the first detectable defects caused by the mutation, because later problems might be secondary to these initial failures. Despite the association of Spag4 with the NE of the primary spermatocyte, in the spag4 mutant, the primary spermatocyte stage appeared similar to the wild type (Fig. 3A,D). However, beginning in the round spermatid stage, some disruption of the centriole linkage was detectable (Fig. 3B,E), which became pronounced and fully penetrant as the nuclei condensed and elongated. In contrast to the wild type (Fig. 3C), in all elongate spag4 mutant nuclear bundles examined, BBs labelled with YFP:Asl had lost their normal association with the caudal nuclear tips and were scattered along the nuclear bundles (NBs) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, every NB observed showed some degree of dispersion within the cysts, and the scattered nuclei frequently curled in the terminal region of the testis (Fig. 3H). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to maintain the correct centriole-nuclear association, and has a role in shaping elongated nuclei. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Nuclear-centriolar dissociation during elongation stages is the earliest visible defect in spag4 mutant testes. Centriolar association with primary spermatocyte (A), round spermatid (B) and elongating (C) nuclei in wild-type testes. In spag4 mutant testes, centriolar association is normal in primary spermatocytes (D) and mostly normal in round spermatids (E), and early elongating spermatids (F). (G) Fully penetrant nuclear-centriolar dissociation becomes apparent in later elongation stages. (H) Nuclei contort in advanced elongation stages. (I) The microtubules of the dense complex stripe are retained on spag4 spermatid nuclei. Scale bars: 20 μm (A,D), 10 μm (B,C,E,I) and 15 μm (F,G,H). Later defects in spag4 mutant spermatogenesis In wild-type males, the seminal vesicle fills with mature sperm after several days of sequestration away from females. By contrast, no mature sperm accumulated in the seminal vesicles of sequestered spag4 mutant males (supplementary material Fig. S5), suggesting that developmental processes subsequent to BB-nuclear interaction also fail in the mutant. We thus investigated events during individualization, the process immediately following elongation. During individualization, elongated, syncytially connected spermatids are separated into individual sperm. An individualization complex (IC) composed of 64 actin cones that assemble around individual sperm nuclei forms, and then moves along the cyst towards the caudal ends of the spermatids (Hicks et al., 1999; Noguchi and Miller, 2003; Noguchi et al., 2008). As the IC moves along the cyst, each spermatid becomes surrounded by plasma membrane, and excess cytoplasm is pushed as a cytoplasmic bulge to the caudal tip of the cyst to form a ‘waste bag’. Using TEM to analyze cross-sections of testes, we found that spag4 mutants had defective individualization. In the wild type, cross-sections reveal an iterative pattern of individualized spermatids, each with a single axoneme and major and minor mitochondrial derivative (MD) surrounded by plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). In spag4 mutant cysts, arrays of axonemes each associated with a single major and minor MD were also seen (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, although axoneme structure was not analyzed in detail, it appeared grossly normal, with a small number of axonemes lacking the central microtubule doublets (typically less than 10 axonemes/cyst). However, both MDs showed failure to condense fully, a problem that was most marked for the minor MD. But most strikingly, plasma membrane investment largely failed to occur (Fig. 4D,E) and copious amounts of cytoplasm remained in the mutant cysts (Fig. 4E). Thus, sperm individualization and cytoplasmic elimination are severely affected in the spag4 mutant. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Individualization fails in the spag4 mutant testes. (A) Normal actin cones of the individualization complex (IC) form on wild-type elongated nuclei. (B) Abnormal actin deposition forms aberrant ICs in the spag4 mutant. (C) Lack of actin deposition on curled nuclei in the spag4 mutant. (D) TEM of wild-type elongated cyst cross-section. Black lines denote axis through the central doublet of the axoneme; within a wild-type cyst, spermatid cross-sections (red lines) lie at a constant angle (clockwise 45° to the central doublet. (E) In spag4 mutant cysts, aberrant angles demonstrate spermatid-axoneme misalignment. Red arrowhead indicates missing central doublet in spag4 axoneme. Images in D and E were taken in comparable regions of wild-type and mutant testes (towards terminal epithelium, immediately apical to cyst coiling region). Black arrows indicate major mitochondrial derivatives (MDs) and white arrows, minor MDs. Black arrowhead in D indicates plasma membrane. Both major and minor MDs are less condensed in spag4 mutant than in the wild type, and large regions of ribosome-rich cytoplasm persist in the cysts (blue dotted line). Scale bars: ~10 μm (A-C), 500 nm (D,E).A spatially controlled caspase cascade used in a non-apoptotic context promotes spermatid individualization (Huh et al., 2004; Muro et al., 2006). We found that caspase activation, as monitored with an antibody (anti-CM1) that recognizes the active form of the Drosophila effector caspase Ice (Arama et al., 2003; Muro et al., 2006; Zhong and Belote, 2007), was similar in spag4 mutant and wild-type testes (supplementary material Fig. S6A-B′). Successful activation of caspase was further confirmed by staining testes with Acridine Orange, a dye taken up by cysts undergoing individualization. (supplementary material Fig. S6A″,B″) (Arama and Steller, 2006). Thus, defective individualization in the mutant is not due to defective caspase activation. Instead, the defects appear to originate in aberrant formation of ICs. In the spag4 mutant, the individual actin cones were disrupted, with cones no longer forming organized ICs (Fig. 4A,B). In bundles of contorted nuclei, actin cones were often missing altogether (Fig. 4C). The disorganized ICs tended not to progress caudally, and mutant testes lacked cytoplasmic bulges and waste bags, indicating failures in individualization (supplementary material Fig. S6). Despite failed individualization, the elongated syncytial cysts in spag4 mutants attempted the final coiling process that precedes sperm movement into the seminal vesicle: the terminal region of mutant testes thus filled with coiling cysts (supplementary material Fig. S5D). Phenotype comparisons suggest interactions with yuri and dynein-dynactin but not known KASH proteins spag4 encodes a SUN protein and localizes to the NE during most of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the SUN domain is essential for the role of spag4 in male fertility (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that Spag4 functions as a typical SUN protein, forming a LINC complex with a KASH protein partner. However, our data indicate that neither of the two Drosophila KASH proteins (Klarsicht and MSP-300) is a Spag4 partner in the testis. For both genes, mutations that eliminate the KASH domain are available: msp300ΔKASH was generated by ends-out recombination (Xie and Fischer, 2008) and the klarCD4 mutation came from EMS mutagenesis that generated a suitably positioned stop codon (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2005). Mutant males of both genotypes were fertile (Fig. 5A) and in all cysts examined for msp300ΔKASH males, klarCD4 males and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double-mutant males, (44-95 cysts in 10 testes per genotype), the centrioles remained associated with the spermatid nuclei during elongation (Fig. 5B-D) and nuclear bundling, IC formation and IC progression were normal. There was no heterozygous effect of the spag4-null genotype on the fertility of klarCD4 mutant males (Fig. 5A) and the only aberrancy detected in the spermatid cysts of these various genotypes was the occasional apical mislocalization of nuclear bundles in klarCD4 and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double-mutant males (data not shown). The doubly mutant males were somewhat subfertile (Fig. 5A), but this probably reflects defects in the testis sheath (data not shown) that are not found in the singly mutant males. Fig. 5.

Error bars indicate s.d. All genotypes are at least partially fertile. The large error bars in msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double mutants are due to high (40%) male death during the assay. Compare with Fig. 1F for wild-type male fertility levels. Centriolar-nuclear attachment is normal in elongating nuclei bundles from klarCD4 (B), msp300ΔKASH (C) and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 (D) mutant males as shown by tight juxtaposition of γ-tubulin staining (red) of the centriolar adjunct to the dent component of Yuri staining (green, see text, Fig. 6J and supplementary material Fig. S7). Scale bar: 10 μm.By contrast, both the male sterile phenotype of spag4 and the post-meiotic localization pattern of Spag4:6×MYC are compellingly similar to findings for a male sterile mutation of the yuri locus (yuriF64) and for Yuri nuclear localization (Texada et al., 2008). yuri is a complex locus encoding three major classes of ubiquitously expressed isoforms. The longer isoforms largely consist of coiled-coil regions. The yuriF64 mutation eliminates expression of the middle size Yuri isoforms globally, but, uniquely in the testis, the shortest isoform is also not expressed. This loss of two isoforms in the testis might explain the observation that the yuriF64 mutant exhibits male sterility, but no other developmental phenotype. An antibody that detects all isoforms showed Yuri accumulation in the postmeiotic nuclear cap, dent and stripe patterns exactly as described above for Spag4 and confirmed here by localization (Fig. 5B-D, Fig. 6) and colocalization (supplementary material Fig. S7) studies. In yuriF64, this nuclear localization of Yuri was absent and, as in the spag4-null, the centrioles lost their normal attachments to the post-meiotic nuclei and the NBs became disorganized, with nuclei forming curled, distorted shapes. Similar defects in late spermatogenesis were also shared by yuriF64 and spag4-null flies, including failure of actin cone formation and individualization, aberrant MD condensation, abortive coiling and absence of mature sperm in the seminal vesicle. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Spag4 and Yuri localize to nuclear envelopes, cap, BB dent and stripe during spermatogenesis. Spag4 and Yuri localization at the NE of primary spermatocytes (A,B), at the centriolar cap on round spermatids (C,D) and in the BB dent and stripe on elongating nuclei (E,F) are compellingly similar. F′ shows Yuri localization on a single elongate nucleus. In the spag4 mutant, Yuri fails to localize to the NE of primary spermatocytes (G) and to the centriolar cap (H) and the BB dent and stripe (I) at later stages. However, Yuri accumulates on the BB and overlays the CA (I). I′ also shows absence of Yuri stripe and Yuri accumulation on BB for a single nucleus. Upper arrows in F′, I′ show position of BB, lower arrows show position of stripe. Yuri accumulation on the centrioles of primary spermatocytes is also intermittently seen in the spag4 mutant (arrow, G). In yuriF64, most elements of the Spag4 localization pattern remain (J,K) but accumulation at the BB dent is lost (L). Control genotypes: in A, w;; spag4:gfp; in C,E, w;; spag4:6xmyc; in B,D,F,F′, w1118. Scale bars 25 μm (A,B,G,J), 15 μm (C,D,H,K), 10 μm (E), 6 μm (F,F′,I,I′,L).Although Yuri contains neither a transmembrane nor a KASH domain, these data clearly suggest that Spag4 and Yuri are components of the same pathway for centriolar-nuclear association. Furthermore, previous findings for cytoplasmic dynein suggest that it also has a role in this process (Li et al., 2004). Dynein accumulates in the cap pattern on round spermatid nuclei seen for Spag4:6×MYC and Yuri, and loss of this dynein cap in a null mutation of dynein light chain gene Dlc90F results in failure of centriole-nucleus association. We therefore investigated the interactions between these three components further. Interactions between spag4, yuri and dynein components As shown above, Spag4 accumulated on the NE of primary spermatocytes, and then decorated the spindle during meiosis. Yuri localization was not determined during these early stages previously (Texada et al., 2008), and was thus investigated as part of this work. We discovered that although Yuri was present on the primary spermatocyte NEs in some spermatocyte cysts (Fig. 6B), it was not present at all stages, suggesting that its presence there is regulated. On round spermatid nuclei, Yuri and Spag4 both formed centriolar caps (Fig. 6C,D), and the proteins colocalized to the stripe and dent in elongating spermatids (supplementary material Fig. S7; Fig. 6E,F,F′). In contrast to Spag4:6×MYC, Yuri was not detected on the meiotic spindles, and showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining during these divisions. However, Yuri was sometimes detected associated with the centrioles at the NE immediately before meiosis I (data not shown), and routinely Yuri localized to a circumferential ring on the single centrioles at the meiosis II spindle poles (supplementary material Fig. S8). In spag4-null flies, Yuri was never detected on the NE of primary spermatocytes, but now could be found on some of the V-shaped centriole pairs at the periphery of these cells (Fig. 6G). No obvious new localization of Yuri emerged during meiosis. But strikingly, the post-meiotic positioning of Yuri relative to the spermatid nuclei and centrioles was dramatically altered in the spag4 mutant. All elements of the usual nuclear pattern – the cap, dent and stripe – were lost (Fig. 6H,I), and at the onset of nuclear elongation, Yuri began to accumulate ectopically on the dissociating centrioles (Fig. 6I). During elongation, as the centrioles become BBs, the toroid-shaped centriolar adjunct (CA) develops around the rod-like core of the BB (Texada et al., 2008). γ-tubulin is confined to the CA and thus provides an excellent marker for these toroid structures. Using Yuri and γ-tubulin staining, we determined that Yuri not only accumulated on the rod of the BB proper but also frequently coated the outer surface of the CA (Fig. 6I′). Conversely, in the yuriF64 mutant, Spag4:6×MYC accumulation on the primary spermatocyte NEs, the meiotic spindles, and in the cap and stripe remained unaltered (Fig. 6J,K,L). However, one element of the Spag4 distribution pattern was lost: Spag4:6×MYC no longer accumulated at the dent representing the BB attachment site (Fig. 6L). Thus, with the exception of this site, the interactions between the two proteins are very similar to those predicted for a SUN-KASH protein pair. The effect of loss of the dynein cap at the round spermatid stage (in a Dlc90F-null mutant) on the nuclear location of Yuri was reported by Texada and co-workers (Texada et al., 2008). Notably, the effect is similar to that described here upon loss of Spag4: the Yuri cap is strongly reduced, the stripe and dent components never develop, and Yuri accumulates on the BB proper. Thus both spag4 and dynein have a role in positioning Yuri on the NE. That Yuri has no role in positioning dynein was determined by examining the location of p50:GFP, a tagged subunit of a dynactin, which is a well-established dynein interaction partner (Wojcik et al., 2001). p50:GFP shows identical localization to dynein at the nucleus and meiotic spindles during spermatogenesis (Li et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 2009), including accumulation in the cap on round spermatid nuclei. In the yuriF64 mutant, this localization pattern for p50:GFP on the spermatid nuclei remained unchanged (Fig. 7G). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Dynein-dynactin components require Spag4, but not Yuri, for localization during spermatogenesis. Spag4:6×MYC localization is essentially normal in (A) primary spermatocytes, (B) round spermatids and (C) elongating spermatids in the Dlc90Fe155 mutant background, although elongating nuclei fail to remain in register. Conversely, the p50:GFP dynactin subunit, which localizes to the centriolar cap on wild-type round spermatid nuclei (D-D″), fails to localize normally in the spag4-null mutant, aggregating instead on centrioles on round spermatid nuclei (E) and in puncta on the CAs of elongating nuclei (F). (G) Localization of p50:GFP to the centriolar cap is unaffected in the yuriF64 mutant. Scale bars: 25 μm (A), 10 μm (B-D′,F,G), 8 μm (E).Throughout spermatogenesis, Spag4:6×MYC localization was unaffected in the Dlc90Fe155-null mutant (Fig. 7A-C), indicating that dynein has no role in Spag4 positioning at the NE. But conversely, results for p50:GFP suggest that spag4 has a role in the localization of dynein-dynactin both before and after meiosis. In spag4-null primary spermatocytes, p50:GFP accumulation at the nuclear membrane was lost and instead, similarly to localization of Yuri, p50:GFP accumulated on the paired centrioles at the spermatocyte periphery (data not shown). Likewise, p50:GFP was not detected in the hemispherical cap on round spermatids in spag4-null flies, but again, similarly to Yuri in the spag4 mutant background, accumulated on the BB (Fig. 7E), However, at this stage, the p50:GFP accumulation pattern on the BB was distinct from that of Yuri. All of the p50:GFP was associated with the CA torus, upon which it formed a distinctive pattern of dots around the circumference of the structure (Fig. 7F). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to bring dynein-dynactin to the nuclear membrane, whereas Yuri, by contrast, requires dynein-dynactin for its accumulation there. A pathway in which the order of gene action is spag4-dynein-dynactin-yuri is thus in operation. This model suggests that Spag4 and dynein-dynactin, and Yuri and dynein-dynactin should be simultaneously present at the nuclear surface. Colocalization studies established that these pairs of proteins and all three components together could be detected simultaneously on primary spermatocyte and round spermatid nuclei (supplementary material Fig. S9).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Spag4 functions independently of a LINC complex In this study, we describe the role of Spag4, a Drosophila SUN protein. Spag4 is primarily required for linking the centriole and later the BB, two forms of the MTOC of the spermatid, to the nucleus of the elongating spermatid during spermatogenesis. In other contexts, KASH proteins are the essential partners of SUN proteins, forming LINC complexes that tether centrosomes to the NE. However, in single and double mutants of the two KASH protein genes of Drosophila lacking the KASH domain, centriole attachment to the spermatid nucleus is normal. Thus Spag4 appears to mediate this interaction by a mechanism that does not involve a typical LINC complex. Consistent with this notion, we have found that Spag4 localization on elongated spermatid nuclei is independent of lamin (supplementary material Fig. S10D), which in other contexts is essential for NE localization of LINC complexes. Dictyostelium discoideum cells lack a nuclear lamina, and the SUN protein Sun-1 is thought to interact with chromatin directly (Xiong et al., 2008). Mature sperm also lack a normal nuclear lamina, suggesting that Spag4 might also directly link to chromatin. These unusual features of Spag4 might partly reflect the highly specialized centriole-nuclear interaction that it facilitates. As the Drosophila spermatid centriole differentiates into the BB, complex structural rearrangements occur, followed in the final stages by altered relative positioning of the BB and the nucleus (Tokuyasu, 1974; Tokuyasu, 1975). Spag4 and Yuri are components of a postmeiotic pathway for maintaining the centriole at the spermatid nucleus In contrast to the KASH proteins, our studies have identified the coiled-coil protein Yuri as an essential component of the postmeiotic Spag4 centriole-tethering pathway. In the post-meiotic stages, Yuri shows identical nuclear positioning to Spag4, and Spag4 is essential for localization of Yuri to its various nuclear sites. These observations place Yuri downstream of Spag4 in the pathway. However, at the nuclear dent, in which the BB sits, there is mutual dependence between the two proteins for correct localization. In addition to this post-meiotic pathway, a pre-meiotic mechanism exists to bring the centriole pairs of the primary spermatocyte to the NE for function in meiosis. The gene asunder (asun) is required for this process, which involves accumulation of Asun itself, and Asun-dependent accumulation of dynein (and p50:GFP) at the primary spermatocyte NE (Anderson et al., 2009). As we show here, both Spag4 and Yuri also associate with the primary spermatocyte NE, with localization of Yuri there being Spag4-dependent. However, in contrast to an asun mutant, no defects in meiosis were found in yuriF64 or spag4-null spermatocytes. Thus, no immediate role for the two proteins in pre-meiotic centriole-nuclear association can be postulated. During meiosis, Spag4 is associated with the spindle and astral microtubules. Although a role for SUN proteins in tethering telomeres to the NE during meiosis has been described (Ding et al., 2007; Penkner et al., 2007), we could not detect altered telomere distribution in spag4-null meiosis (data not shown). The functions of Yuri and Spag4 in these early stages are thus obscure. Association of Spag4 with the spindle could simply represent a storage location. The interaction of Yuri and Spag4 in relation to nuclear membrane topology If Spag4 were a typical SUN protein, its transmembrane domain would traverse the INM, placing its C-terminus in the intermembrane space to interact with a KASH-domain protein spanning the ONM. However none of the isoforms of Yuri has either a transmembrane domain or KASH domain, indicating that a direct interaction between the two proteins in the intermembrane space is unlikely. Thus, despite our evidence that the two known Drosophila KASH proteins have no role here, it seems likely that some other ONM protein is needed to bring Yuri and Spag4 together. Our findings on the role of cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin also make a direct interaction of Yuri and Spag4 unlikely. The order of gene action in the pathway appears to be spag4–dynein-dynactin–yuri, again probably precluding a direct Spag4-Yuri interaction. Given these indications of indirect interaction, it is pertinent to ask where Yuri is localized relative to the NE. Previous EM studies (A. D. Tates, PhD thesis, Leiden University, 1971; Tokuyasu, 1974) have shown that the initial cap component of the dense complex forms in a tight compartment between the nuclear membranes proper and a layer of closely apposed ER tubule. In other tissues, we have established that Yuri shows a strong association with the ER rather than the nuclear membranes per se (Michael J. Texada, Rebecca A. Simonette and William J. Deery, unpublished results). It seems likely therefore that Yuri is not bound to the nuclear membranes, but rather is in close apposition to them through association with the overlying ER. If Spag4 is in the inner nuclear membrane, and Yuri in the overlying ER, several components, including an ONM protein and dynein-dynactin, probably link the two proteins. However, given its unusual interactions, Spag4 might not reside in the INM and thus fewer intermediates might be in play. Differing molecular activities at the dent and the stripe The pathway described above is adequate to address the relationship of Yuri and Spag4 at most elements of their nuclear-localization patterns. However, at the dent, further interactions must be invoked, because at this site, localization of the two proteins is mutually dependent. This role of Yuri in positioning Spag4 is unlikely to involve dynein-dynactin, because Yuri has no effect on the localization of p50:GFP(dynactin) at the nuclear surface. Thus additional molecular interactions must take place. Yuri has three isoforms, and it is possible that at this site, an isoform not active at the other locations is in operation (see further discussion below). Our antibody detects all Yuri isoforms, and thus provides no information on individual isoform location. The different molecular activities at the dent and stripe might reflect different roles for the proteins at these two locations. The dent is closely associated with the BB, and at this site the two proteins function in centriole retention and maturation. The stripe is far removed from this position, and it has been suggested that it might strengthen the nuclei along their long axes during elongation and chromatin condensation (Tokuyasu, 1974). Consistent with this possibility, in both the yuriF64 and the spag4 mutants, the fully elongated nuclei are frequently coiled and distorted along their long axis. The stripe contains microtubules, and interestingly, there is evidence that the stripe microtubules represent a distinct class of structures that do not originate from the BB (Tatsuhiko Noguchi, unpublished results). Similarities to the SUN1-ZYG-12 interaction pair – different roles for Yuri isoforms? In some ways Yuri is comparable with the KASH protein ZYG-12, which tethers the centrosome to the nucleus in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote by a mechanism involving dynein (Malone et al., 2003). Similarly to Yuri, ZYG-12 is a coiled-coil protein with three isoforms. Furthermore, the longer isoforms of Yuri contain a ~127 residue region with 24% identity and 46% similarity to the ZYG-12 isoforms (supplementary material Fig. S1B). The ZYG-12A isoform localizes to the centrosome, and the B and C isoforms localize to the NE. Direct interaction of the B and C isoforms with dynein leads to close association of the centrosome and nucleus, dimerization of B and C with the A variant, and formation of a stable centrosome-nucleus link. We detected association of Yuri with the centrioles during meiosis II, that is, immediately before Yuri begins to function in maintenance of post-meiotic centriole-nuclear attachment (supplementary material Fig. S8). Furthermore, we identified a role for dynein-dynactin in association of Yuri with the nuclear surface. Given these parallels with ZYG-12, it seems possible that the Yuri isoforms might show differential localization between the centriole and the nuclear surface, and that some Yuri isoforms interact directly with dynein. The overall similar behavior of p50:GFP and Yuri in the spag4 mutant supports the hypothesis of direct interaction with dynein, but at the same time indicates that Yuri is not directly associated with the dynactin component per se, because the precise localizations of Yuri and p50:GFP on the developing BB in the spag4-null mutant are distinctly different (compare Fig. 6I,I′ and Fig. 7F). Successful sperm individualization correlates with maintenance of the BB-nucleus link and with properly shaped and bundled elongated nuclei Mutations in yuri and spag4 result in dissociation of BBs from spermatid nuclei, subsequent curling of the elongate nuclei and finally, failure of individualization. Although BB behavior has not been examined for a mutation to Pros-α6T (a testis-specific proteasome subunit), nevertheless, curled, mislocalized spermatid nuclei are found in this mutant along with aberrant actin cone formation and failed individualization (Zhong and Belote, 2007). Therefore, results for spag4, yuri and Pros-α6T suggest that dissociation of BB from the nuclei and/or contortion of elongated nuclei correlate with failed IC formation and progression. How BB detachment from nuclei and nuclear contortion would affect formation of individual actin cones and progression of the IC is not apparent. One possibility is that components of the dense complex at the cap and/or stripe are requisite precursors for formation of actin cones. Actin cone formation begins with the deposition of F-actin filaments along the long axis of the nuclei (Noguchi et al., 2008). The dense complex materials at the cap and the stripe contain F-actin, and this F-actin is lost in yuriF64 (Texada et al., 2008). EM examination of the formation of F-actin filaments on the final nuclei of the spag4, yuriF64 and Pros-α6T mutants would address this issue. The male sterile mutation ms(3)72D also produces contorted spermatid nuclei (Castrillon et al., 1993) and might thus also be defective in BB-nuclear attachment, actin cone and IC formation, and sperm individualization. In summary, we have identified Spag4 as a component of a centriolar-nuclear attachment pathway in spermatogenesis that also requires the coiled-coil protein Yuri and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin. Although Spag4 is a SUN protein, its action in this pathway appears not to involve a conventional KASH protein. The disruption of the later stages of spermatogenesis in yuri and spag4 mutants might be secondary to the general disruption of events at the spermatid nuclear surface produced in these mutants.",

Copyright notice ID: 2915878 PMID: 20647369 Abstract Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface. Keywords: KASH protein, SUN protein, Centrosome, Centriole, Coiled-coil proteins, Sperm basal body, SpermatogenesisIntroduction Within eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999; Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994; Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999; Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005; Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes. Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC-Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Starr and Fischer, 2005; Crisp et al., 2006; Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006; Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002; Hodzic et al., 2004; King et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002; Zhang et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2004; Wilhelmsen et al., 2005; Ketema et al., 2007). A detailed model for the mechanism by which the Caenorhabditis elegans KASH protein ZYG-12 links the zygotic centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE) has been proposed (Malone et al., 2003), which involves direct interaction of certain ZYG-12 isoforms with the microtubule motor dynein. The Drosophila genome encodes two KASH protein genes, klarsicht (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999) and msp-300 (Zhang et al., 2002) and two SUN protein genes, klaroid (Kracklauer et al., 2007) and gene CG6589. CG6589, previously termed giacomo, has proved to have sequence homology to the testis-specific mammalian SUN protein Spag4 (Shao et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2004) (supplementary material Fig. S1) and thus we have re-named the gene spag4. We show here that Spag4 has a crucial role in spermatogenesis comparable to that of other SUN proteins: it is necessary for anchoring the centriole or basal body (BB) to the spermatid nucleus. But surprisingly, this role does not require formation of a typical LINC complex with a KASH protein. Instead, we have shown that the coiled-coil cytoplasmic protein Yuri Gagarin (Armstrong et al., 2006; Texada et al., 2008) is an essential component of the Spag4-BB anchoring mechanism, and that regulation of dynein-dynactin localization by Spag4 has a role in the process.Results Spliced spag4 mRNA is found only in testes and encodes a transmembrane domain protein We first analyzed the expression of spag4 mRNA by RT-PCR, and observed that spliced mRNA is found only in male larvae, pupae and adults (Fig. 1A), suggesting testis-specific expression. Expression of spag4 mRNA characterized at www.flyatlas.org confirms this testis specificity. In situ hybridization demonstrated that spag4 mRNA expression peaks in the early primary spermatocyte region of adult testes (Fig. 1B). Low levels of the unspliced precursor transcript were observed in females (Fig. 1A), but appear to be functionless given the viability and fertility of spag4-null females (see below). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab spag4 expression, spag4 knockout and fertility assays.

Blue bars, males; pink bars, females.Although all SUN proteins described to date have a transmembrane (TM) domain N-terminal to the SUN domain (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995; Malone et al., 1999; Shao et al., 1999; Dreger et al., 2001; Malone et al., 2003; Hodzic et al., 2004; Kracklauer et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007), the originally annotated Spag4 protein sequence contains no TM domain (Tweedie et al., 2009). Using 5′ RNA-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE), we identified 5′ spag4 mRNA sequences encoding an N-terminus with a single TM helix (Fig. 1C). 3′ RACE also revealed a previously uncharacterized 3′ UTR. The corrected spag4 gene region spans ~1.2 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1C). spag4 mutant males are sterile To determine the function of spag4, we generated knockout mutations by ends-out homologous recombination (Fig. 1D,E, and Materials and Methods). Homozygous mutant individuals developed normally, yielding adults that were wild type in appearance. However, mutant males [either homozygous or in trans to deficiency Df(2L)Prl] were completely sterile (Fig. 1F). spag4-null males courted, mounted and copulated with females (data not shown), suggesting that male sterility is not a behavioral defect. Mutant females were fertile, consistent with a lack of spag4 mRNA splicing in females. Male fertility was restored to spag4 mutants by introducing a single copy of a 4.9 kb genomic spag4 transgene (Fig. 1F and supplementary material Fig. S3). A transgene generating Spag4 protein lacking the SUN domain (supplementary material Fig. S3) did not restore fertility to spag4-null males (Fig. 1F), indicating that Spag4 requires this domain for its role in spermatogenesis.Dynamic Spag4 subcellular localization during gametogenesis To address how Spag4 contributes to male gametogenesis, we examined protein localization in the testis using flies expressing Spag4 tagged C-terminally with 6×MYC or GFP. Transgenes similar to the spag4 rescue construct containing these tags (supplementary material Fig. S3) restored fertility to spag4 males, indicating that the tagged genes have wild-type function and that the tagged proteins are likely to localize normally. All independent insertions of both transgenes produced identical localization patterns. In general, Spag4:6×MYC gave stronger signals, but for mature sperm in the seminal vesicle, the Spag4:GFP signal was more robust (Fig. 2J). Most data shown here derives from Spag4:6×MYC. Fig. 2.

A concentration of Spag4:6×MYC at the apical tip of elongating spermatid nuclei (H,I′) is shown by the basal body marker YFP:Asl (I) to lie between the BB and the nuclei proper (I″). This Spag4:6×MYC focus persists on mature sperm in the seminal vesicle (J), similarly to the BB marker YFP:Asl (K).

Scale bars: 150 μm (A), 20 μm (B-G,J,K) and 10 μm (H,I).In the Drosophila testis, germ cells are arranged in a spatio-temporal order, from the apical tip to the basal seminal vesicle. Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, Spag4:6×MYC was not detectable at the apical tip, where germ-line stem cells and spermatogonia reside (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2A). Four rounds of synchronous divisions yield 16 interconnected spermatogonia, encapsulated in a cyst. These spermatogonia become spermatocytes and commit to meiosis, resulting in 64 interconnected round spermatids. Spag4:6×MYC was first detected in primary spermatocytes where it was associated closely with the NE, as demonstrated by colocalization with lamin (supplementary material Fig. S4D-F). Spag4:6×MYC remained at the NE as nuclei became grooved and lobular during primary spermatocyte growth (Fig. 2B). Upon NE breakdown, Spag4:6×MYC colocalized with subsets of microtubules in the meiosis I spindles (Fig. 2C; supplementary material Fig. S4A-C), and possibly the parafusorial membranes (Fuller, 1993). In late meiosis II, Spag4:6×MYC again associated with spindle microtubules (supplementary material Fig. S4A′-C′) cupping the astral region of re-forming nuclei (Fig. 2D). As post-meiotic round spermatids formed, Spag4:6×MYC once again localized to the NE (Fig. 2E). Once meiosis is complete, the single centriole of each round spermatid attaches to its nuclear surface, and dramatic morphological changes commence. The centriole differentiates into the BB, from which the axoneme develops, and the nuclei elongate and condense to a needle-like shape. The Spag4:6×MYC protein at the NE initially transformed into a hemispherical cap (the ‘cap’) with the centriole at its apex (Fig. 2F). Subsequently, on the elongating nuclei, Spag4:6×MYC assumed a two-component pattern, with a focus of the protein at the centriole or BB attachment site, and a stripe of protein along the long axis of the nuclei (the ‘stripe’). From EM studies, Tokuyasu (Tokuyasu, 1974) identified electron-dense material, termed the dense complex, which initially formed as a pericentriolar hemispherical cap on round spermatid nuclei and was later present as a stripe rich in microtubules along the length of the elongating nuclei. That the stripe of Spag4:6×MYC is at the position of the dense complex was established by colocalization in testes expressing α-tubulin:GFP (Fig. 2G-G″). As elongation proceeded, the Spag4:6×MYC stripe along the dense complex gradually disappeared, and the focus at the BB became more compact and assumed a distinctive trefoil or bell shape (Fig. 2H). As shown by colocalization with the pancentriolar marker YFP:Asl (Varmark et al., 2007) (Fig. 2I-I″), this focus of Spag4 protein was between the caudal nuclear tip and BB, thus placing it at the ~0.5 μm indentation (the ‘dent’) in the nucleus in which the BB sits (Tokuyasu, 1975). Spag4:GFP persisted on sperm nuclei in the seminal vesicle (Fig. 2J), as did YFP:Asl (Fig. 2K), suggesting that Spag4 remains at the BB attachment site in mature sperm. This dynamic pattern of Spag4 localization is unusual; other SUN proteins localize specifically to the NE (Malone et al., 1999; Malone et al., 2003; Hodzic et al., 2004; Kracklauer et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007), microtubules (Shao et al., 1999) or the MTOC or SPB (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995; Xiong et al., 2008). However, this range of localizations for Spag4 might be more a property of the developmental process in question rather than the protein. So far, other SUN proteins have been studied in less complex developmental situations.The initial defect in spag4 mutant males is failure of centriole-nuclear attachment To address the role of Spag4 during sperm development, we analyzed spermatogenesis in the spag4-null mutant. Our goal was to identify the first detectable defects caused by the mutation, because later problems might be secondary to these initial failures. Despite the association of Spag4 with the NE of the primary spermatocyte, in the spag4 mutant, the primary spermatocyte stage appeared similar to the wild type (Fig. 3A,D). However, beginning in the round spermatid stage, some disruption of the centriole linkage was detectable (Fig. 3B,E), which became pronounced and fully penetrant as the nuclei condensed and elongated. In contrast to the wild type (Fig. 3C), in all elongate spag4 mutant nuclear bundles examined, BBs labelled with YFP:Asl had lost their normal association with the caudal nuclear tips and were scattered along the nuclear bundles (NBs) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, every NB observed showed some degree of dispersion within the cysts, and the scattered nuclei frequently curled in the terminal region of the testis (Fig. 3H). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to maintain the correct centriole-nuclear association, and has a role in shaping elongated nuclei. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Nuclear-centriolar dissociation during elongation stages is the earliest visible defect in spag4 mutant testes. Centriolar association with primary spermatocyte (A), round spermatid (B) and elongating (C) nuclei in wild-type testes. In spag4 mutant testes, centriolar association is normal in primary spermatocytes (D) and mostly normal in round spermatids (E), and early elongating spermatids (F). (G) Fully penetrant nuclear-centriolar dissociation becomes apparent in later elongation stages. (H) Nuclei contort in advanced elongation stages. (I) The microtubules of the dense complex stripe are retained on spag4 spermatid nuclei. Scale bars: 20 μm (A,D), 10 μm (B,C,E,I) and 15 μm (F,G,H).Later defects in spag4 mutant spermatogenesis In wild-type males, the seminal vesicle fills with mature sperm after several days of sequestration away from females. By contrast, no mature sperm accumulated in the seminal vesicles of sequestered spag4 mutant males (supplementary material Fig. S5), suggesting that developmental processes subsequent to BB-nuclear interaction also fail in the mutant. We thus investigated events during individualization, the process immediately following elongation. During individualization, elongated, syncytially connected spermatids are separated into individual sperm. An individualization complex (IC) composed of 64 actin cones that assemble around individual sperm nuclei forms, and then moves along the cyst towards the caudal ends of the spermatids (Hicks et al., 1999; Noguchi and Miller, 2003; Noguchi et al., 2008). As the IC moves along the cyst, each spermatid becomes surrounded by plasma membrane, and excess cytoplasm is pushed as a cytoplasmic bulge to the caudal tip of the cyst to form a ‘waste bag’. Using TEM to analyze cross-sections of testes, we found that spag4 mutants had defective individualization. In the wild type, cross-sections reveal an iterative pattern of individualized spermatids, each with a single axoneme and major and minor mitochondrial derivative (MD) surrounded by plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). In spag4 mutant cysts, arrays of axonemes each associated with a single major and minor MD were also seen (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, although axoneme structure was not analyzed in detail, it appeared grossly normal, with a small number of axonemes lacking the central microtubule doublets (typically less than 10 axonemes/cyst). However, both MDs showed failure to condense fully, a problem that was most marked for the minor MD. But most strikingly, plasma membrane investment largely failed to occur (Fig. 4D,E) and copious amounts of cytoplasm remained in the mutant cysts (Fig. 4E). Thus, sperm individualization and cytoplasmic elimination are severely affected in the spag4 mutant. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Individualization fails in the spag4 mutant testes. (A) Normal actin cones of the individualization complex (IC) form on wild-type elongated nuclei. (B) Abnormal actin deposition forms aberrant ICs in the spag4 mutant. (C) Lack of actin deposition on curled nuclei in the spag4 mutant. (D) TEM of wild-type elongated cyst cross-section. Black lines denote axis through the central doublet of the axoneme; within a wild-type cyst, spermatid cross-sections (red lines) lie at a constant angle (clockwise 45° to the central doublet. (E) In spag4 mutant cysts, aberrant angles demonstrate spermatid-axoneme misalignment. Red arrowhead indicates missing central doublet in spag4 axoneme. Images in D and E were taken in comparable regions of wild-type and mutant testes (towards terminal epithelium, immediately apical to cyst coiling region). Black arrows indicate major mitochondrial derivatives (MDs) and white arrows, minor MDs. Black arrowhead in D indicates plasma membrane. Both major and minor MDs are less condensed in spag4 mutant than in the wild type, and large regions of ribosome-rich cytoplasm persist in the cysts (blue dotted line). Scale bars: ~10 μm (A-C), 500 nm (D,E).A spatially controlled caspase cascade used in a non-apoptotic context promotes spermatid individualization (Huh et al., 2004; Muro et al., 2006). We found that caspase activation, as monitored with an antibody (anti-CM1) that recognizes the active form of the Drosophila effector caspase Ice (Arama et al., 2003; Muro et al., 2006; Zhong and Belote, 2007), was similar in spag4 mutant and wild-type testes (supplementary material Fig. S6A-B′). Successful activation of caspase was further confirmed by staining testes with Acridine Orange, a dye taken up by cysts undergoing individualization. (supplementary material Fig. S6A″,B″) (Arama and Steller, 2006). Thus, defective individualization in the mutant is not due to defective caspase activation. Instead, the defects appear to originate in aberrant formation of ICs. In the spag4 mutant, the individual actin cones were disrupted, with cones no longer forming organized ICs (Fig. 4A,B). In bundles of contorted nuclei, actin cones were often missing altogether (Fig. 4C). The disorganized ICs tended not to progress caudally, and mutant testes lacked cytoplasmic bulges and waste bags, indicating failures in individualization (supplementary material Fig. S6). Despite failed individualization, the elongated syncytial cysts in spag4 mutants attempted the final coiling process that precedes sperm movement into the seminal vesicle: the terminal region of mutant testes thus filled with coiling cysts (supplementary material Fig. S5D).Phenotype comparisons suggest interactions with yuri and dynein-dynactin but not known KASH proteins spag4 encodes a SUN protein and localizes to the NE during most of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the SUN domain is essential for the role of spag4 in male fertility (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that Spag4 functions as a typical SUN protein, forming a LINC complex with a KASH protein partner. However, our data indicate that neither of the two Drosophila KASH proteins (Klarsicht and MSP-300) is a Spag4 partner in the testis. For both genes, mutations that eliminate the KASH domain are available: msp300ΔKASH was generated by ends-out recombination (Xie and Fischer, 2008) and the klarCD4 mutation came from EMS mutagenesis that generated a suitably positioned stop codon (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2005). Mutant males of both genotypes were fertile (Fig. 5A) and in all cysts examined for msp300ΔKASH males, klarCD4 males and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double-mutant males, (44-95 cysts in 10 testes per genotype), the centrioles remained associated with the spermatid nuclei during elongation (Fig. 5B-D) and nuclear bundling, IC formation and IC progression were normal. There was no heterozygous effect of the spag4-null genotype on the fertility of klarCD4 mutant males (Fig. 5A) and the only aberrancy detected in the spermatid cysts of these various genotypes was the occasional apical mislocalization of nuclear bundles in klarCD4 and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double-mutant males (data not shown). The doubly mutant males were somewhat subfertile (Fig. 5A), but this probably reflects defects in the testis sheath (data not shown) that are not found in the singly mutant males. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Linking the spermatid nucleus to the centriole or BB does not require a KASH domain protein. (A) Fertility assays for KASH-domain protein alleles. n=20 for each genotype. Error bars indicate s.d. All genotypes are at least partially fertile. The large error bars in msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 double mutants are due to high (40%) male death during the assay. Compare with Fig. 1F for wild-type male fertility levels. Centriolar-nuclear attachment is normal in elongating nuclei bundles from klarCD4 (B), msp300ΔKASH (C) and msp300ΔKASH; klarCD4 (D) mutant males as shown by tight juxtaposition of γ-tubulin staining (red) of the centriolar adjunct to the dent component of Yuri staining (green, see text, Fig. 6J and supplementary material Fig. S7). Scale bar: 10 μm.By contrast, both the male sterile phenotype of spag4 and the post-meiotic localization pattern of Spag4:6×MYC are compellingly similar to findings for a male sterile mutation of the yuri locus (yuriF64) and for Yuri nuclear localization (Texada et al., 2008). yuri is a complex locus encoding three major classes of ubiquitously expressed isoforms. The longer isoforms largely consist of coiled-coil regions. The yuriF64 mutation eliminates expression of the middle size Yuri isoforms globally, but, uniquely in the testis, the shortest isoform is also not expressed. This loss of two isoforms in the testis might explain the observation that the yuriF64 mutant exhibits male sterility, but no other developmental phenotype. An antibody that detects all isoforms showed Yuri accumulation in the postmeiotic nuclear cap, dent and stripe patterns exactly as described above for Spag4 and confirmed here by localization (Fig. 5B-D, Fig. 6) and colocalization (supplementary material Fig. S7) studies. In yuriF64, this nuclear localization of Yuri was absent and, as in the spag4-null, the centrioles lost their normal attachments to the post-meiotic nuclei and the NBs became disorganized, with nuclei forming curled, distorted shapes. Similar defects in late spermatogenesis were also shared by yuriF64 and spag4-null flies, including failure of actin cone formation and individualization, aberrant MD condensation, abortive coiling and absence of mature sperm in the seminal vesicle. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Spag4 and Yuri localize to nuclear envelopes, cap, BB dent and stripe during spermatogenesis. Spag4 and Yuri localization at the NE of primary spermatocytes (A,B), at the centriolar cap on round spermatids (C,D) and in the BB dent and stripe on elongating nuclei (E,F) are compellingly similar. F′ shows Yuri localization on a single elongate nucleus. In the spag4 mutant, Yuri fails to localize to the NE of primary spermatocytes (G) and to the centriolar cap (H) and the BB dent and stripe (I) at later stages. However, Yuri accumulates on the BB and overlays the CA (I). I′ also shows absence of Yuri stripe and Yuri accumulation on BB for a single nucleus. Upper arrows in F′, I′ show position of BB, lower arrows show position of stripe. Yuri accumulation on the centrioles of primary spermatocytes is also intermittently seen in the spag4 mutant (arrow, G). In yuriF64, most elements of the Spag4 localization pattern remain (J,K) but accumulation at the BB dent is lost (L). Control genotypes: in A, w;; spag4:gfp; in C,E, w;; spag4:6xmyc; in B,D,F,F′, w1118. Scale bars 25 μm (A,B,G,J), 15 μm (C,D,H,K), 10 μm (E), 6 μm (F,F′,I,I′,L).Although Yuri contains neither a transmembrane nor a KASH domain, these data clearly suggest that Spag4 and Yuri are components of the same pathway for centriolar-nuclear association. Furthermore, previous findings for cytoplasmic dynein suggest that it also has a role in this process (Li et al., 2004). Dynein accumulates in the cap pattern on round spermatid nuclei seen for Spag4:6×MYC and Yuri, and loss of this dynein cap in a null mutation of dynein light chain gene Dlc90F results in failure of centriole-nucleus association. We therefore investigated the interactions between these three components further.Interactions between spag4, yuri and dynein components As shown above, Spag4 accumulated on the NE of primary spermatocytes, and then decorated the spindle during meiosis. Yuri localization was not determined during these early stages previously (Texada et al., 2008), and was thus investigated as part of this work. We discovered that although Yuri was present on the primary spermatocyte NEs in some spermatocyte cysts (Fig. 6B), it was not present at all stages, suggesting that its presence there is regulated. On round spermatid nuclei, Yuri and Spag4 both formed centriolar caps (Fig. 6C,D), and the proteins colocalized to the stripe and dent in elongating spermatids (supplementary material Fig. S7; Fig. 6E,F,F′). In contrast to Spag4:6×MYC, Yuri was not detected on the meiotic spindles, and showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining during these divisions. However, Yuri was sometimes detected associated with the centrioles at the NE immediately before meiosis I (data not shown), and routinely Yuri localized to a circumferential ring on the single centrioles at the meiosis II spindle poles (supplementary material Fig. S8). In spag4-null flies, Yuri was never detected on the NE of primary spermatocytes, but now could be found on some of the V-shaped centriole pairs at the periphery of these cells (Fig. 6G). No obvious new localization of Yuri emerged during meiosis. But strikingly, the post-meiotic positioning of Yuri relative to the spermatid nuclei and centrioles was dramatically altered in the spag4 mutant. All elements of the usual nuclear pattern – the cap, dent and stripe – were lost (Fig. 6H,I), and at the onset of nuclear elongation, Yuri began to accumulate ectopically on the dissociating centrioles (Fig. 6I). During elongation, as the centrioles become BBs, the toroid-shaped centriolar adjunct (CA) develops around the rod-like core of the BB (Texada et al., 2008). γ-tubulin is confined to the CA and thus provides an excellent marker for these toroid structures. Using Yuri and γ-tubulin staining, we determined that Yuri not only accumulated on the rod of the BB proper but also frequently coated the outer surface of the CA (Fig. 6I′). Conversely, in the yuriF64 mutant, Spag4:6×MYC accumulation on the primary spermatocyte NEs, the meiotic spindles, and in the cap and stripe remained unaltered (Fig. 6J,K,L). However, one element of the Spag4 distribution pattern was lost: Spag4:6×MYC no longer accumulated at the dent representing the BB attachment site (Fig. 6L). Thus, with the exception of this site, the interactions between the two proteins are very similar to those predicted for a SUN-KASH protein pair. The effect of loss of the dynein cap at the round spermatid stage (in a Dlc90F-null mutant) on the nuclear location of Yuri was reported by Texada and co-workers (Texada et al., 2008). Notably, the effect is similar to that described here upon loss of Spag4: the Yuri cap is strongly reduced, the stripe and dent components never develop, and Yuri accumulates on the BB proper. Thus both spag4 and dynein have a role in positioning Yuri on the NE. That Yuri has no role in positioning dynein was determined by examining the location of p50:GFP, a tagged subunit of a dynactin, which is a well-established dynein interaction partner (Wojcik et al., 2001). p50:GFP shows identical localization to dynein at the nucleus and meiotic spindles during spermatogenesis (Li et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 2009), including accumulation in the cap on round spermatid nuclei. In the yuriF64 mutant, this localization pattern for p50:GFP on the spermatid nuclei remained unchanged (Fig. 7G). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Dynein-dynactin components require Spag4, but not Yuri, for localization during spermatogenesis. Spag4:6×MYC localization is essentially normal in (A) primary spermatocytes, (B) round spermatids and (C) elongating spermatids in the Dlc90Fe155 mutant background, although elongating nuclei fail to remain in register. Conversely, the p50:GFP dynactin subunit, which localizes to the centriolar cap on wild-type round spermatid nuclei (D-D″), fails to localize normally in the spag4-null mutant, aggregating instead on centrioles on round spermatid nuclei (E) and in puncta on the CAs of elongating nuclei (F). (G) Localization of p50:GFP to the centriolar cap is unaffected in the yuriF64 mutant. Scale bars: 25 μm (A), 10 μm (B-D′,F,G), 8 μm (E).Throughout spermatogenesis, Spag4:6×MYC localization was unaffected in the Dlc90Fe155-null mutant (Fig. 7A-C), indicating that dynein has no role in Spag4 positioning at the NE. But conversely, results for p50:GFP suggest that spag4 has a role in the localization of dynein-dynactin both before and after meiosis. In spag4-null primary spermatocytes, p50:GFP accumulation at the nuclear membrane was lost and instead, similarly to localization of Yuri, p50:GFP accumulated on the paired centrioles at the spermatocyte periphery (data not shown). Likewise, p50:GFP was not detected in the hemispherical cap on round spermatids in spag4-null flies, but again, similarly to Yuri in the spag4 mutant background, accumulated on the BB (Fig. 7E), However, at this stage, the p50:GFP accumulation pattern on the BB was distinct from that of Yuri. All of the p50:GFP was associated with the CA torus, upon which it formed a distinctive pattern of dots around the circumference of the structure (Fig. 7F). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to bring dynein-dynactin to the nuclear membrane, whereas Yuri, by contrast, requires dynein-dynactin for its accumulation there. A pathway in which the order of gene action is spag4-dynein-dynactin-yuri is thus in operation. This model suggests that Spag4 and dynein-dynactin, and Yuri and dynein-dynactin should be simultaneously present at the nuclear surface. Colocalization studies established that these pairs of proteins and all three components together could be detected simultaneously on primary spermatocyte and round spermatid nuclei (supplementary material Fig. S9).Discussion Spag4 functions independently of a LINC complex In this study, we describe the role of Spag4, a Drosophila SUN protein. Spag4 is primarily required for linking the centriole and later the BB, two forms of the MTOC of the spermatid, to the nucleus of the elongating spermatid during spermatogenesis. In other contexts, KASH proteins are the essential partners of SUN proteins, forming LINC complexes that tether centrosomes to the NE. However, in single and double mutants of the two KASH protein genes of Drosophila lacking the KASH domain, centriole attachment to the spermatid nucleus is normal. Thus Spag4 appears to mediate this interaction by a mechanism that does not involve a typical LINC complex. Consistent with this notion, we have found that Spag4 localization on elongated spermatid nuclei is independent of lamin (supplementary material Fig. S10D), which in other contexts is essential for NE localization of LINC complexes. Dictyostelium discoideum cells lack a nuclear lamina, and the SUN protein Sun-1 is thought to interact with chromatin directly (Xiong et al., 2008). Mature sperm also lack a normal nuclear lamina, suggesting that Spag4 might also directly link to chromatin. These unusual features of Spag4 might partly reflect the highly specialized centriole-nuclear interaction that it facilitates. As the Drosophila spermatid centriole differentiates into the BB, complex structural rearrangements occur, followed in the final stages by altered relative positioning of the BB and the nucleus (Tokuyasu, 1974; Tokuyasu, 1975).Spag4 and Yuri are components of a postmeiotic pathway for maintaining the centriole at the spermatid nucleus In contrast to the KASH proteins, our studies have identified the coiled-coil protein Yuri as an essential component of the postmeiotic Spag4 centriole-tethering pathway. In the post-meiotic stages, Yuri shows identical nuclear positioning to Spag4, and Spag4 is essential for localization of Yuri to its various nuclear sites. These observations place Yuri downstream of Spag4 in the pathway. However, at the nuclear dent, in which the BB sits, there is mutual dependence between the two proteins for correct localization. In addition to this post-meiotic pathway, a pre-meiotic mechanism exists to bring the centriole pairs of the primary spermatocyte to the NE for function in meiosis. The gene asunder (asun) is required for this process, which involves accumulation of Asun itself, and Asun-dependent accumulation of dynein (and p50:GFP) at the primary spermatocyte NE (Anderson et al., 2009). As we show here, both Spag4 and Yuri also associate with the primary spermatocyte NE, with localization of Yuri there being Spag4-dependent. However, in contrast to an asun mutant, no defects in meiosis were found in yuriF64 or spag4-null spermatocytes. Thus, no immediate role for the two proteins in pre-meiotic centriole-nuclear association can be postulated. During meiosis, Spag4 is associated with the spindle and astral microtubules. Although a role for SUN proteins in tethering telomeres to the NE during meiosis has been described (Ding et al., 2007; Penkner et al., 2007), we could not detect altered telomere distribution in spag4-null meiosis (data not shown). The functions of Yuri and Spag4 in these early stages are thus obscure. Association of Spag4 with the spindle could simply represent a storage location.The interaction of Yuri and Spag4 in relation to nuclear membrane topology If Spag4 were a typical SUN protein, its transmembrane domain would traverse the INM, placing its C-terminus in the intermembrane space to interact with a KASH-domain protein spanning the ONM. However none of the isoforms of Yuri has either a transmembrane domain or KASH domain, indicating that a direct interaction between the two proteins in the intermembrane space is unlikely. Thus, despite our evidence that the two known Drosophila KASH proteins have no role here, it seems likely that some other ONM protein is needed to bring Yuri and Spag4 together. Our findings on the role of cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin also make a direct interaction of Yuri and Spag4 unlikely. The order of gene action in the pathway appears to be spag4–dynein-dynactin–yuri, again probably precluding a direct Spag4-Yuri interaction. Given these indications of indirect interaction, it is pertinent to ask where Yuri is localized relative to the NE. Previous EM studies (A. D. Tates, PhD thesis, Leiden University, 1971; Tokuyasu, 1974) have shown that the initial cap component of the dense complex forms in a tight compartment between the nuclear membranes proper and a layer of closely apposed ER tubule. In other tissues, we have established that Yuri shows a strong association with the ER rather than the nuclear membranes per se (Michael J. Texada, Rebecca A. Simonette and William J. Deery, unpublished results). It seems likely therefore that Yuri is not bound to the nuclear membranes, but rather is in close apposition to them through association with the overlying ER. If Spag4 is in the inner nuclear membrane, and Yuri in the overlying ER, several components, including an ONM protein and dynein-dynactin, probably link the two proteins. However, given its unusual interactions, Spag4 might not reside in the INM and thus fewer intermediates might be in play.Differing molecular activities at the dent and the stripe The pathway described above is adequate to address the relationship of Yuri and Spag4 at most elements of their nuclear-localization patterns. However, at the dent, further interactions must be invoked, because at this site, localization of the two proteins is mutually dependent. This role of Yuri in positioning Spag4 is unlikely to involve dynein-dynactin, because Yuri has no effect on the localization of p50:GFP(dynactin) at the nuclear surface. Thus additional molecular interactions must take place. Yuri has three isoforms, and it is possible that at this site, an isoform not active at the other locations is in operation (see further discussion below). Our antibody detects all Yuri isoforms, and thus provides no information on individual isoform location. The different molecular activities at the dent and stripe might reflect different roles for the proteins at these two locations. The dent is closely associated with the BB, and at this site the two proteins function in centriole retention and maturation. The stripe is far removed from this position, and it has been suggested that it might strengthen the nuclei along their long axes during elongation and chromatin condensation (Tokuyasu, 1974). Consistent with this possibility, in both the yuriF64 and the spag4 mutants, the fully elongated nuclei are frequently coiled and distorted along their long axis. The stripe contains microtubules, and interestingly, there is evidence that the stripe microtubules represent a distinct class of structures that do not originate from the BB (Tatsuhiko Noguchi, unpublished results).Similarities to the SUN1-ZYG-12 interaction pair – different roles for Yuri isoforms? In some ways Yuri is comparable with the KASH protein ZYG-12, which tethers the centrosome to the nucleus in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote by a mechanism involving dynein (Malone et al., 2003). Similarly to Yuri, ZYG-12 is a coiled-coil protein with three isoforms. Furthermore, the longer isoforms of Yuri contain a ~127 residue region with 24% identity and 46% similarity to the ZYG-12 isoforms (supplementary material Fig. S1B). The ZYG-12A isoform localizes to the centrosome, and the B and C isoforms localize to the NE. Direct interaction of the B and C isoforms with dynein leads to close association of the centrosome and nucleus, dimerization of B and C with the A variant, and formation of a stable centrosome-nucleus link. We detected association of Yuri with the centrioles during meiosis II, that is, immediately before Yuri begins to function in maintenance of post-meiotic centriole-nuclear attachment (supplementary material Fig. S8). Furthermore, we identified a role for dynein-dynactin in association of Yuri with the nuclear surface. Given these parallels with ZYG-12, it seems possible that the Yuri isoforms might show differential localization between the centriole and the nuclear surface, and that some Yuri isoforms interact directly with dynein. The overall similar behavior of p50:GFP and Yuri in the spag4 mutant supports the hypothesis of direct interaction with dynein, but at the same time indicates that Yuri is not directly associated with the dynactin component per se, because the precise localizations of Yuri and p50:GFP on the developing BB in the spag4-null mutant are distinctly different (compare Fig. 6I,I′ and Fig. 7F).Successful sperm individualization correlates with maintenance of the BB-nucleus link and with properly shaped and bundled elongated nuclei Mutations in yuri and spag4 result in dissociation of BBs from spermatid nuclei, subsequent curling of the elongate nuclei and finally, failure of individualization. Although BB behavior has not been examined for a mutation to Pros-α6T (a testis-specific proteasome subunit), nevertheless, curled, mislocalized spermatid nuclei are found in this mutant along with aberrant actin cone formation and failed individualization (Zhong and Belote, 2007). Therefore, results for spag4, yuri and Pros-α6T suggest that dissociation of BB from the nuclei and/or contortion of elongated nuclei correlate with failed IC formation and progression. How BB detachment from nuclei and nuclear contortion would affect formation of individual actin cones and progression of the IC is not apparent. One possibility is that components of the dense complex at the cap and/or stripe are requisite precursors for formation of actin cones. Actin cone formation begins with the deposition of F-actin filaments along the long axis of the nuclei (Noguchi et al., 2008). The dense complex materials at the cap and the stripe contain F-actin, and this F-actin is lost in yuriF64 (Texada et al., 2008). EM examination of the formation of F-actin filaments on the final nuclei of the spag4, yuriF64 and Pros-α6T mutants would address this issue. The male sterile mutation ms(3)72D also produces contorted spermatid nuclei (Castrillon et al., 1993) and might thus also be defective in BB-nuclear attachment, actin cone and IC formation, and sperm individualization. In summary, we have identified Spag4 as a component of a centriolar-nuclear attachment pathway in spermatogenesis that also requires the coiled-coil protein Yuri and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin. Although Spag4 is a SUN protein, its action in this pathway appears not to involve a conventional KASH protein. The disruption of the later stages of spermatogenesis in yuri and spag4 mutants might be secondary to the general disruption of events at the spermatid nuclear surface produced in these mutants.Materials and Methods Drosophila stocks Transgenic lines were prepared by standard methods at UT Austin or at Genetic Services (Sudbury, MA). Standard genetic crosses were used to introduce: (1) transgenes pC4-spag4, pC4-spag4:gfp, pC4-spag4:6xmyc, pC4-spag4-SUNstop and p50:GFP into the background of spag4-knockout allele #6 and (2) pC4-spag4:6xmyc and p50:GFP into the yuriF64 background. p50:GFP and Dlc90Fe155/TMB Tb were obtained from Thomas Hays, University of Minnesota, MN, USA. w, αTub:gfp, w, yfp:asl lines (Rebollo et al., 2004; Varmark et al., 2007) and the deficiency spanning spag4 Df(2L)Prl, were obtained from Cayetano Gonzalez, Institute for Research and Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain and the Drosophila Stock Center (Bloomington), respectively.Molecular biology Molecular biology manipulations were performed using standard techniques. Unless specified, SuperScript II RT reagents and Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used, and primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer sequences are provided in supplementary material Fig. S2. DNA sequencing was performed at the UT Austin ICMB Core Facility.Expression analysis of spag4 Total RNA from ten male or female larvae, pupae and adults was isolated and treated with DNase I, as described (Kracklauer et al., 2007). RT was performed using an oligo (dT) primer followed by PCR with primers P1 and P2.Determination of spag4 cDNA ends by RACE RT-PCR was carried out using male pupal total RNA isolated as recommended in the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX), and then used in 5′ RLM-RACE and 3′ RACE. The 5′ end of the gene was amplified using the RNA adapter-specific forward outer and inner primers, and the gene-specific reverse primer P3. To amplify the 3′ end of the gene, anchored oligo-(dT) adapter primers from the FirstChoice kit were used in RT. In the PCR, the gene-specific forward primer P4 and the 3′ adapter-specific outer primer were used. 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and their sequences verified. A complete spag4 cDNA with 5′ and 3′ UTRs was generated by PCR using a mixture of partially overlapping RACE products as template and the 5′ and 3′ adapter-specific primers. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy, sequenced and catalogued as EF537040 at .Construction of spag4 genomic transgenes The transgene pC4-spag4 was generated by ligating the spag4 coding region as a 4.9 kb PstI fragment from BACR02J20 into the PstI site of pCaSpEr-4 (pC4) (Thummel and Pirrotta, 1992). The GFP-tagged version, pC4-spag4:gfp, was generated by ligating the GFP ORF from pUAST-gfp (Kracklauer et al., 2007) immediately downstream of the spag4 coding region in pC4-spag4. For this purpose, an AscI site was introduced immediately upstream of the spag4 stop codon using the QuikChange II PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primer pair P13-P14. The GFP ORF with AscI sites on both ends (generated by PCR using primers P11-P12 on the pUAST-gfp template) was then cloned into this AscI site. To generate pC4-spag4:6xmyc, a 6xmyc ORF was amplified from the pUAST-6xmyc vector (Kracklauer et al., 2007) using the PCR primers P15 and P16, and the ORF was then cloned into the AscI site as for pC4-spag4:GFP. To generate pC4-spag4SUNstop, a stop codon was introduced into the 4.9 kb PstI fragment using the mutagenic primers P21-P22, and the resulting mutated fragment was cloned into the PstI site of pC4 as described above.Generation of spag4 knockout The targeting construct (pW35-spag4HRKO) was generated as follows. DNA sequences of ~3 kb (upstream) and ~5 kb (downstream) flanking the spag4 coding region were amplified by PCR using hot-start Herculase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), primer sets P5-P6 and P7-P8, and BAC02J20 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) as template. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy and their sequences verified. The upstream 3 kb fragment was excised from pGEM-T-Easy with NotI and cloned into that site of pW35 (Gong and Golic, 2003). The downstream 5 kb fragment was excised from pGEM-T-Easy with BamHI and AvrII, then cloned into those sites in pW35 downstream of the w+ marker gene, resulting in pW35-spag4HRKO. After generation of transgenic lines, a cross of 500 y w, pW35 spag4HRKO/FM7c, gfp virgin females with 500 (y) w;; [hs-FLP],[hs-I-SceI]/TM3, Sb males was set up with subsequent embryo manipulation and heat shocks, as described previously (Kracklauer et al., 2007). ~400 crosses of 3-4 w+-mosaic (y) w, pW35-spag4HRKO/+;; [hs-FLP],[hs-I-SceI]/+ F1 virgin females and 3-4 w; hs-FLP males were performed. F2 progeny were screened for a single male from each cross with solid w+ eyes, indicative of targeted insertion events. Insertions were mapped for 100 independent F2 candidate knockout males using standard methods; for 87 candidates, the insertion mapped to chromosome 2 as expected. For ~50 such stocks, spag4 targeting was assessed by Southern blotting (Kracklauer et al., 2007). Ultimately, five independent spag4 knockout alleles – 1, 6, 11, 12 and 15 – were isolated. Allele 6 was used for most studies.Quantitative fertility assays Twenty individual spag4 homozygous or spag4/Df(2L)Prl males were each crossed to two w1118 virgins. As a control, 20 crosses using w1118 males homozygous for a wild-type (Oregon-R) copy of chromosome 2 (w1118;ORC2iso) were set up. For the fertility rescue assays, 20 individual spag4 homozygous males bearing a single copy of the transgene pC4-spag4, pC4-spag4:gfp, pC4-spag4:6xmyc or pC4-spag4-SUNstop were used. To assay female fertility, 20 virgin spag4 homozygous or spag4/Df(2L)Prl females were assayed individually with two w1118 males. Similar crosses with w1118; ORC2iso virgin females were set up in parallel as wild-type controls. After 1 week, average combined numbers of larvae and pupae per vial were determined.TEM Testes were fixed on ice for 2 hours in PBS with 2% glutaraldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA], rinsed, then post-fixed at room temperature for 2 hours in 2% OsO4 (EMS) and 0.8% K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1× symcollidine buffer (McDonald, 1984; Jinguji and Ishikawa, 1990). Tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in resin using standard procedures. 50-60 nm sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM208 electron microscope.Immunocytology Testes were fixed and stained essentially as described (Lin et al., 1996; Zhong and Belote, 2007; Texada et al., 2008), and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 50% glycerol. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-MYC, 1:2000; rabbit anti-MYC, 1:200; rabbit anti-CM1, 1:100 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rabbit anti-Vasa, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-γ-tubulin, 1:500 (Sigma) and chicken anti-Yuri, 1:400 (Texada et al., 2008). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-chicken, all at 1:500 (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain F-actin and TOPRO-3 to stain DNA, were mixed into secondary antibody solutions at 15 μl phalloidin/ml and 1 μl/ml TOPRO-3. DAPI for DNA staining was added to mounting solution at 1 μl/ml. Testes were imaged with Leica AOBS SP2 and Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscopes and a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using Metamorph deconvolution software. Adobe Photoshop was used to process all images.In situ hybridization (ISH) ISH was carried out essentially as described (White-Cooper et al., 1998), using an 820 bp PCR product from the spag4 ORF to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche).Supplementary Material [Supplementary Material] supp_123_16_2763__index.html (6.6KB, html) Acknowledgments We are grateful to C.

    "title": "Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901686/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Human space exploration, with its promise of unprecedented discoveries, excites the imagination. However, turning the exploration of space into a practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration, a better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required. Among the many aspects of biology affected by spaceflight, we have focused on the immune response. Immune dysfunction is a major health-related problem on earth and a major obstacle to long-term space missions [1]. As early as the Apollo and Skylab missions, immune dysfunction was recognized in astronauts, and later studies documented specific host cellular and humoral immune alterations induced by spaceflight [1]. Increased microbial growth and virulence in space have also been documented [2]. Spaceflight is associated with many stresses, with altered gravitational force (g) representing the most studied factor. Microgravity (µg) is constant in space, and hypergravity (hyper g) is experienced during launch and landing. Immune dysfunction in both µg and hyper g is well documented, but determination of the underlying cellular mechanisms and thus routes to appropriate countermeasures, remains unresolved [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Without normal immune function, many threats to long-term survival in space exist: fatal infections, failed immunosurveillance of cancer cells, aberrant inflammatory responses and reactivation of latent viruses are all potential hazards. In our work, we have brought advances in understanding the host defense of Drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight. Drosophila is a well-established model for human innate immune function, sharing elements in cellular and humoral immunity, clotting and wound healing, and signaling pathways [7]. Drosophila responds to microbial infection with 1) a systemic response, characterized by fat body production of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), 2) tissue specific responses, such as production of AMPs in the gut and trachea, 3) phagocytosis by hemocytes, and 4) clotting and wound healing [7], [8], [9], [10]. Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in Drosophila [7], [11], [12]. The Toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and Gram-positive (Lys-type peptidoglycan (PGN)) infections, and the Imd pathway responds to Gram-negative (DAP-type PGN) infections [7]. Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) have been identified in mammals and are the direct mediators of responses to activators such as bacterial lipopolysacccharide and viral DNA [13]. Imd shares homology with the death domain of the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor pathway [7]. Downstream, through the conserved NF-kB/Rel protein transcription factors relish (Imd signaling cascade), and DIF and dorsal (Toll signaling cascade), the AMPs and ∼400 other genes are involved in response to infection [7], [14], [15]. Recognition of the complexity of the Toll and Imd pathways continues to grow, for example with identification of new regulators, interactions with the nervous system, and modification with aging [16], [17], [18], [19]. In contrast to mammals, in Drosophila only the original Toll was associated with infection response, through indirect sensing mediated by binding to Spätzle (Spz). More recently however, other Toll family members have been identified as mediating infection. Toll-8 regulates infection response in the airway epithelium [20], and Toll-7 is involved in viral recognition and response [21]. The mechanisms of interactions within and between the Toll and Imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood, and unraveling the interrelationships will require many approaches. Here, we present genetic and transcriptional profiling experiments to address the response to infection in conditions related to space travel: Does hypergravity affect the response to fungal infection? Does development during spaceflight alter the response to bacterial and fungal infections?",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Drosophila Stocks All experiments used only males. Oregon-R wild-type flies were used. Others are: imd1 (Flybase FB, FBal0045906), yuri c263 and UAS-yuri (FBgn0045842 and [23]), Thor2 and Thor1rev1 (FBgn0261560 and [65], [66]), spz4 (FBal0016062) and imdEY08573 (FBal0159146) [44]. The stock for the space and Earth flies, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, expressed GFP in the blood cells [44]. The space containers are presented in Marcu et al. [64]. Microorganisms and Infections Bacterial infections with E. coli ATCC 25922 were as previously described [65], [67]. A single spore isolate of Beauveria bassiana (strain GHA) was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Conidia and hyphae were harvested by passing culture through a sterile ASTM No. 100 sieve. Spores were also flown on the space shuttle and we are happy to provide information upon request. Natural infection by B. bassiana used a dosage of 9.5×106 spores/fly, with procedures and survival assays as previously described [67]. Ten replicates of 20 flies each for all strains were used in all 3 experiments for the CARU hypergravity tests. The centrifuge was stopped once per day to conduct survival counts. Control survival assays after bacterial and fungal infections on wild-type, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, imd1, imdEY08573 and spz4 [67] were conducted at Kennedy Space Center to establish that space and Earth fly infections were proceeding in accordance with our standardized conditions. Energy Content Flies were homogenized in a solution containing 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.6. Homogenates were heated for 5 min at 75°C to inactivate lipases. Triacylglyceride levels were measured using a commercial serum triglyceride kit (Sigma; St. Louis, Missouri USA; No. TR0100-1KT), and protein content was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method [68]. Carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose) were digested with amyloglucosidase and quantified with a blood glucose kit (Pointe Scientific; Canton, Michigan, USA; No. G7521). 4–14 flies were assayed for each treatment group, and all assays were performed in triplicate. Gene Expression Analysis Total RNA was extracted from flies utilizing the Qiagen RNeasy© RNA isolation kit. mRNA amplification, labeling, hybridization to Drosophila Genome 2.0 GeneChips© (Affymetrix), staining and scanning were performed as previously described [69] utilizing protocols in the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Technical Manual. RMA-based, (Partek Genomics Suite©, v.6.6) algorithms were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG). Three replicate samples were included in each control and experimental group. A minimum fold-difference of +/−1.5 (p-value ≤0.05) was used as the cut off criteria for generating DEG lists. DEG lists were hierarchically clustered and sub-clusters were subjected to pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA©) and DAVID (http://apps1.niaid.nih.gov/david) web-interfaced software. GEO accession number is GSE53196. qPCR analysis was carried out on cDNA made using the Bio-Rad iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (No. 170–8891) and utilized the Bio-Rad SsoAdvanced™ SYBR® Green Supermix (No. 172–5260). Reaction mixtures were prepared as specified in the product protocol and used QuantiTect Primer Assays from Qiagen: Metchnikowin (No. QT01109619), Drosomycin (No. QT00957432), and RPL32 (rp49) (No. QT00985677). Samples were run in triplicate on the Bio-Rad qPCR CFX thermal cycler.",
    "results": "Results and Discussion Hypergravity Increases Survival after Infection with Pathogenic Fungus The first goal was to test our hypothesis that the immune response of Drosophila would be affected by changes in gravity at the organismal level. The simplest immune function assay is post-infection survival, and a straightforward route for altering gravity is to achieve hyper g through use of centrifuges similar to the human centrifuges used for training pilots. We infected with B. bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus that enters through the cuticle and is well studied with respect to survival kinetics and Toll pathway activation [7]. Infected and control flies were then exposed to hypergravity on a centrifuge maintained at the Chronic Acceleration Research Unit (CARU), UC Davis. The survival of wild type and immune response mutants (except Toll pathway mutants which do not survive infection long enough for prolonged hyper g experiments) was assessed. Strikingly, all strains showed increased post-infection survival at hyper g (Figure 1A bottom panel, 1B wild type, imd and Thor strains). Given that µg is associated with impaired immune function, one interpretation of this result is that hyper g exerts the opposite effect and boosts the host response. Opposite effects of opposing gravity vectors are not uncommon, for example for platelet functions [22]. However, microorganisms can become more virulent at µg [2], and an alternative explanation is that at hyper g the fungus itself is less virulent. Figure 1. Effects of hyper g on post-infection survival and energy stores. Open in a new tab A. Survival after infection with B. bassiana is increased by exposure to hyper g (4 g) in wild type (wt) and the rescued yuri strain, yuri c263; UAS-yuri (UAS), but not in the gravitaxis mutant yuri, yuri c263 (yuri). +infected, −uninfected. Error bars = SEM for 3 experiments. B. Additional strains tested also survive infection longer at hyper g: imd, using imd1, and for Thor, which encodes the Drosophila translational regulator 4E-BP, using Thor2, the null allele, and its control, the revertant strain Thor1rev1. P values for log rank. C. Post-infection energy stores of trigycerides, protein and carbohydrates are not significantly different at hyper g. Error bars = SEM for 3 experiments.In an attempt to distinguish between host and fungal responses, we tested a gravitaxis mutation of the gene yuri gagarin (yuri) [23]. yuri encodes 3 isoforms of a coiled-coil protein that is ubiquitously expressed, and two mutations have separate tissue specific functions related to mechanotransduction [24], [25], [26]. The yuric263 allele, caused by a GAL4 enhancer trap insertion, has defective gravity responses. A UAS-yuri construct, driven by the c263 transposon, rescues this phenotype through expression limited to mechanosensory neurons [23], indicating defective gravity sensing in the yuric263 mutant. We hypothesized that if host response to hyper g were primary, then aberrant gravity sensing in yuric263 might modify the hyper g post-infection response, but if the fungal response were primary, then post-infection survival of yuric263would be comparable to that of wild type and the immune function mutants (Figure 1AB). On testing, yuric263 failed to show this increased post-infection survival, whereas the yuri rescue strain had the typical increased survival response (Figure 1AB). Thus, these data demonstrate a significant host component to the hyper g effect. How might hyper g increase post-infection survival? The yuri finding could indicate a neural route linking mechanical load sensation to immune response. Mechanical load also affects cell biological processes [27], and one possibility is that endocytosis, which is essential for Toll signaling [28], is enhanced at hyper g. Interestingly, Yuri protein appears to have membrane-associated functions [26]. The immune response is energetically expensive, and flies with greater energetic reserves may have greater post-infection survival. However, survival did not correlate with stores of triglycerides, carbohydrates or protein (Figure 1C). The Fungus, Immunity, Tumorigenesis (FIT) Microgravity Experiment These results showing that the immune response of Drosophila responds to g force formed the basis for the space shuttle experiment Fungus, Immunity and Tumorigenesis (FIT). FIT is the first flight experiment to investigate µg effects on Drosophila immunity. The FIT experiment was flown on the shuttle Discovery (STS-121), and involved an experimental design adjusted for shuttle conditions. Ideally the design would have paralleled the hyper g work, with infection of Drosophila genotypes proceeding in space. But due to flight constraints, space infections were not possible and only a single genotype could be flown. However, the flight duration (12 days) allowed production and return to Earth of a small population of flies that had undergone their entire development in space (space flies). Upon return this population was divided into three groups and used for transcription profiling without infection and after infection with B. bassiana or E. coli. The fungal spores and E. coli used were grown on Earth. Earth-reared flies, grown at Kennedy Space Center, were used as controls (Earth flies). Recordings relayed from the shuttle ensured similar growth conditions for the space and Earth flies other than the change in g force. The experiments thus encompass humoral immunity in response to Toll and Imd mediated fungal and bacterial infections through transcriptional profiling after development in space. The uninfected space flies showed an altered transcriptional profile, and those changes will be presented last, in the context of the immune response data. The Toll Pathway is Dysfunctional in Adults Raised in Space Transcriptional profiling of space and Earth flies infected with B. bassiana revealed that the space flies have a dramatically different response (Figure 2). For Earth flies, the upregulated genes revealed the expected [7], [14], [15] response categories: transcripts for genes associated with innate immune response, serine peptidase activity, response to fungus and Toll signaling pathway activation were all statistically over-represented (Figure 2). In stark contrast, none of these gene categories was upregulated in space flies (Figure 2). Figure 2. Microarray-based analysis of response to B. bassiana. Open in a new tab The total number of genes upregulated or downregulated in Earth flies only (Earth) or space flies only (Space) or in both (overlap) are indicated by Venn diagrams. Pathway analysis of each of these groups is shown on the right side of the figure. The number of genes in each functional category is depicted in bar graphs (primary y-axis), and the P values corresponding to statistical over-representation of each category are presented as a line graph (secondary y-axis). Note that certain genes annotated into more than one of these categories.The AMPs Metchnikowin and Drosomycin are key indices of the Toll signaling response [7]. Figures 3 and 4A present transcriptional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray-based analysis establishing the failed induction of these two genes in space flies. Results of microarray-based analysis for additional genes are also presented in Figure 4A. Note that necrotic (nec) is upregulated in the Earth flies, which is an indicator of a strong anti-fungal response since Nec downregulates the immune reaction via negative regulation of Persephone (Psh) [29]. A complete listing of the fold changes and associated p values for all the transcriptionally modulated genes of the categories shown in Figure 2 is presented in Table S1. Figure 3. Antifungal AMPs. Open in a new tab A. Metchnikowin and B. Drosomycin transcript levels were assessed by qPCR in space and Earth flies infected with fungus (F) or bacteria (B), or uninfected (U), and standardized by comparison to the level of ribosomal protein gene rp49.

Open in a new tab A.Relative expression levels of selected Toll associated genes as detected by microarray are shown in uninfected (U, circles) Earth (blue) and space (tan) flies, and following fungal (F, triangles) or bacterial (B, squares) infection of space and Earth flies. Transcriptional regulation A. not shared or B. shared by space and earth flies infected with fungus.Collectively, these data indicate that Toll mediated responses to B. bassiana are impaired in space flies, and in particular the failure of Drosomycin and Metchnikowin activation indicates that the space flies are severely immunocompromised. The data do not, however, reflect a complete failure of the space flies to react to the infection. Some defense response category genes were activated in space flies as well as Earth flies (Figure 2 and Table S1), and these indicate that signaling pathways other than Toll are functional in space flies. Some of these genes are Turandot (Tot) family members, a set of genes induced under a variety of stresses such as septic infection, paraquat feeding, UV exposure and heat shock, and with complex regulation involving the Jak-Stat, Imd and Mekk1 pathways [30], [31], [32]. Also induced in both space and Earth flies are the fungal infection response genes Thioester containing protein IV (Tep IV), which has an alpha-macroglobulin complement component, and Transferrin 1 (Tsf1), which is predicted to be involved in iron homeostasis. Both of these genes are also induced in response to DNA damage in the larval epidermis, as is Tot C [33], [34]. The only AMP gene induced in space flies by the fungal infection is Drosomycin-like 5 (Drsl5) (Figure 4B). Drsl5 induction in response to B. bassiana is regulated by both the Toll and Imd pathways [7]. Thus induction of Drsl5 in the space flies is not necessarily evidence for a functional Toll response and may represent activation by the Imd pathway (see below) or another route. Both space and Earth flies upregulated genes associated with response to toxins, including cytochrome P450s (Cyp4ac1, Cyp4ac2, Cyp4aa1, Cyp304a1), which are associated with detoxification of xenobiotics and hormone metabolism [35], [36] (Table S1). Genes induced uniquely in the space flies by fungal infection could indicate an altered infection response. However, only one category of genes emerged from microarray analysis as specifically induced by infection in space flies: oxidation/reduction (Figure 2 and Table S1). Six of the eight genes in this category are Pyrroline 5-carboyxlate reductase (P5cr), probable cytochrome P450s (Cyp6t1, Cyp6t1 and Cyp6a13), CG6012 and CG10131. The remaining two genes, phenoloxidase subunit A3 (PO45) and prophenol oxidase A1 (proPO-A1), have roles in melanization, which is also used as a defense against pathogens and in wound response [37]. However, other genes in the melanization cascade were upregulated in Earth flies but unchanged in the space flies, e.g. MP1, Spn27A and Hayan [38], [39]. In contrast, Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3) is upregulated in space flies, and GNBP3 assembles defense complexes, including phenol oxidases, in a Toll independent manner [40]. Initial detection of B. bassiana infection occurs through dual signaling arms upstream of Spz, the only known ligand for Toll [16], [41]. In one arm, Psh, moderated by suppression from Nec, senses fungal virulence factors and other danger signals, leading to activation of the Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE), cleavage of the Spz prodomain, and binding of processed Spz to the Toll transmembrane receptor [29]. In the other signaling arm, GNBP3 binds fungal cell wall components and initiates a cascade via ModSP and Grass that also leads to SPE activation and Spätzle binding to Toll [16], [42]. Thus, if space flies are defective in initial sensing of the infection, a minimum of two defects are needed to block both arms of the upstream signaling cascade. If the space flies are not defective in sensing, a single non-functional step at the level of SPE or further downstream in the Toll pathway could prevent the activation of target genes. The Imd Pathway is Activated Normally in Adults Raised in Space In complete contrast to fungal infection, space flies infected with E. coli show strong gene expression responses similar in character to those of Earth flies (Figure 5). For both Earth and space flies, expected categories of upregulated genes [7], [14], [15] were statistically over-represented: innate immunity, response to bacterium and humoral immune response (Figure 5). Accordingly, the Imd pathway appears to have been activated normally in the space flies. Table 1 presents a subset of these genes categorized into AMPs, Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), Turandot, Immune induced molecules, Thioester-containing proteins, and Miscellaneous. Table S2 details all of the transcriptionally upregulated and downregulated genes in the categories presented in Figure 5. Drosomycin and Metchnikowin are included among the standard AMP genes activated by E. coli infection (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4). Despite its activation by a Gram-negative organism, Drosomycin is mainly considered a readout for Toll signaling through cross recognition extracellularly or cross talk intracellularly with Imd or another pathway [16]. As discussed below, our hypotheses on the effects of µg on Toll function would suggest the cross-reaction is downstream of Toll receptor activation. Metchnikowin has both antibacterial and antifungal activity, and can be activated transcriptionally through Imd or Toll, depending on the type of infection [43]. Thus the normal induction of Metchnikowin in the bacteria infected space flies, but lack of induction in the fungus infected space flies, characterizes the normal Imd signaling versus the abnormal Toll signaling of the space flies.

Adults Raised during Spaceflight have an Altered Transcriptional Profile Comparing the transcription profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies provides valuable insights into the biological processes affected by the µg environment and thus generates clues as to the origin of the differing effects on Imd and Toll mediated responses. These comparisons may also provide evidence relevant to the enhanced post-infection survival at hyper g. The transcriptional profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies were compared by first hierarchically clustering genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups (Figure 6). Pathway analysis indicated the transcripts expressed at higher levels in space flies included a statistical over-representation of genes linked to stress response, inosine monophosphate (IMP) metabolism, response to hypoxia, wing disc morphogenesis, and apoptosis. A much smaller list of transcripts was expressed at lower levels in space flies than Earth flies, and appeared to be enriched in genes associated with symporter activity, oxidation/reduction, and structural molecule activity (Figure 6). Several immune response genes were also differentially expressed, but were not statistically over-represented as a functional category: relish (2.4 fold), spätzle (1.7 fold), dorsal (1.6 fold), virus-induced RNA 1(2.1 fold), Serpin 28Db (1.6 fold), serine peptidase CG18563 (2.0 fold), pirk (1.6 fold), and PGRP-LF (1.6 fold). In total, less than only 280 genes showed a significant difference in expression between space and Earth flies (Table 2, Table S3). Interestingly, 127 of these genes are uncharacterized and only identified as CG numbers [44], and may also be of interest in the spaceflight and immune context as more information is acquired.

The heat shock response is evolutionarily conserved and perhaps the most well studied stress response [45]. Heat shock proteins also function under normal conditions, and in general act as molecular chaperones assisting in forming, or regaining, the normal folding of polypeptides, translocating proteins, and regulating protein degradation [45], [46]. The heat shock response occurs in reaction to many types of stress and is usually initiated by unfolded/misfolded proteins. In correcting this cytotoxic state heat shock proteins also inhibit apoptosis [45], [47]. Given their functions, it is not surprising that heat shock gene expression changes have been associated with altered gravity and spaceflight in a variety of organisms; however, results are variable and a clear picture of heat shock protein involvement in these situations has not emerged [48], [49], [50], [51]. Two further categories of altered gene expression are noteworthy with respect to the heat shock result seen for the space flies: apoptosis and response to hypoxia (Table 2). Six genes associated with apoptosis are upregulated: starvin, which is a cochaperone associated with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) [52]; the caspase Damm, which can trigger apoptosis when overexpressed [53]; Pdk1, a serine/threonine kinase that is a negative regulator of apoptosis [54]; Drep-3, one of four Drosophila DNA fragmentation factor-related proteins [55]; dream, a serine threonine rich caspase [56]; and Rab3-GEF, a Ras superfamily member predicted to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis [57]. The response to hypoxia category includes a subset of the heat shock protein genes and hairy, a master regulator for adjustment to hypoxia [58]. Together these transcriptional alterations indicate severe stress associated with protein unfolding during development of the flies in µg. Do these changes in the space flies provide insight into the failed immune response to fungal infection versus the robust immune response to bacterial infection? Although differences in the physiologies of the two infections, i.e. acute infection by the non-pathogenic E.coli and chronic infection by the pathogenic B. bassiana, may play some role here, the strong heat shock response produced by the space environment offers two testable molecular hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 The extracellular space is more susceptible to protein unfolding in stress conditions than the intracellular environment. Thus in the µg conditions experienced by the space flies, the more complex extracellular induction events associated with Toll activation (recognition, activation of SPE, cleavage of Spz and binding to Toll) are more susceptible to disruption than those associated with activation of the Imd pathway. For the Imd pathway, the extracellular event is direct binding of bacterial components, PGN, to cell surface receptors, PGRPs [19]. A corollary of this hypothesis is that, in time, the heat shock proteins may mediate recovery of Toll signaling.Hypothesis 2 Heat shock protein(s) interferes directly with the binding of (processed) Spz to Toll. In mammals, extracellular heat shock proteins bind directly to Tlr receptors and are important in moderating the immune response, including in the clinical setting [59], [60], [61]. In contrast in Drosophila, Spz is the only known ligand for Toll [16], [42]. Heat shock proteins do not, however, need to be Toll ligands in order to interfere with Spätzle binding, or to inhibit activity of essential upstream components such as SPE, Psh and Grass. A corollary is that heat shock proteins may be both positive and negative regulators of the Toll signaling pathway, inhibiting or enhancing according to the conditions. This corollary is analogous to the positive and negative regulation of Tlrs effected by extracellular heat shock proteins in mammals [62]. These hypotheses on heat shock protein mediation of the effects of g force on immune responses have broad implications, providing insights into established findings, suggestions for further experimentation and predictions for other stressful conditions. One clear, testable, inference is that the compromised human immunity seen at altered g results from protein unfolding and heat shock protein engagement. Our hypotheses also suggest an underlying mechanism for our hyper g findings. Thus hyper g may stabilize proteins against unfolding or affect heat shock protein interaction with Toll receptors. Effects on the stability, folded status or function of endocytotic components may be particularly important both at hyper g and µg since endocytosis is essential for Toll, but not Imd, signaling [28]. A further possibility is that most common stresses such as sleep deprivation, physical activity, and ageing, affect immune responses via these proposed routes. Other studies have noted the opposing effects of increased and reduced g force on expression of individual Drosophila genes in uninfected flies [50], [63]. In addition, in one µg experiment, phagocytosis in adult Drosophila females, but not larvae, raised in space was reported to be normal, and expression of a few antimicrobial genes was altered in these adults by infection with an E. coli strain that does not grow in Drosophila [64]. In the future, experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS), where multi-generational studies with multiple strains of flies and pathogens are possible, would provide an optimal route for testing the hypotheses suggested here. Other factors that might affect microgravity immune responses - such as the route for pathogen delivery, developmental events, microbiome, and signaling pathway modulation by epigenetics or non-coding RNA activity - could also be addressed. The key to applying the full capacity of Drosophila aboard the ISS for an understanding of gravitational effects on innate immunity will be the use of a wide range of pathogens, genotypes, and approaches by many different investigators. The juxtaposition of our µg and hyper g findings highlights the importance of gravity in normal immune function and begins to elaborate the key cellular and molecular components of the immune system that respond to changes in gravity. Our findings also suggest that exposure to gravity may mitigate the deleterious physiological, including immune, consequences of spaceflight and provide a rationale for including human centrifuges on facilities for long-term transport and housing of humans in space.",

The simplest immune function assay is post-infection survival, and a straightforward route for altering gravity is to achieve hyper g through use of centrifuges similar to the human centrifuges used for training pilots.

A UAS-yuri construct, driven by the c263 transposon, rescues this phenotype through expression limited to mechanosensory neurons [23], indicating defective gravity sensing in the yuric263 mutant. We hypothesized that if host response to hyper g were primary, then aberrant gravity sensing in yuric263 might modify the hyper g post-infection response, but if the fungal response were primary, then post-infection survival of yuric263would be comparable to that of wild type and the immune function mutants (Figure 1AB). On testing, yuric263 failed to show this increased post-infection survival, whereas the yuri rescue strain had the typical increased survival response (Figure 1AB). Thus, these data demonstrate a significant host component to the hyper g effect. How might hyper g increase post-infection survival? The yuri finding could indicate a neural route linking mechanical load sensation to immune response. Mechanical load also affects cell biological processes [27], and one possibility is that endocytosis, which is essential for Toll signaling [28], is enhanced at hyper g. Interestingly, Yuri protein appears to have membrane-associated functions [26]. The immune response is energetically expensive, and flies with greater energetic reserves may have greater post-infection survival. However, survival did not correlate with stores of triglycerides, carbohydrates or protein (Figure 1C). The Fungus, Immunity, Tumorigenesis (FIT) Microgravity Experiment These results showing that the immune response of Drosophila responds to g force formed the basis for the space shuttle experiment Fungus, Immunity and Tumorigenesis (FIT). FIT is the first flight experiment to investigate µg effects on Drosophila immunity. The FIT experiment was flown on the shuttle Discovery (STS-121), and involved an experimental design adjusted for shuttle conditions. Ideally the design would have paralleled the hyper g work, with infection of Drosophila genotypes proceeding in space. But due to flight constraints, space infections were not possible and only a single genotype could be flown. However, the flight duration (12 days) allowed production and return to Earth of a small population of flies that had undergone their entire development in space (space flies). Upon return this population was divided into three groups and used for transcription profiling without infection and after infection with B. bassiana or E. coli. The fungal spores and E. coli used were grown on Earth. Earth-reared flies, grown at Kennedy Space Center, were used as controls (Earth flies). Recordings relayed from the shuttle ensured similar growth conditions for the space and Earth flies other than the change in g force. The experiments thus encompass humoral immunity in response to Toll and Imd mediated fungal and bacterial infections through transcriptional profiling after development in space. The uninfected space flies showed an altered transcriptional profile, and those changes will be presented last, in the context of the immune response data. The Toll Pathway is Dysfunctional in Adults Raised in Space Transcriptional profiling of space and Earth flies infected with B. bassiana revealed that the space flies have a dramatically different response (Figure 2). For Earth flies, the upregulated genes revealed the expected [7], [14], [15] response categories: transcripts for genes associated with innate immune response, serine peptidase activity, response to fungus and Toll signaling pathway activation were all statistically over-represented (Figure 2). In stark contrast, none of these gene categories was upregulated in space flies (Figure 2). Figure 2. Microarray-based analysis of response to B. bassiana. Open in a new tab The total number of genes upregulated or downregulated in Earth flies only (Earth) or space flies only (Space) or in both (overlap) are indicated by Venn diagrams. Pathway analysis of each of these groups is shown on the right side of the figure. The number of genes in each functional category is depicted in bar graphs (primary y-axis), and the P values corresponding to statistical over-representation of each category are presented as a line graph (secondary y-axis). Note that certain genes annotated into more than one of these categories.The AMPs Metchnikowin and Drosomycin are key indices of the Toll signaling response [7]. Figures 3 and 4A present transcriptional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray-based analysis establishing the failed induction of these two genes in space flies. Results of microarray-based analysis for additional genes are also presented in Figure 4A. Note that necrotic (nec) is upregulated in the Earth flies, which is an indicator of a strong anti-fungal response since Nec downregulates the immune reaction via negative regulation of Persephone (Psh) [29]. A complete listing of the fold changes and associated p values for all the transcriptionally modulated genes of the categories shown in Figure 2 is presented in Table S1. Figure 3. Antifungal AMPs.

Transcriptional regulation A. not shared or B. shared by space and earth flies infected with fungus.Collectively, these data indicate that Toll mediated responses to B. bassiana are impaired in space flies, and in particular the failure of Drosomycin and Metchnikowin activation indicates that the space flies are severely immunocompromised. The data do not, however, reflect a complete failure of the space flies to react to the infection. Some defense response category genes were activated in space flies as well as Earth flies (Figure 2 and Table S1), and these indicate that signaling pathways other than Toll are functional in space flies. Some of these genes are Turandot (Tot) family members, a set of genes induced under a variety of stresses such as septic infection, paraquat feeding, UV exposure and heat shock, and with complex regulation involving the Jak-Stat, Imd and Mekk1 pathways [30], [31], [32]. Also induced in both space and Earth flies are the fungal infection response genes Thioester containing protein IV (Tep IV), which has an alpha-macroglobulin complement component, and Transferrin 1 (Tsf1), which is predicted to be involved in iron homeostasis. Both of these genes are also induced in response to DNA damage in the larval epidermis, as is Tot C [33], [34]. The only AMP gene induced in space flies by the fungal infection is Drosomycin-like 5 (Drsl5) (Figure 4B). Drsl5 induction in response to B. bassiana is regulated by both the Toll and Imd pathways [7]. Thus induction of Drsl5 in the space flies is not necessarily evidence for a functional Toll response and may represent activation by the Imd pathway (see below) or another route. Both space and Earth flies upregulated genes associated with response to toxins, including cytochrome P450s (Cyp4ac1, Cyp4ac2, Cyp4aa1, Cyp304a1), which are associated with detoxification of xenobiotics and hormone metabolism [35], [36] (Table S1). Genes induced uniquely in the space flies by fungal infection could indicate an altered infection response. However, only one category of genes emerged from microarray analysis as specifically induced by infection in space flies: oxidation/reduction (Figure 2 and Table S1). Six of the eight genes in this category are Pyrroline 5-carboyxlate reductase (P5cr), probable cytochrome P450s (Cyp6t1, Cyp6t1 and Cyp6a13), CG6012 and CG10131. The remaining two genes, phenoloxidase subunit A3 (PO45) and prophenol oxidase A1 (proPO-A1), have roles in melanization, which is also used as a defense against pathogens and in wound response [37]. However, other genes in the melanization cascade were upregulated in Earth flies but unchanged in the space flies, e.g. MP1, Spn27A and Hayan [38], [39]. In contrast, Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3) is upregulated in space flies, and GNBP3 assembles defense complexes, including phenol oxidases, in a Toll independent manner [40]. Initial detection of B. bassiana infection occurs through dual signaling arms upstream of Spz, the only known ligand for Toll [16], [41]. In one arm, Psh, moderated by suppression from Nec, senses fungal virulence factors and other danger signals, leading to activation of the Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE), cleavage of the Spz prodomain, and binding of processed Spz to the Toll transmembrane receptor [29]. In the other signaling arm, GNBP3 binds fungal cell wall components and initiates a cascade via ModSP and Grass that also leads to SPE activation and Spätzle binding to Toll [16], [42]. Thus, if space flies are defective in initial sensing of the infection, a minimum of two defects are needed to block both arms of the upstream signaling cascade. If the space flies are not defective in sensing, a single non-functional step at the level of SPE or further downstream in the Toll pathway could prevent the activation of target genes. The Imd Pathway is Activated Normally in Adults Raised in Space In complete contrast to fungal infection, space flies infected with E. coli show strong gene expression responses similar in character to those of Earth flies (Figure 5). For both Earth and space flies, expected categories of upregulated genes [7], [14], [15] were statistically over-represented: innate immunity, response to bacterium and humoral immune response (Figure 5). Accordingly, the Imd pathway appears to have been activated normally in the space flies. Table 1 presents a subset of these genes categorized into AMPs, Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), Turandot, Immune induced molecules, Thioester-containing proteins, and Miscellaneous. Table S2 details all of the transcriptionally upregulated and downregulated genes in the categories presented in Figure 5. Drosomycin and Metchnikowin are included among the standard AMP genes activated by E. coli infection (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4). Despite its activation by a Gram-negative organism, Drosomycin is mainly considered a readout for Toll signaling through cross recognition extracellularly or cross talk intracellularly with Imd or another pathway [16]. As discussed below, our hypotheses on the effects of µg on Toll function would suggest the cross-reaction is downstream of Toll receptor activation. Metchnikowin has both antibacterial and antifungal activity, and can be activated transcriptionally through Imd or Toll, depending on the type of infection [43]. Thus the normal induction of Metchnikowin in the bacteria infected space flies, but lack of induction in the fungus infected space flies, characterizes the normal Imd signaling versus the abnormal Toll signaling of the space flies.

Adults Raised during Spaceflight have an Altered Transcriptional Profile Comparing the transcription profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies provides valuable insights into the biological processes affected by the µg environment and thus generates clues as to the origin of the differing effects on Imd and Toll mediated responses. These comparisons may also provide evidence relevant to the enhanced post-infection survival at hyper g. The transcriptional profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies were compared by first hierarchically clustering genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups (Figure 6). Pathway analysis indicated the transcripts expressed at higher levels in space flies included a statistical over-representation of genes linked to stress response, inosine monophosphate (IMP) metabolism, response to hypoxia, wing disc morphogenesis, and apoptosis. A much smaller list of transcripts was expressed at lower levels in space flies than Earth flies, and appeared to be enriched in genes associated with symporter activity, oxidation/reduction, and structural molecule activity (Figure 6). Several immune response genes were also differentially expressed, but were not statistically over-represented as a functional category: relish (2.4 fold), spätzle (1.7 fold), dorsal (1.6 fold), virus-induced RNA 1(2.1 fold), Serpin 28Db (1.6 fold), serine peptidase CG18563 (2.0 fold), pirk (1.6 fold), and PGRP-LF (1.6 fold). In total, less than only 280 genes showed a significant difference in expression between space and Earth flies (Table 2, Table S3). Interestingly, 127 of these genes are uncharacterized and only identified as CG numbers [44], and may also be of interest in the spaceflight and immune context as more information is acquired.

The heat shock response is evolutionarily conserved and perhaps the most well studied stress response [45]. Heat shock proteins also function under normal conditions, and in general act as molecular chaperones assisting in forming, or regaining, the normal folding of polypeptides, translocating proteins, and regulating protein degradation [45], [46]. The heat shock response occurs in reaction to many types of stress and is usually initiated by unfolded/misfolded proteins. In correcting this cytotoxic state heat shock proteins also inhibit apoptosis [45], [47]. Given their functions, it is not surprising that heat shock gene expression changes have been associated with altered gravity and spaceflight in a variety of organisms; however, results are variable and a clear picture of heat shock protein involvement in these situations has not emerged [48], [49], [50], [51]. Two further categories of altered gene expression are noteworthy with respect to the heat shock result seen for the space flies: apoptosis and response to hypoxia (Table 2). Six genes associated with apoptosis are upregulated: starvin, which is a cochaperone associated with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) [52]; the caspase Damm, which can trigger apoptosis when overexpressed [53]; Pdk1, a serine/threonine kinase that is a negative regulator of apoptosis [54]; Drep-3, one of four Drosophila DNA fragmentation factor-related proteins [55]; dream, a serine threonine rich caspase [56]; and Rab3-GEF, a Ras superfamily member predicted to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis [57]. The response to hypoxia category includes a subset of the heat shock protein genes and hairy, a master regulator for adjustment to hypoxia [58]. Together these transcriptional alterations indicate severe stress associated with protein unfolding during development of the flies in µg. Do these changes in the space flies provide insight into the failed immune response to fungal infection versus the robust immune response to bacterial infection? Although differences in the physiologies of the two infections, i.e. acute infection by the non-pathogenic E.coli and chronic infection by the pathogenic B. bassiana, may play some role here, the strong heat shock response produced by the space environment offers two testable molecular hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 The extracellular space is more susceptible to protein unfolding in stress conditions than the intracellular environment. Thus in the µg conditions experienced by the space flies, the more complex extracellular induction events associated with Toll activation (recognition, activation of SPE, cleavage of Spz and binding to Toll) are more susceptible to disruption than those associated with activation of the Imd pathway. For the Imd pathway, the extracellular event is direct binding of bacterial components, PGN, to cell surface receptors, PGRPs [19]. A corollary of this hypothesis is that, in time, the heat shock proteins may mediate recovery of Toll signaling.Hypothesis 2 Heat shock protein(s) interferes directly with the binding of (processed) Spz to Toll. In mammals, extracellular heat shock proteins bind directly to Tlr receptors and are important in moderating the immune response, including in the clinical setting [59], [60], [61]. In contrast in Drosophila, Spz is the only known ligand for Toll [16], [42]. Heat shock proteins do not, however, need to be Toll ligands in order to interfere with Spätzle binding, or to inhibit activity of essential upstream components such as SPE, Psh and Grass. A corollary is that heat shock proteins may be both positive and negative regulators of the Toll signaling pathway, inhibiting or enhancing according to the conditions. This corollary is analogous to the positive and negative regulation of Tlrs effected by extracellular heat shock proteins in mammals [62]. These hypotheses on heat shock protein mediation of the effects of g force on immune responses have broad implications, providing insights into established findings, suggestions for further experimentation and predictions for other stressful conditions. One clear, testable, inference is that the compromised human immunity seen at altered g results from protein unfolding and heat shock protein engagement. Our hypotheses also suggest an underlying mechanism for our hyper g findings. Thus hyper g may stabilize proteins against unfolding or affect heat shock protein interaction with Toll receptors. Effects on the stability, folded status or function of endocytotic components may be particularly important both at hyper g and µg since endocytosis is essential for Toll, but not Imd, signaling [28]. A further possibility is that most common stresses such as sleep deprivation, physical activity, and ageing, affect immune responses via these proposed routes. Other studies have noted the opposing effects of increased and reduced g force on expression of individual Drosophila genes in uninfected flies [50], [63]. In addition, in one µg experiment, phagocytosis in adult Drosophila females, but not larvae, raised in space was reported to be normal, and expression of a few antimicrobial genes was altered in these adults by infection with an E. coli strain that does not grow in Drosophila [64]. In the future, experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS), where multi-generational studies with multiple strains of flies and pathogens are possible, would provide an optimal route for testing the hypotheses suggested here. Other factors that might affect microgravity immune responses - such as the route for pathogen delivery, developmental events, microbiome, and signaling pathway modulation by epigenetics or non-coding RNA activity - could also be addressed. The key to applying the full capacity of Drosophila aboard the ISS for an understanding of gravitational effects on innate immunity will be the use of a wide range of pathogens, genotypes, and approaches by many different investigators. The juxtaposition of our µg and hyper g findings highlights the importance of gravity in normal immune function and begins to elaborate the key cellular and molecular components of the immune system that respond to changes in gravity. Our findings also suggest that exposure to gravity may mitigate the deleterious physiological, including immune, consequences of spaceflight and provide a rationale for including human centrifuges on facilities for long-term transport and housing of humans in space.",

Copyright notice ID: 3901686 PMID: 24475130 Abstract Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.Introduction Human space exploration, with its promise of unprecedented discoveries, excites the imagination. However, turning the exploration of space into a practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration, a better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required. Among the many aspects of biology affected by spaceflight, we have focused on the immune response. Immune dysfunction is a major health-related problem on earth and a major obstacle to long-term space missions [1]. As early as the Apollo and Skylab missions, immune dysfunction was recognized in astronauts, and later studies documented specific host cellular and humoral immune alterations induced by spaceflight [1]. Increased microbial growth and virulence in space have also been documented [2]. Spaceflight is associated with many stresses, with altered gravitational force (g) representing the most studied factor. Microgravity (µg) is constant in space, and hypergravity (hyper g) is experienced during launch and landing. Immune dysfunction in both µg and hyper g is well documented, but determination of the underlying cellular mechanisms and thus routes to appropriate countermeasures, remains unresolved [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Without normal immune function, many threats to long-term survival in space exist: fatal infections, failed immunosurveillance of cancer cells, aberrant inflammatory responses and reactivation of latent viruses are all potential hazards. In our work, we have brought advances in understanding the host defense of Drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight. Drosophila is a well-established model for human innate immune function, sharing elements in cellular and humoral immunity, clotting and wound healing, and signaling pathways [7]. Drosophila responds to microbial infection with 1) a systemic response, characterized by fat body production of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), 2) tissue specific responses, such as production of AMPs in the gut and trachea, 3) phagocytosis by hemocytes, and 4) clotting and wound healing [7], [8], [9], [10]. Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in Drosophila [7], [11], [12]. The Toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and Gram-positive (Lys-type peptidoglycan (PGN)) infections, and the Imd pathway responds to Gram-negative (DAP-type PGN) infections [7]. Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) have been identified in mammals and are the direct mediators of responses to activators such as bacterial lipopolysacccharide and viral DNA [13]. Imd shares homology with the death domain of the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor pathway [7]. Downstream, through the conserved NF-kB/Rel protein transcription factors relish (Imd signaling cascade), and DIF and dorsal (Toll signaling cascade), the AMPs and ∼400 other genes are involved in response to infection [7], [14], [15]. Recognition of the complexity of the Toll and Imd pathways continues to grow, for example with identification of new regulators, interactions with the nervous system, and modification with aging [16], [17], [18], [19]. In contrast to mammals, in Drosophila only the original Toll was associated with infection response, through indirect sensing mediated by binding to Spätzle (Spz). More recently however, other Toll family members have been identified as mediating infection. Toll-8 regulates infection response in the airway epithelium [20], and Toll-7 is involved in viral recognition and response [21]. The mechanisms of interactions within and between the Toll and Imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood, and unraveling the interrelationships will require many approaches. Here, we present genetic and transcriptional profiling experiments to address the response to infection in conditions related to space travel: Does hypergravity affect the response to fungal infection? Does development during spaceflight alter the response to bacterial and fungal infections?Results and Discussion Hypergravity Increases Survival after Infection with Pathogenic Fungus The first goal was to test our hypothesis that the immune response of Drosophila would be affected by changes in gravity at the organismal level. The simplest immune function assay is post-infection survival, and a straightforward route for altering gravity is to achieve hyper g through use of centrifuges similar to the human centrifuges used for training pilots. We infected with B. bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus that enters through the cuticle and is well studied with respect to survival kinetics and Toll pathway activation [7]. Infected and control flies were then exposed to hypergravity on a centrifuge maintained at the Chronic Acceleration Research Unit (CARU), UC Davis. The survival of wild type and immune response mutants (except Toll pathway mutants which do not survive infection long enough for prolonged hyper g experiments) was assessed. Strikingly, all strains showed increased post-infection survival at hyper g (Figure 1A bottom panel, 1B wild type, imd and Thor strains). Given that µg is associated with impaired immune function, one interpretation of this result is that hyper g exerts the opposite effect and boosts the host response. Opposite effects of opposing gravity vectors are not uncommon, for example for platelet functions [22]. However, microorganisms can become more virulent at µg [2], and an alternative explanation is that at hyper g the fungus itself is less virulent. Figure 1. Effects of hyper g on post-infection survival and energy stores. Open in a new tab A. Survival after infection with B. bassiana is increased by exposure to hyper g (4 g) in wild type (wt) and the rescued yuri strain, yuri c263; UAS-yuri (UAS), but not in the gravitaxis mutant yuri, yuri c263 (yuri). +infected, −uninfected. Error bars = SEM for 3 experiments. B. Additional strains tested also survive infection longer at hyper g: imd, using imd1, and for Thor, which encodes the Drosophila translational regulator 4E-BP, using Thor2, the null allele, and its control, the revertant strain Thor1rev1. P values for log rank. C. Post-infection energy stores of trigycerides, protein and carbohydrates are not significantly different at hyper g. Error bars = SEM for 3 experiments.In an attempt to distinguish between host and fungal responses, we tested a gravitaxis mutation of the gene yuri gagarin (yuri) [23]. yuri encodes 3 isoforms of a coiled-coil protein that is ubiquitously expressed, and two mutations have separate tissue specific functions related to mechanotransduction [24], [25], [26]. The yuric263 allele, caused by a GAL4 enhancer trap insertion, has defective gravity responses. A UAS-yuri construct, driven by the c263 transposon, rescues this phenotype through expression limited to mechanosensory neurons [23], indicating defective gravity sensing in the yuric263 mutant. We hypothesized that if host response to hyper g were primary, then aberrant gravity sensing in yuric263 might modify the hyper g post-infection response, but if the fungal response were primary, then post-infection survival of yuric263would be comparable to that of wild type and the immune function mutants (Figure 1AB). On testing, yuric263 failed to show this increased post-infection survival, whereas the yuri rescue strain had the typical increased survival response (Figure 1AB). Thus, these data demonstrate a significant host component to the hyper g effect. How might hyper g increase post-infection survival? The yuri finding could indicate a neural route linking mechanical load sensation to immune response. Mechanical load also affects cell biological processes [27], and one possibility is that endocytosis, which is essential for Toll signaling [28], is enhanced at hyper g. Interestingly, Yuri protein appears to have membrane-associated functions [26]. The immune response is energetically expensive, and flies with greater energetic reserves may have greater post-infection survival. However, survival did not correlate with stores of triglycerides, carbohydrates or protein (Figure 1C).The Fungus, Immunity, Tumorigenesis (FIT) Microgravity Experiment These results showing that the immune response of Drosophila responds to g force formed the basis for the space shuttle experiment Fungus, Immunity and Tumorigenesis (FIT). FIT is the first flight experiment to investigate µg effects on Drosophila immunity. The FIT experiment was flown on the shuttle Discovery (STS-121), and involved an experimental design adjusted for shuttle conditions. Ideally the design would have paralleled the hyper g work, with infection of Drosophila genotypes proceeding in space. But due to flight constraints, space infections were not possible and only a single genotype could be flown. However, the flight duration (12 days) allowed production and return to Earth of a small population of flies that had undergone their entire development in space (space flies). Upon return this population was divided into three groups and used for transcription profiling without infection and after infection with B. bassiana or E. coli. The fungal spores and E. coli used were grown on Earth. Earth-reared flies, grown at Kennedy Space Center, were used as controls (Earth flies). Recordings relayed from the shuttle ensured similar growth conditions for the space and Earth flies other than the change in g force. The experiments thus encompass humoral immunity in response to Toll and Imd mediated fungal and bacterial infections through transcriptional profiling after development in space. The uninfected space flies showed an altered transcriptional profile, and those changes will be presented last, in the context of the immune response data.The Toll Pathway is Dysfunctional in Adults Raised in Space Transcriptional profiling of space and Earth flies infected with B. bassiana revealed that the space flies have a dramatically different response (Figure 2). For Earth flies, the upregulated genes revealed the expected [7], [14], [15] response categories: transcripts for genes associated with innate immune response, serine peptidase activity, response to fungus and Toll signaling pathway activation were all statistically over-represented (Figure 2). In stark contrast, none of these gene categories was upregulated in space flies (Figure 2). Figure 2. Microarray-based analysis of response to B. bassiana. Open in a new tab The total number of genes upregulated or downregulated in Earth flies only (Earth) or space flies only (Space) or in both (overlap) are indicated by Venn diagrams. Pathway analysis of each of these groups is shown on the right side of the figure. The number of genes in each functional category is depicted in bar graphs (primary y-axis), and the P values corresponding to statistical over-representation of each category are presented as a line graph (secondary y-axis). Note that certain genes annotated into more than one of these categories.The AMPs Metchnikowin and Drosomycin are key indices of the Toll signaling response [7]. Figures 3 and 4A present transcriptional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray-based analysis establishing the failed induction of these two genes in space flies. Results of microarray-based analysis for additional genes are also presented in Figure 4A. Note that necrotic (nec) is upregulated in the Earth flies, which is an indicator of a strong anti-fungal response since Nec downregulates the immune reaction via negative regulation of Persephone (Psh) [29]. A complete listing of the fold changes and associated p values for all the transcriptionally modulated genes of the categories shown in Figure 2 is presented in Table S1. Figure 3. Antifungal AMPs. Open in a new tab A. Metchnikowin and B. Drosomycin transcript levels were assessed by qPCR in space and Earth flies infected with fungus (F) or bacteria (B), or uninfected (U), and standardized by comparison to the level of ribosomal protein gene rp49.

Open in a new tab A.Relative expression levels of selected Toll associated genes as detected by microarray are shown in uninfected (U, circles) Earth (blue) and space (tan) flies, and following fungal (F, triangles) or bacterial (B, squares) infection of space and Earth flies. Transcriptional regulation A. not shared or B. shared by space and earth flies infected with fungus.Collectively, these data indicate that Toll mediated responses to B. bassiana are impaired in space flies, and in particular the failure of Drosomycin and Metchnikowin activation indicates that the space flies are severely immunocompromised. The data do not, however, reflect a complete failure of the space flies to react to the infection. Some defense response category genes were activated in space flies as well as Earth flies (Figure 2 and Table S1), and these indicate that signaling pathways other than Toll are functional in space flies. Some of these genes are Turandot (Tot) family members, a set of genes induced under a variety of stresses such as septic infection, paraquat feeding, UV exposure and heat shock, and with complex regulation involving the Jak-Stat, Imd and Mekk1 pathways [30], [31], [32]. Also induced in both space and Earth flies are the fungal infection response genes Thioester containing protein IV (Tep IV), which has an alpha-macroglobulin complement component, and Transferrin 1 (Tsf1), which is predicted to be involved in iron homeostasis. Both of these genes are also induced in response to DNA damage in the larval epidermis, as is Tot C [33], [34]. The only AMP gene induced in space flies by the fungal infection is Drosomycin-like 5 (Drsl5) (Figure 4B). Drsl5 induction in response to B. bassiana is regulated by both the Toll and Imd pathways [7]. Thus induction of Drsl5 in the space flies is not necessarily evidence for a functional Toll response and may represent activation by the Imd pathway (see below) or another route. Both space and Earth flies upregulated genes associated with response to toxins, including cytochrome P450s (Cyp4ac1, Cyp4ac2, Cyp4aa1, Cyp304a1), which are associated with detoxification of xenobiotics and hormone metabolism [35], [36] (Table S1). Genes induced uniquely in the space flies by fungal infection could indicate an altered infection response. However, only one category of genes emerged from microarray analysis as specifically induced by infection in space flies: oxidation/reduction (Figure 2 and Table S1). Six of the eight genes in this category are Pyrroline 5-carboyxlate reductase (P5cr), probable cytochrome P450s (Cyp6t1, Cyp6t1 and Cyp6a13), CG6012 and CG10131. The remaining two genes, phenoloxidase subunit A3 (PO45) and prophenol oxidase A1 (proPO-A1), have roles in melanization, which is also used as a defense against pathogens and in wound response [37]. However, other genes in the melanization cascade were upregulated in Earth flies but unchanged in the space flies, e.g. MP1, Spn27A and Hayan [38], [39]. In contrast, Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3) is upregulated in space flies, and GNBP3 assembles defense complexes, including phenol oxidases, in a Toll independent manner [40]. Initial detection of B. bassiana infection occurs through dual signaling arms upstream of Spz, the only known ligand for Toll [16], [41]. In one arm, Psh, moderated by suppression from Nec, senses fungal virulence factors and other danger signals, leading to activation of the Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE), cleavage of the Spz prodomain, and binding of processed Spz to the Toll transmembrane receptor [29]. In the other signaling arm, GNBP3 binds fungal cell wall components and initiates a cascade via ModSP and Grass that also leads to SPE activation and Spätzle binding to Toll [16], [42]. Thus, if space flies are defective in initial sensing of the infection, a minimum of two defects are needed to block both arms of the upstream signaling cascade. If the space flies are not defective in sensing, a single non-functional step at the level of SPE or further downstream in the Toll pathway could prevent the activation of target genes.The Imd Pathway is Activated Normally in Adults Raised in Space In complete contrast to fungal infection, space flies infected with E. coli show strong gene expression responses similar in character to those of Earth flies (Figure 5). For both Earth and space flies, expected categories of upregulated genes [7], [14], [15] were statistically over-represented: innate immunity, response to bacterium and humoral immune response (Figure 5). Accordingly, the Imd pathway appears to have been activated normally in the space flies. Table 1 presents a subset of these genes categorized into AMPs, Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), Turandot, Immune induced molecules, Thioester-containing proteins, and Miscellaneous. Table S2 details all of the transcriptionally upregulated and downregulated genes in the categories presented in Figure 5. Drosomycin and Metchnikowin are included among the standard AMP genes activated by E. coli infection (Table 1, Figures 3 and 4). Despite its activation by a Gram-negative organism, Drosomycin is mainly considered a readout for Toll signaling through cross recognition extracellularly or cross talk intracellularly with Imd or another pathway [16]. As discussed below, our hypotheses on the effects of µg on Toll function would suggest the cross-reaction is downstream of Toll receptor activation. Metchnikowin has both antibacterial and antifungal activity, and can be activated transcriptionally through Imd or Toll, depending on the type of infection [43]. Thus the normal induction of Metchnikowin in the bacteria infected space flies, but lack of induction in the fungus infected space flies, characterizes the normal Imd signaling versus the abnormal Toll signaling of the space flies.

Adults Raised during Spaceflight have an Altered Transcriptional Profile Comparing the transcription profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies provides valuable insights into the biological processes affected by the µg environment and thus generates clues as to the origin of the differing effects on Imd and Toll mediated responses. These comparisons may also provide evidence relevant to the enhanced post-infection survival at hyper g. The transcriptional profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies were compared by first hierarchically clustering genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups (Figure 6). Pathway analysis indicated the transcripts expressed at higher levels in space flies included a statistical over-representation of genes linked to stress response, inosine monophosphate (IMP) metabolism, response to hypoxia, wing disc morphogenesis, and apoptosis. A much smaller list of transcripts was expressed at lower levels in space flies than Earth flies, and appeared to be enriched in genes associated with symporter activity, oxidation/reduction, and structural molecule activity (Figure 6). Several immune response genes were also differentially expressed, but were not statistically over-represented as a functional category: relish (2.4 fold), spätzle (1.7 fold), dorsal (1.6 fold), virus-induced RNA 1(2.1 fold), Serpin 28Db (1.6 fold), serine peptidase CG18563 (2.0 fold), pirk (1.6 fold), and PGRP-LF (1.6 fold). In total, less than only 280 genes showed a significant difference in expression between space and Earth flies (Table 2, Table S3). Interestingly, 127 of these genes are uncharacterized and only identified as CG numbers [44], and may also be of interest in the spaceflight and immune context as more information is acquired. Figure 6. Analysis of transcriptional modulations produced by spaceflight.

The heat shock response is evolutionarily conserved and perhaps the most well studied stress response [45]. Heat shock proteins also function under normal conditions, and in general act as molecular chaperones assisting in forming, or regaining, the normal folding of polypeptides, translocating proteins, and regulating protein degradation [45], [46]. The heat shock response occurs in reaction to many types of stress and is usually initiated by unfolded/misfolded proteins. In correcting this cytotoxic state heat shock proteins also inhibit apoptosis [45], [47]. Given their functions, it is not surprising that heat shock gene expression changes have been associated with altered gravity and spaceflight in a variety of organisms; however, results are variable and a clear picture of heat shock protein involvement in these situations has not emerged [48], [49], [50], [51]. Two further categories of altered gene expression are noteworthy with respect to the heat shock result seen for the space flies: apoptosis and response to hypoxia (Table 2). Six genes associated with apoptosis are upregulated: starvin, which is a cochaperone associated with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) [52]; the caspase Damm, which can trigger apoptosis when overexpressed [53]; Pdk1, a serine/threonine kinase that is a negative regulator of apoptosis [54]; Drep-3, one of four Drosophila DNA fragmentation factor-related proteins [55]; dream, a serine threonine rich caspase [56]; and Rab3-GEF, a Ras superfamily member predicted to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis [57]. The response to hypoxia category includes a subset of the heat shock protein genes and hairy, a master regulator for adjustment to hypoxia [58]. Together these transcriptional alterations indicate severe stress associated with protein unfolding during development of the flies in µg. Do these changes in the space flies provide insight into the failed immune response to fungal infection versus the robust immune response to bacterial infection? Although differences in the physiologies of the two infections, i.e. acute infection by the non-pathogenic E.coli and chronic infection by the pathogenic B. bassiana, may play some role here, the strong heat shock response produced by the space environment offers two testable molecular hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 The extracellular space is more susceptible to protein unfolding in stress conditions than the intracellular environment. Thus in the µg conditions experienced by the space flies, the more complex extracellular induction events associated with Toll activation (recognition, activation of SPE, cleavage of Spz and binding to Toll) are more susceptible to disruption than those associated with activation of the Imd pathway. For the Imd pathway, the extracellular event is direct binding of bacterial components, PGN, to cell surface receptors, PGRPs [19]. A corollary of this hypothesis is that, in time, the heat shock proteins may mediate recovery of Toll signaling.Hypothesis 2 Heat shock protein(s) interferes directly with the binding of (processed) Spz to Toll. In mammals, extracellular heat shock proteins bind directly to Tlr receptors and are important in moderating the immune response, including in the clinical setting [59], [60], [61]. In contrast in Drosophila, Spz is the only known ligand for Toll [16], [42]. Heat shock proteins do not, however, need to be Toll ligands in order to interfere with Spätzle binding, or to inhibit activity of essential upstream components such as SPE, Psh and Grass. A corollary is that heat shock proteins may be both positive and negative regulators of the Toll signaling pathway, inhibiting or enhancing according to the conditions. This corollary is analogous to the positive and negative regulation of Tlrs effected by extracellular heat shock proteins in mammals [62]. These hypotheses on heat shock protein mediation of the effects of g force on immune responses have broad implications, providing insights into established findings, suggestions for further experimentation and predictions for other stressful conditions. One clear, testable, inference is that the compromised human immunity seen at altered g results from protein unfolding and heat shock protein engagement. Our hypotheses also suggest an underlying mechanism for our hyper g findings. Thus hyper g may stabilize proteins against unfolding or affect heat shock protein interaction with Toll receptors. Effects on the stability, folded status or function of endocytotic components may be particularly important both at hyper g and µg since endocytosis is essential for Toll, but not Imd, signaling [28]. A further possibility is that most common stresses such as sleep deprivation, physical activity, and ageing, affect immune responses via these proposed routes. Other studies have noted the opposing effects of increased and reduced g force on expression of individual Drosophila genes in uninfected flies [50], [63]. In addition, in one µg experiment, phagocytosis in adult Drosophila females, but not larvae, raised in space was reported to be normal, and expression of a few antimicrobial genes was altered in these adults by infection with an E. coli strain that does not grow in Drosophila [64]. In the future, experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS), where multi-generational studies with multiple strains of flies and pathogens are possible, would provide an optimal route for testing the hypotheses suggested here. Other factors that might affect microgravity immune responses - such as the route for pathogen delivery, developmental events, microbiome, and signaling pathway modulation by epigenetics or non-coding RNA activity - could also be addressed. The key to applying the full capacity of Drosophila aboard the ISS for an understanding of gravitational effects on innate immunity will be the use of a wide range of pathogens, genotypes, and approaches by many different investigators. The juxtaposition of our µg and hyper g findings highlights the importance of gravity in normal immune function and begins to elaborate the key cellular and molecular components of the immune system that respond to changes in gravity. Our findings also suggest that exposure to gravity may mitigate the deleterious physiological, including immune, consequences of spaceflight and provide a rationale for including human centrifuges on facilities for long-term transport and housing of humans in space.Materials and Methods Drosophila Stocks All experiments used only males. Oregon-R wild-type flies were used. Others are: imd1 (Flybase FB, FBal0045906), yuri c263 and UAS-yuri (FBgn0045842 and [23]), Thor2 and Thor1rev1 (FBgn0261560 and [65], [66]), spz4 (FBal0016062) and imdEY08573 (FBal0159146) [44]. The stock for the space and Earth flies, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, expressed GFP in the blood cells [44]. The space containers are presented in Marcu et al. [64].Microorganisms and Infections Bacterial infections with E. coli ATCC 25922 were as previously described [65], [67]. A single spore isolate of Beauveria bassiana (strain GHA) was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Conidia and hyphae were harvested by passing culture through a sterile ASTM No. 100 sieve. Spores were also flown on the space shuttle and we are happy to provide information upon request. Natural infection by B. bassiana used a dosage of 9.5×106 spores/fly, with procedures and survival assays as previously described [67]. Ten replicates of 20 flies each for all strains were used in all 3 experiments for the CARU hypergravity tests. The centrifuge was stopped once per day to conduct survival counts. Control survival assays after bacterial and fungal infections on wild-type, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, imd1, imdEY08573 and spz4 [67] were conducted at Kennedy Space Center to establish that space and Earth fly infections were proceeding in accordance with our standardized conditions.Energy Content Flies were homogenized in a solution containing 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.6. Homogenates were heated for 5 min at 75°C to inactivate lipases. Triacylglyceride levels were measured using a commercial serum triglyceride kit (Sigma; St. Louis, Missouri USA; No. TR0100-1KT), and protein content was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method [68]. Carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose) were digested with amyloglucosidase and quantified with a blood glucose kit (Pointe Scientific; Canton, Michigan, USA; No. G7521). 4–14 flies were assayed for each treatment group, and all assays were performed in triplicate.Gene Expression Analysis Total RNA was extracted from flies utilizing the Qiagen RNeasy© RNA isolation kit. mRNA amplification, labeling, hybridization to Drosophila Genome 2.0 GeneChips© (Affymetrix), staining and scanning were performed as previously described [69] utilizing protocols in the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Technical Manual. RMA-based, (Partek Genomics Suite©, v.6.6) algorithms were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG). Three replicate samples were included in each control and experimental group. A minimum fold-difference of +/−1.5 (p-value ≤0.05) was used as the cut off criteria for generating DEG lists. DEG lists were hierarchically clustered and sub-clusters were subjected to pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA©) and DAVID (http://apps1.niaid.nih.gov/david) web-interfaced software. GEO accession number is GSE53196. qPCR analysis was carried out on cDNA made using the Bio-Rad iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (No. 170–8891) and utilized the Bio-Rad SsoAdvanced™ SYBR® Green Supermix (No. 172–5260). Reaction mixtures were prepared as specified in the product protocol and used QuantiTect Primer Assays from Qiagen: Metchnikowin (No. QT01109619), Drosomycin (No. QT00957432), and RPL32 (rp49) (No. QT00985677). Samples were run in triplicate on the Bio-Rad qPCR CFX thermal cycler.Supporting Information Table S1Individual genes for all categories of the response to B. bassiana in Figure 2.
