    "abstract": "Abstract As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction In host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [1,2]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [3]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [4,5,6,7]. The Leptopilina/Drosophila system is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [8]. To suppress host immunity, Leptopilina females introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [4,9,10]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms in Drosophila [11,12,13] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialist L. boulardi activates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as drosomycin is activated after L. boulardi infection [14]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [15,16], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [17,18]. In contrast, infection by the generalist L. heterotoma suppresses both immune pathways [9,14], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [19,20]. In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of an L. heterotoma peptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in the L. heterotoma venom but not in L. boulardi venom [21]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [21,22,23]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [24]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [25,26] to snails [27]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [28] and cone snail venom [27], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [26], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [25,26,29] and invertebrates [30]. The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence [30]. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design [30], potentially even for cancer treatments [31]. Various lines of experimental evidence demonstrate or suggest antimicrobial capabilities for different knottins [25,26,29,30,32,33] or gated ion channel interactions [28,34], although the molecular mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known if these antimicrobial functions share a common mechanism of action. Given its discovery from immune-suppressive particles from fly parasites, our goals were to (a) identify LhKNOT-related sequences from diverse organisms, including L. heterotoma, L. boulardi, and Ganaspis parasitoids, that attack Drosophila and (b) identify any novel structural motif(s) present in the known or new LhKNOT homologs with the hope that the prediction of such a conserved motif might suggest possible functions for LhKNOT and guide future experimental research. We show that a theoretical model of LhKNOT possesses the hallmarks of the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta sheets, constrained by disulfide bridges. The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation) [35]. Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs from L. heterotoma, L. boulardi, and Ganaspis spp. wasps successfully on D. melanogaster. These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from three Drosophila parasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions.",
    "methods": "4. Methods 4.1. Sequence Analysis Initial scans of the  non-redundant protein sequence (nr) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein; accessed on 4 April 2018), the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa; accessed on 16 April 2018) [66], and the Protein Data Bank (PDB; https://www.rcsb.org; accessed on 5 July 2018) [67] with the full-length amino acid sequence of the L. heterotoma knottin peptide (GAJC01011813.1) using  BLAST (BLASTp; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 16 April 2018) [68] were used to retrieve related protein sequences in other organisms. Remote homologs were searched using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 4 April 2022) [69], and Hidden Markov Models (HMMER; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer; accessed on 6 April 2022) [70,71]. BLAST searches were adjusted to word size 2, and scoring matrix BLOSUM45, while default parameters were used for HMMER. To identify knottin homologs in select Leptopilina and Ganaspis spp. not accessible in the protein databases, targeted searches using translated BLASTs against genomic and transcriptomic datasets were employed. To identify additional L. heterotoma knottins, the L. heterotoma female abdominal transcriptome GAJC [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GHUQ (GenBank Accession: GHUP00000000;TSA: Leptopilina heterotoma strain Lh14, transcriptome shotgun) and Space GHUP (GenBank Accession: GHUQ00000000;TSA: Leptopilina heterotoma strain Lh14, transcriptome shotgun) were searched using tblastn (e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM62, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. The following transcriptomes were similarly searched to identify L. boulardi knottins: L. boulardi female abdominal transcriptome GAJA [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GITC (GenBank Accession: GITC00000000; TSA: Leptopilina boulardi strain Lb17, transcriptome shotgun), Space GISX (GenBank Accession: GISX00000000; TSA: Leptopilina boulardi strain Lb17, transcriptome shotgun), and GGGI00000000 (female abdomen/head) [73]. In addition, targeted searches for Ganaspis spp. homologs were carried out. For G. hookeri, the GAIW00000000 TSA: Ganaspis spp. G1 dataset [74] was searched (tblastn, e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM45, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) using the LhKNOT query. The Expasy tool (web.expasy.org/translate/; accessed on 9 December 2022) was used to translate these TSA sequences [75]. The resulting predicted peptide sequences were manually curated based on the presence of the cysteine motif. For G. brasiliensis, AUGUSTUS-based (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus; accessed on 9 April 2020) [76] gene predictions from the partially assembled genomic sequence (Gen-Bank:GCA_009823575.1) were made using the Nasonia vitripenis genome training module. The resulting predicted proteins were searched using blastp (e-value threshold set to 1, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. Alignments and visualization were performed using EBI’s Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo; accessed on 9 December 2022) [77] to confirm the presence of the knottin motif and for further curation of the sequences. The set of identified sequences were aligned to LhKNOT to create a multiple sequence alignment using T-COFFEE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/tcoffee; accessed on 9 December 2022) [78] and visualized using ESPript3 (https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php; accessed on 9 December 2022) [79] to identify any conserved residues and/or motif(s) in the aligned sequences. 4.2. LhKNOT Primary Structure Analysis The LhKNOT sequence was also analyzed by the domain/motif detection database Conserved Domain Database (CDD; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml; accessed on 6 April 2018) and Pfam (pfam.xfam.org; accessed on 6 April 2018) to identify any domains or sequence signatures [80,81]. The sequence was further analyzed using the signal sequence prediction software SignalP-5.0 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-5.0; accessed on 6 April 2018) [82] and Phobius (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/phobius; accessed on 6 April 2018) [83] to identify the location of the signal sequence and allow for a more accurate characterization of the peptide. The mature peptide of 36 amino acids (with the predicted signal sequence, residues 1–24, removed) was used for further analysis. The secondary structure of the peptide was predicted using the meta-server Sympred (https://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/sympredwww; accessed on 6 April 2018) [84] and analyzed to confirm its correspondence to the expected secondary structure for a knottin fold: an initial alpha-helical segment (predicted signal sequence) followed by three anti-parallel beta strands. 4.3. Tertiary Structure Prediction and Evaluation of LhKNOT and Its Homologs The programs I-Tasser (https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER; accessed on 16 April 2018) [85], Modeller (https://salilab.org/modeller; accessed on 16 April 2018) [86], and HHPred (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred; accessed on 6 April 2018) [37] were used to model the tertiary structure of LhKNOT. Three structural homologs with the knottin-like fold Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [30], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [28], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [25] were identified as top candidates and used as templates in model building programs. The predicted model for LhKNOT was evaluated by Verify3D (https://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/verify3d; accessed on 18 April 2018) [39], VoroMQA (https://bioinformatics.lt/wtsam/voromqa; accessed on 18 April 2018) [40], and Prosa-web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php; accessed on 18 April 2018) [38]. Evaluating small peptides with standard evaluation tools can have limitations. Thus, scores from solved tertiary structures of NMR and crystallography-derived peptides of similar size and shape (PDB: 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) were used to interpret the evaluation scores of our LhKNOT models. The top-ranked model was created using HHPred [37], a modeling program that uses the underlying model-building program, Modeller [86] using a restraint-based comparative modeling approach. In addition, the KNOTTIN database’s KNOTER3D tool (https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/KNOTTIN/knoter3d.php; accessed on 15 May 2020) [36] was used to evaluate the model’s tertiary structure, confirming LhKNOT’s adoption of the Knottin fold. All the identified homologs with no known structures were modeled using the top template identified in HHPred [37]. 4.4. CPC Clip Motif Identification Superposition of LhKNOT’s structural model with the known structures of a CPC clip containing knottin peptide from the cactus Pereskia bleo (PDB: 5XBD) [26] using the programs Superpose (http://superpose.wishartlab.com; accessed on 12 September 2018) [87] and MultiProt (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt; accessed on 12 September 2018) [88] suggested the presence of a heparin-binding CPC clip motif. To confirm the presence of the CPC clip in LhKNOT, docking analysis using the program, ClusPro 2.0 (which offers parameters specific to heparin as ligand; https://cluspro.org; accessed on 2 March 2019) [89], and subsequent analysis of predicted docking scenarios in the visualization program, PyMOL (https://pymol.org; accessed on 10 March 2019) [90] was performed. All potential docking scenarios were analyzed for identifying residues forming the putative CPC clip motif using the following steps. All polar interactions between LhKNOT and heparin were visualized in PyMOL and lists of participating residues were compiled. Predictions that contained the necessary Cation–Polar–Cation interactions were then further scrutinized for adherence to the CPC clip motif parameter by measuring distances between alpha carbons of participating residues as well as distances between center of mass of participating residues. PyMOL’s “Measurements” Wizard tool was used to measure distances between α-carbons of the participating residues. To evaluate the distances between centers of mass, a user-generated script available in the pymolwiki website (Henschel, https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Center_of_mass; accessed on 15 March 2019) was used to generate pseudo-atoms at the calculated sidechain center of mass. PyMOL’s APBS Electrostatics Plugin [91] was used to render the surface electrostatics for the modeled LhKNOT. Similar steps were carried out to identify the CPC clip motif in each of the remaining knottin proteins in Supplementary Table S5. 4.5. Association of LhKNOT with Other GAGs To assess whether the CPC clip would facilitate binding with additional GAGs, further docking was performed with hyaluronic acid (PDB: 1HYA) and keratan sulfate (PDB: 1KES). In the case of hyaluronic acid, extraneous atoms (O, Na) were removed from the space surrounding the molecule. Keratan sulfate’s model was used as is. Docking was performed using AutoDock (https://autodock.scripps.edu; accessed on 7 April 2020) [92], and results were visualized in PyMOL. Results were then input into PDBSum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html; accessed on 10 April 2020) [93] to generate Ligplots to confirm GAG-CPC clip binding. 4.6. Protein-Heparin Docking Analysis for Mutated CPC Clip in LhKNOT To investigate the importance of the CPC clip in heparin binding, mutated models of LhKNOT were generated using PyMOL’s mutagenesis tool, substituting the CPC clip residues with alanine. Models were created piecewise, first substituting just R14, then R1 and R14, and finally R14, R1, and S3. Heparin docking of all models was performed using ClusPro, and analysis was performed as described previously. 4.7. Protein-Heparin Docking Analysis in Structural Homologs and Drosomycin To further evaluate the presence of the CPC clip motif in the knottin peptide family, the previous methods were further expanded to (a) structural homologs of LhKNOT (PDB: 5XBD, 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) [25,26,28,30]; (b) Drosophila Drosomycin (PDB: 1MYN) [43], a peptide with known antifungal activity; (c) modeled homologous knottin proteins, and (d) representative knottins from different categories in the KNOTTIN database. Results were considered to adhere to the motif if measurements fell within 3Å of the CPC clip parameters, to allow for some flexibility of protein loop conformations.",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. The LhKNOT Sequence Shows Similarity to Insect and Plant Antimicrobial Peptides A BLASTp search of the nr and TSA databases using the full-length LhKNOT sequence (60 amino acids) showed a limited number of significant hits, primarily annotated as “antimicrobial peptides”, from plants and insects. A few fungal sequences were also identified. All results displayed less than 60% amino acid identity to LhKNOT. The top match for LhKNOT in the nr database was an antimicrobial peptide from the common beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, while the top hit in the TSA database was an antimicrobial peptide from the wheat curl mite Aceria tosichella. The conservation was most prominent in the region of the only sequence motif associated with LhKNOT, the cysteine knotted ‘antifungal peptide’ signature (pfam11410 domain, E = 2.8 × 10−3). After running PSI-BLAST for detection of remote homologs, additional sequences were revealed. PSI-BLAST showed similar results with common ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; red mites, Dinothrombium tinctorium; parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma pretiosum; click beetle, Ignelater luminosus; parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma brassicae; common pollen beetle, Brassicogethes aeneus; ash borer, Agrilus planipennis; and sawfly, Neodiprion lecontei. Using the Hidden Markov Models-driven HMMER webserver as an alternative method of detecting remote homologs, we identified five fungal hits from Akanthomyces lecanii, Cordyceps javanica, Cordyceps confragosa, Rosellinia necatrix, and Beauveria bassiana. A search of the PDB for similar sequences retrieved only two significant results, one for a knottin-type antifungal peptide Alo-3 from the insect Acrocinus longimanus and the second from the disulfide-constrained wound healing peptide pB1 from Pereskia bleo. The details of all close and remote homologs identified using the different sequence similarity approaches are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. An alignment of LhKNOT to the known structures of typical knottins as well as identified homologs showed the conservation of the six cysteines that form the three disulfide bridges in LhKNOT (Figure 1A). On its N-terminus, LhKNOT contains a long, helical segment predicted to function as a signal sequence; internally, it contains three beta-sheets, as expected of the secondary structure of knottin peptides (Figure 1B). Figure 1.

Identical residues are highlighted in red, while chemically similar residues are highlighted in yellow.

X and XX denote the variable number of residues at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. Secondary structure elements of the modeled LhKNOT are shown at the top. β and T represent β-strand, and β-turn, respectively.

The two disulfide bridges (green) form a macro-cycle, while a third (blue) pulls through the center giving the protein its namesake knotted topology. (D) Predicted tertiary structure of LhKNOT, showing the knotted topology and conserved cysteine motif, cysteine residues form disulfide bridges in the conserved pattern seen throughout the knottin family (C1-C4 and C2-C5 form the macro-cycle, C3-C6 pulls through the center).Additionally, an assessment of sequence similarity of LhKNOT targeted to the available L. heterotoma and L. boulardi transcripts and from another Drosophila parasitoid, Ganaspis spp. (see Methods), revealed an abundance of related sequences. For L. heterotoma (Lh14), we identified 16 additional Lh14 knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S2). For L. boulardi, we identified 22 knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S3). Six LhKNOT homologs were similarly identified from the Ganaspis hookeri (G1) and two LhKNOT homologs were found in the protein predictions made from the G. brasiliensis (VA) genome (Supplementary Table S4). Figure 2 shows the conservation of these parasitoid knottin sequences with LhKNOT. Thus, at least the few Drosophila parasitoids sampled in this study appear to encode multiple knottin proteins. Additional such knottin peptides may be encoded by these wasps, and systematic proteomic/bioinformatic approaches are needed to obtain a comprehensive list. The functions of these putative knottins in parasite physiology remain unknown. Figure 2. Open in a new tab (A) Multiple sequence alignment of LhKNOT (top) and homologs in Lh14.

Secondary structure elements of the modeled LhKNOT are shown at the top. β and T represent β-strand, and β-turn, respectively. Grey stars added on the top of blocks of sequences, above residues represent residues modeled with alternate conformations. 2.2. The Three-Dimensional Structure of LhKNOT The typical structural fold of a knottin peptide is defined by six cysteines involved in three disulfide bonds to form a cysteine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet [25]. An important characteristic of this fold is the connectivity of the cysteine residues to form the disulfide bridges and the disulfide bridge of cysteines 3 and 6 going through disulfides 1–4 and 2–5 to make a special disulfide through disulfide knot (Figure 1A,C). This disulfide, through a disulfide knot feature, distinguishes the knottin fold from other cysteine knot proteins. Other than the conserved cysteines, the rest of the amino acid sequence can be quite variable, and therefore, only a limited number of knottins are identified by sequence similarity approaches for LhKNOT (see the previous section and Supplementary Table S1). Fold recognition algorithms and template-based modeling approaches, on the other hand, retrieved several diverse knottins as suitable candidates for modeling LhKNOT. Among the various LhKNOT models generated, the best model was a multi-template-based model of LhKNOT created using the program HHpred [37] with structural restraints derived from the top three templates, Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [30], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [28], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [25]. Knowledge-based energy profiles calculated using ProSA-web [38] for this selected model showed low energies and a z-score of −4.53, which is comparable to solved structures. Verify3D [39] assessed this multi-template-based model with a passing score (100.00% of the residues in the model have an averaged 3D-1D score greater than or equal to 0.2). The VoroMQA [40] score of 0.325 is likely a reflection of the small size of the peptide and the scores of the templates were in the same range (Supplementary Figure S1). This multi-template-based model typifies the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta strands, constrained by disulfide bridges and the expected connectivity of disulfide bridges (Figure 1D). KNOTER3D, a tool in the KNOTTIN Database [36] corroborated that this model has a bona fide knottin fold and confirmed the previously identified disulfide bonding pattern in Figure 1D. 2.3. LhKNOT Shows the Presence of a CPC Clip, Capable of Interacting with Heparin and Other GAGs To search for potential LhKNOT functions, structure–function correlations of close structural homologs of LhKNOT were investigated. A knottin protein from the cactus Pereskia bleo (PDB: 5XBD) [26] possesses a heparin-binding motif known as the CPC clip. This structural motif forms a geometrically constrained clip of two cationic and one polar residues that interact with heparin by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds clamping it in position within the positively charged surface of the clip [41]. A structural superposition of the cactus knottin and LhKNOT showed that the two structures are highly similar, with an overall difference of less than 2Å. Docking analysis of LhKNOT with heparin, using ClusPro’s specific parameters for heparin as a ligand, revealed that for LhKNOT, the polar interactions fitting the CPC clip motif occur in residues R1-S3-R14 (Figure 3A). Measured distances (both between alpha-carbons and centers of mass of participating residue side chains) differed from those of the CPC clip by less than 1Å, suggesting the presence of a putative CPC clip in LhKNOT (Figure 3B). The surface electrostatics of the modeled LhKNOT also showed the presence of the expected cationic binding pocket formed by the CPC clip [41,42] (Figure 3C). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (A) Visualization of the CPC clip motif in LhKNOT. Hydrogen bonds between heparin (teal) and participating residues (Arg1, Ser3, Arg14) of LhKNOT (green) are indicated by dashed yellow lines. (B) Distances measured in PyMOL between the centers of mass of participating residues (grey pseudo-atoms) in the LhKNOT–heparin interaction. Distances are marked on the yellow dashed lines and fall within the expected value ranges of the CPC clip motif. (C) Surface electrostatics of LhKNOT, in complex with heparin. The positively charged surface formed by the cationic residues involved in the CPC clip allows for electrostatic interactions with the overall negatively charged heparin molecule. The surface electrostatic potentials are color-graded from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue).To assess the CPC clip’s ability to interact with other GAGs, additional docking analysis was performed with LhKNOT and keratan sulfate (PDB ID: 1KES) and with LhKNOT and hyaluronic acid (PDB ID: 1HYA). In both cases, the positively charged binding surface created by the CPC clip bound to the negatively charged molecules. Ligplots generated by PDBSum confirmed an association of the GAGs with the CPC-forming residues (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). 2.4. Other Structural Homologs of LhKNOT Also Contain the CPC Clip Motif Presence of the CPC clip in both LhKNOT and its structural homolog from Pereskia bleo (pB1) suggested the possibility of a broader conservation of the CPC clip within the knottin family. An analysis of 21 close structural homologs of LhKNOT with experimentally solved PDBs in the KNOTTIN database revealed that, in every case, the peptides possess the CPC clip motif. For most peptides (e.g., T. tridentatus), the motif parameters deviated less than 1Å from the core knottin fold, while for others (e.g., the offensive knottins), the deviation was up to a margin of 3Å (Supplementary Table S5). Similarly, modeled knottin proteins of the identified homologs showed that almost all of them possessed the CPC clip. Sixteen additional sequences from L. heterotoma, 22 sequences from L. boulardi, and 8 sequences from Ganaspis spp., with no known 3D structures, were modeled and analyzed for the presence of the CPC clip motif. While 13 of the 16 putative L. heterotoma knottins and 20 of 22 putative L. boulardi knottins revealed a CPC clip motif, all Ganaspis sequences contained the CPC clip (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, the seven homologs that did not exhibit a CPC clip motif belong to (a) the common pollen beetle sequence (B. aeneus (CAH0563829.1), (b) fungal sequence R. necatrix (A0A1S8A723), and (c) three L. heterotoma knottins 4,5,6 and L. boulardi knottins 3 and 20 (Supplementary Table S5). A survey of knottins in the KNOTTIN database, unrelated to LhKNOT, but representative of various taxa (cone snail, horseshoe crab, insect, plant, scorpion, and spider), showed the CPC clip motif. In all cases, the surface electrostatic profile of the CPC clip motif is positively charged, likely, to facilitate interactions with the negatively charged heparin (Figure 4). However, similar to the beetle, fungal, and wasp knottins described above, the CPC clip was not identified in knottins from the plant cyclotide and sponges (Supplementary Table S5). Figure 4.

In Silico Mutational Analysis of LhKNOT CPC Clip Reveals a Secondary CPC Clip Models of three in silico LhKNOT mutants (R1A, S3A, R14A) were investigated to compare binding interactions of wild type and mutant proteins. In the case of the R14A mutant, heparin was shown to surprisingly associate with a secondary CPC clip involving the R1, S3, R30 residues instead of the R1, S3, R14 motif in the wild type (Supplementary Figure S4). Double or triple mutants (R14A-R1A; R14A-S3A-R1A), however, did not show an interaction with any of the primary or secondary CPC clip motif residues (Supplementary Figure S4C,D). The in silico mutants with the R1A mutation (interrupting both the primary and secondary CPC clip motifs), however, did show heparin associating with R29 and R30, as they provide the only remaining cationic surface (Supplementary Figure S4C,D). Interestingly, the ligand prefers to associate with the CPC clip motif, both in the case of the primary and secondary clips, over this additional cationic surface when the motif is available, suggesting the specific interaction of the CPC clip may allow a more stable association over a non-specific electrostatic interaction. 2.6. A CPC Clip Is Also Present in the Antimicrobial Peptide Drosomycin Unlike LhKNOT, the structure of Drosomycin contains a different fold with an alpha-helix and a twisted three-stranded beta-sheet, which is stabilized by three disulfide bridges [43]. This structural motif, termed a “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif”, is also found in other host-defense proteins such as the antibacterial insect defensin A, scorpion toxins, plant thionins, and antifungal plant defensins [43,44]. Given the known antimicrobial function of Drosomycin and its related “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif” [43,44], we examined the possibility of a common basis for antimicrobial activity and shared structure–function relationships with LhKNOT to better understand the potential significance of this motif in LhKNOT in the context of host defense. Despite a slightly different structural fold, Drosomycin overlays within an RMSD of 2.2Å of both LhKNOT and pB1 (Figure 5A). When the previous CPC clip analysis was extended to Drosomycin, the results revealed the presence of the CPC clip motif in Drosomycin as well. The CPC clip motif in Drosomycin (R6-S4-K38) falls within a 2Å deviation of the motif parameters (Figure 5B, Supplementary Table S5). Additionally, surface electrostatics of Drosomycin confirmed the putative CPC clip’s formation of a cationic binding pocket as also observed for LhKNOT and other knottins (Figure 5C, Supplementary Table S5). These results suggest that there may be similarity in the mode of action of Drosomycin and LhKNOT and that the biochemistry embedded in this structural motif may drive antimicrobial function in both peptides.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion and Speculation Biochemical functions of proteins are facilitated by their overall structures, which are reportedly 3–10 times more well-conserved than their primary structures [45]. Consequently, sequence alignments often fall short in investigating the functional potential of proteins such as knottins, where the varied primary structures may obscure shared structure–function relationships. In silico methods facilitate broad analysis of potential structure–function correlations for such interesting folds [46,47,48,49,50]. Our detailed analysis of the LhKNOT structure and its structural homologs supports the idea that this parasite protein has the hallmarks of a knottin peptide with functions in host defense: (a) the closest matches to LhKNOT are antimicrobial peptides; (b) LhKNOT’s Pfam signature describes it as cysteine knotted “antifungal peptide”; and (c) a CPC clip is present. Analysis of a knottin wound-healing peptide bleogen pB1 from the leafy cactus Pereskia bleo initially revealed the presence of a CPC clip, a conserved structural signature of heparin-binding proteins [42]. It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant [51]. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic [52]. The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). This CPC clip motif is defined by distances between both the α carbons of the involved residues as well as the distances between the centers of mass of the involved residues. Heparin-binding proteins are known to interact promiscuously with other negatively charged substrates, most notably the surface membranes of microbes [41]. As a result, heparin-binding proteins can exhibit antimicrobial activity to varying degrees [53]. While the precise mechanisms of this antimicrobial potential are not well defined, it has been hypothesized that the CPC clip may facilitate these protein–microbe interactions [41]. New potential roles of heparin binding are emerging, such as in the potential therapeutic interventions for amyloidogenesis [54], so understanding the structural determinants of the CPC clip in diverse proteins may be key to delineating the mechanism of the interaction and its disruption. A clue to a possible antimicrobial mechanism for LhKNOT comes from our finding that its inhibitory cysteine knot and those of other knottins examined here have a CPC clip intrinsic to their folds (Supplementary Table S5). It has been noted that the structural and biophysical requirements for heparin-binding proteins’ ability to interact with heparin are strikingly similar to the structural features of many known AMPs [53]. Thus, the CPC clip motif may fit the criteria for both these requirements [41]. Our discovery of this CPC clip motif not only in LhKNOT but also in 75 other related or unrelated knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S5) suggests that this CPC clip motif may be a highly conserved feature of the knottin proteins. The coincident occurrence of the CPC clip motif within the cysteine knot structure in diverse proteins suggests that the CPC clip motif itself may underlie the antimicrobial function. However, because this structural motif is also identified in offensive knottins (Supplementary Table S5), it may also serve a more general role via this more generalized CPC clip interaction motif. The discovery of a putative CPC clip motif in Drosomycin is intriguing, as it sheds light on the possible mechanism of action of this antifungal peptide and supports a possible antimicrobial function for the CPC clip motif itself. Previous studies have shown the importance of Drosomycin’s residues R6 and K38, which are part of its CPC clip motif (R6-S4-K38), for its antifungal potential; alterations of these residues reduce antifungal activity [55]. Our structural analysis of the wasp LhKNOT and its similarities with Drosophila Drosomycin offers possible insights into the L. heterotoma’s ability to broadly suppress Toll-NF-κB pathway in D. melanogaster and yet succeed on immune-compromised hosts. In the absence of a functional Toll immune pathway, and consequently without Drosomycin production, Drosophila larvae can often succumb to opportunistic pathogens [11,13,56]. LhKNOT’s putative antimicrobial activities might defend the host from opportunistic microbial pathogens in wasp-infected, immune-compromised host larvae and developing pupae. Alternatively, similar to Drosomycin, LhKNOT could induce hemocyte apoptosis [57]. L. heterotoma EVs enter hemocytes after infection [58], and their activities within EVs compromise encapsulation [19,21]. The CPC clip has been shown to associate promiscuously with GAGs [41], which are nevertheless ubiquitous in insects including Drosophila [59]. Heparin sulfate GAGs in flies serve as growth factor receptors and participate in creating and maintaining morphogenic gradients [60]. The CPC clip has also been shown to associate promiscuously with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [41]. Bacterial LPS, being major surface components of Gram-negative bacteria, are extremely potent stimulators of the innate immune response in various eukaryotic species including insects [61]. GAGs in Drosophila also control the binding of α C protein, a virulence determinant of group B streptococcus [62]. Thus, it is possible that a CPC clip containing LhKNOT and Drosomycin (and possibly other fly AMPs, such as Defensin [63]) can modulate immune signaling (and/or binding to the pathogen’s virulence proteins), similarly affecting the bacterial pathogen/metazoan parasite outcome. Previous studies have shown that three homologous knottins (Alo-1, 2, 3) from the harlequin beetle Acrocinus longimanus are active against yeast, Candida glabrata [30]. Additionally, a pore-forming candidacidal peptide, Psacotheasin, attacks Candida albicans [64]. Lastly, a plant pathogenic rust fungus, Melampsora larici-populina, produces a knottin peptide as its own candidate effector [65]. Our finding that multiple putative knottin peptides may be secreted by adult parasitoid wasps of Drosophila was unexpected and intriguing. While their functions are not known, the possible existence of a knottin gene family suggests some redundancy in their functions that may be linked to the parasitic life history. The exploration of the knottin structural fold in unrelated and yet-to-be discovered knottins will prove to be valuable. Our work provides a short list of residues significant to the proposed physiological activity for knottin family protein investigation. Such information can be incorporated into rational drug discovery and design for infectious diseases and related therapies.",

Copyright notice ID: 9865768 PMID: 36678491 Abstract As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.

Introduction In host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [1,2]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [3]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [4,5,6,7]. The Leptopilina/Drosophila system is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [8]. To suppress host immunity, Leptopilina females introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [4,9,10]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms in Drosophila [11,12,13] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialist L. boulardi activates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as drosomycin is activated after L. boulardi infection [14]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [15,16], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [17,18]. In contrast, infection by the generalist L. heterotoma suppresses both immune pathways [9,14], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [19,20]. In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of an L. heterotoma peptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in the L. heterotoma venom but not in L. boulardi venom [21]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [21,22,23]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [24]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [25,26] to snails [27]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [28] and cone snail venom [27], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [26], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [25,26,29] and invertebrates [30]. The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence [30]. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design [30], potentially even for cancer treatments [31]. Various lines of experimental evidence demonstrate or suggest antimicrobial capabilities for different knottins [25,26,29,30,32,33] or gated ion channel interactions [28,34], although the molecular mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known if these antimicrobial functions share a common mechanism of action. Given its discovery from immune-suppressive particles from fly parasites, our goals were to (a) identify LhKNOT-related sequences from diverse organisms, including L. heterotoma, L. boulardi, and Ganaspis parasitoids, that attack Drosophila and (b) identify any novel structural motif(s) present in the known or new LhKNOT homologs with the hope that the prediction of such a conserved motif might suggest possible functions for LhKNOT and guide future experimental research. We show that a theoretical model of LhKNOT possesses the hallmarks of the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta sheets, constrained by disulfide bridges. The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation) [35]. Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs from L. heterotoma, L. boulardi, and Ganaspis spp. wasps successfully on D. melanogaster. These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from three Drosophila parasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions.2. Results 2.1. The LhKNOT Sequence Shows Similarity to Insect and Plant Antimicrobial Peptides A BLASTp search of the nr and TSA databases using the full-length LhKNOT sequence (60 amino acids) showed a limited number of significant hits, primarily annotated as “antimicrobial peptides”, from plants and insects. A few fungal sequences were also identified. All results displayed less than 60% amino acid identity to LhKNOT. The top match for LhKNOT in the nr database was an antimicrobial peptide from the common beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, while the top hit in the TSA database was an antimicrobial peptide from the wheat curl mite Aceria tosichella. The conservation was most prominent in the region of the only sequence motif associated with LhKNOT, the cysteine knotted ‘antifungal peptide’ signature (pfam11410 domain, E = 2.8 × 10−3). After running PSI-BLAST for detection of remote homologs, additional sequences were revealed. PSI-BLAST showed similar results with common ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; red mites, Dinothrombium tinctorium; parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma pretiosum; click beetle, Ignelater luminosus; parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma brassicae; common pollen beetle, Brassicogethes aeneus; ash borer, Agrilus planipennis; and sawfly, Neodiprion lecontei. Using the Hidden Markov Models-driven HMMER webserver as an alternative method of detecting remote homologs, we identified five fungal hits from Akanthomyces lecanii, Cordyceps javanica, Cordyceps confragosa, Rosellinia necatrix, and Beauveria bassiana. A search of the PDB for similar sequences retrieved only two significant results, one for a knottin-type antifungal peptide Alo-3 from the insect Acrocinus longimanus and the second from the disulfide-constrained wound healing peptide pB1 from Pereskia bleo. The details of all close and remote homologs identified using the different sequence similarity approaches are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. An alignment of LhKNOT to the known structures of typical knottins as well as identified homologs showed the conservation of the six cysteines that form the three disulfide bridges in LhKNOT (Figure 1A). On its N-terminus, LhKNOT contains a long, helical segment predicted to function as a signal sequence; internally, it contains three beta-sheets, as expected of the secondary structure of knottin peptides (Figure 1B).

(D) Predicted tertiary structure of LhKNOT, showing the knotted topology and conserved cysteine motif, cysteine residues form disulfide bridges in the conserved pattern seen throughout the knottin family (C1-C4 and C2-C5 form the macro-cycle, C3-C6 pulls through the center).Additionally, an assessment of sequence similarity of LhKNOT targeted to the available L. heterotoma and L. boulardi transcripts and from another Drosophila parasitoid, Ganaspis spp. (see Methods), revealed an abundance of related sequences. For L. heterotoma (Lh14), we identified 16 additional Lh14 knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S2). For L. boulardi, we identified 22 knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S3). Six LhKNOT homologs were similarly identified from the Ganaspis hookeri (G1) and two LhKNOT homologs were found in the protein predictions made from the G. brasiliensis (VA) genome (Supplementary Table S4). Figure 2 shows the conservation of these parasitoid knottin sequences with LhKNOT. Thus, at least the few Drosophila parasitoids sampled in this study appear to encode multiple knottin proteins. Additional such knottin peptides may be encoded by these wasps, and systematic proteomic/bioinformatic approaches are needed to obtain a comprehensive list. The functions of these putative knottins in parasite physiology remain unknown. Figure 2. Open in a new tab (A) Multiple sequence alignment of LhKNOT (top) and homologs in Lh14.

Grey stars added on the top of blocks of sequences, above residues represent residues modeled with alternate conformations.2.2. The Three-Dimensional Structure of LhKNOT The typical structural fold of a knottin peptide is defined by six cysteines involved in three disulfide bonds to form a cysteine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet [25]. An important characteristic of this fold is the connectivity of the cysteine residues to form the disulfide bridges and the disulfide bridge of cysteines 3 and 6 going through disulfides 1–4 and 2–5 to make a special disulfide through disulfide knot (Figure 1A,C). This disulfide, through a disulfide knot feature, distinguishes the knottin fold from other cysteine knot proteins. Other than the conserved cysteines, the rest of the amino acid sequence can be quite variable, and therefore, only a limited number of knottins are identified by sequence similarity approaches for LhKNOT (see the previous section and Supplementary Table S1). Fold recognition algorithms and template-based modeling approaches, on the other hand, retrieved several diverse knottins as suitable candidates for modeling LhKNOT. Among the various LhKNOT models generated, the best model was a multi-template-based model of LhKNOT created using the program HHpred [37] with structural restraints derived from the top three templates, Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [30], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [28], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [25]. Knowledge-based energy profiles calculated using ProSA-web [38] for this selected model showed low energies and a z-score of −4.53, which is comparable to solved structures. Verify3D [39] assessed this multi-template-based model with a passing score (100.00% of the residues in the model have an averaged 3D-1D score greater than or equal to 0.2). The VoroMQA [40] score of 0.325 is likely a reflection of the small size of the peptide and the scores of the templates were in the same range (Supplementary Figure S1). This multi-template-based model typifies the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta strands, constrained by disulfide bridges and the expected connectivity of disulfide bridges (Figure 1D). KNOTER3D, a tool in the KNOTTIN Database [36] corroborated that this model has a bona fide knottin fold and confirmed the previously identified disulfide bonding pattern in Figure 1D.2.3. LhKNOT Shows the Presence of a CPC Clip, Capable of Interacting with Heparin and Other GAGs To search for potential LhKNOT functions, structure–function correlations of close structural homologs of LhKNOT were investigated. A knottin protein from the cactus Pereskia bleo (PDB: 5XBD) [26] possesses a heparin-binding motif known as the CPC clip. This structural motif forms a geometrically constrained clip of two cationic and one polar residues that interact with heparin by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds clamping it in position within the positively charged surface of the clip [41]. A structural superposition of the cactus knottin and LhKNOT showed that the two structures are highly similar, with an overall difference of less than 2Å. Docking analysis of LhKNOT with heparin, using ClusPro’s specific parameters for heparin as a ligand, revealed that for LhKNOT, the polar interactions fitting the CPC clip motif occur in residues R1-S3-R14 (Figure 3A). Measured distances (both between alpha-carbons and centers of mass of participating residue side chains) differed from those of the CPC clip by less than 1Å, suggesting the presence of a putative CPC clip in LhKNOT (Figure 3B). The surface electrostatics of the modeled LhKNOT also showed the presence of the expected cationic binding pocket formed by the CPC clip [41,42] (Figure 3C). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (A) Visualization of the CPC clip motif in LhKNOT. Hydrogen bonds between heparin (teal) and participating residues (Arg1, Ser3, Arg14) of LhKNOT (green) are indicated by dashed yellow lines. (B) Distances measured in PyMOL between the centers of mass of participating residues (grey pseudo-atoms) in the LhKNOT–heparin interaction. Distances are marked on the yellow dashed lines and fall within the expected value ranges of the CPC clip motif. (C) Surface electrostatics of LhKNOT, in complex with heparin. The positively charged surface formed by the cationic residues involved in the CPC clip allows for electrostatic interactions with the overall negatively charged heparin molecule. The surface electrostatic potentials are color-graded from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue).To assess the CPC clip’s ability to interact with other GAGs, additional docking analysis was performed with LhKNOT and keratan sulfate (PDB ID: 1KES) and with LhKNOT and hyaluronic acid (PDB ID: 1HYA). In both cases, the positively charged binding surface created by the CPC clip bound to the negatively charged molecules. Ligplots generated by PDBSum confirmed an association of the GAGs with the CPC-forming residues (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).2.4. Other Structural Homologs of LhKNOT Also Contain the CPC Clip Motif Presence of the CPC clip in both LhKNOT and its structural homolog from Pereskia bleo (pB1) suggested the possibility of a broader conservation of the CPC clip within the knottin family. An analysis of 21 close structural homologs of LhKNOT with experimentally solved PDBs in the KNOTTIN database revealed that, in every case, the peptides possess the CPC clip motif. For most peptides (e.g., T. tridentatus), the motif parameters deviated less than 1Å from the core knottin fold, while for others (e.g., the offensive knottins), the deviation was up to a margin of 3Å (Supplementary Table S5). Similarly, modeled knottin proteins of the identified homologs showed that almost all of them possessed the CPC clip. Sixteen additional sequences from L. heterotoma, 22 sequences from L. boulardi, and 8 sequences from Ganaspis spp., with no known 3D structures, were modeled and analyzed for the presence of the CPC clip motif. While 13 of the 16 putative L. heterotoma knottins and 20 of 22 putative L. boulardi knottins revealed a CPC clip motif, all Ganaspis sequences contained the CPC clip (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, the seven homologs that did not exhibit a CPC clip motif belong to (a) the common pollen beetle sequence (B. aeneus (CAH0563829.1), (b) fungal sequence R. necatrix (A0A1S8A723), and (c) three L. heterotoma knottins 4,5,6 and L. boulardi knottins 3 and 20 (Supplementary Table S5). A survey of knottins in the KNOTTIN database, unrelated to LhKNOT, but representative of various taxa (cone snail, horseshoe crab, insect, plant, scorpion, and spider), showed the CPC clip motif. In all cases, the surface electrostatic profile of the CPC clip motif is positively charged, likely, to facilitate interactions with the negatively charged heparin (Figure 4). However, similar to the beetle, fungal, and wasp knottins described above, the CPC clip was not identified in knottins from the plant cyclotide and sponges (Supplementary Table S5). Figure 4.

In Silico Mutational Analysis of LhKNOT CPC Clip Reveals a Secondary CPC Clip Models of three in silico LhKNOT mutants (R1A, S3A, R14A) were investigated to compare binding interactions of wild type and mutant proteins. In the case of the R14A mutant, heparin was shown to surprisingly associate with a secondary CPC clip involving the R1, S3, R30 residues instead of the R1, S3, R14 motif in the wild type (Supplementary Figure S4). Double or triple mutants (R14A-R1A; R14A-S3A-R1A), however, did not show an interaction with any of the primary or secondary CPC clip motif residues (Supplementary Figure S4C,D). The in silico mutants with the R1A mutation (interrupting both the primary and secondary CPC clip motifs), however, did show heparin associating with R29 and R30, as they provide the only remaining cationic surface (Supplementary Figure S4C,D). Interestingly, the ligand prefers to associate with the CPC clip motif, both in the case of the primary and secondary clips, over this additional cationic surface when the motif is available, suggesting the specific interaction of the CPC clip may allow a more stable association over a non-specific electrostatic interaction.2.6. A CPC Clip Is Also Present in the Antimicrobial Peptide Drosomycin Unlike LhKNOT, the structure of Drosomycin contains a different fold with an alpha-helix and a twisted three-stranded beta-sheet, which is stabilized by three disulfide bridges [43]. This structural motif, termed a “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif”, is also found in other host-defense proteins such as the antibacterial insect defensin A, scorpion toxins, plant thionins, and antifungal plant defensins [43,44]. Given the known antimicrobial function of Drosomycin and its related “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif” [43,44], we examined the possibility of a common basis for antimicrobial activity and shared structure–function relationships with LhKNOT to better understand the potential significance of this motif in LhKNOT in the context of host defense. Despite a slightly different structural fold, Drosomycin overlays within an RMSD of 2.2Å of both LhKNOT and pB1 (Figure 5A). When the previous CPC clip analysis was extended to Drosomycin, the results revealed the presence of the CPC clip motif in Drosomycin as well. The CPC clip motif in Drosomycin (R6-S4-K38) falls within a 2Å deviation of the motif parameters (Figure 5B, Supplementary Table S5). Additionally, surface electrostatics of Drosomycin confirmed the putative CPC clip’s formation of a cationic binding pocket as also observed for LhKNOT and other knottins (Figure 5C, Supplementary Table S5). These results suggest that there may be similarity in the mode of action of Drosomycin and LhKNOT and that the biochemistry embedded in this structural motif may drive antimicrobial function in both peptides. Figure 5. Open in a new tab (A) Superposition of LhKNOT (blue), wound-healing peptide of Pereskia bleo (tan; pB1;cactus; PDB: 5XBD) and Drosomycin (green; Drosomycin; fly; PDB: 1MYN).

Distances fall within 2Å of the value ranges of the CPC clip motif.

The surface electrostatic potentials are color-graded from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue).3. Discussion and Speculation Biochemical functions of proteins are facilitated by their overall structures, which are reportedly 3–10 times more well-conserved than their primary structures [45]. Consequently, sequence alignments often fall short in investigating the functional potential of proteins such as knottins, where the varied primary structures may obscure shared structure–function relationships. In silico methods facilitate broad analysis of potential structure–function correlations for such interesting folds [46,47,48,49,50]. Our detailed analysis of the LhKNOT structure and its structural homologs supports the idea that this parasite protein has the hallmarks of a knottin peptide with functions in host defense: (a) the closest matches to LhKNOT are antimicrobial peptides; (b) LhKNOT’s Pfam signature describes it as cysteine knotted “antifungal peptide”; and (c) a CPC clip is present. Analysis of a knottin wound-healing peptide bleogen pB1 from the leafy cactus Pereskia bleo initially revealed the presence of a CPC clip, a conserved structural signature of heparin-binding proteins [42]. It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant [51]. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic [52]. The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). This CPC clip motif is defined by distances between both the α carbons of the involved residues as well as the distances between the centers of mass of the involved residues. Heparin-binding proteins are known to interact promiscuously with other negatively charged substrates, most notably the surface membranes of microbes [41]. As a result, heparin-binding proteins can exhibit antimicrobial activity to varying degrees [53]. While the precise mechanisms of this antimicrobial potential are not well defined, it has been hypothesized that the CPC clip may facilitate these protein–microbe interactions [41]. New potential roles of heparin binding are emerging, such as in the potential therapeutic interventions for amyloidogenesis [54], so understanding the structural determinants of the CPC clip in diverse proteins may be key to delineating the mechanism of the interaction and its disruption. A clue to a possible antimicrobial mechanism for LhKNOT comes from our finding that its inhibitory cysteine knot and those of other knottins examined here have a CPC clip intrinsic to their folds (Supplementary Table S5). It has been noted that the structural and biophysical requirements for heparin-binding proteins’ ability to interact with heparin are strikingly similar to the structural features of many known AMPs [53]. Thus, the CPC clip motif may fit the criteria for both these requirements [41]. Our discovery of this CPC clip motif not only in LhKNOT but also in 75 other related or unrelated knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S5) suggests that this CPC clip motif may be a highly conserved feature of the knottin proteins. The coincident occurrence of the CPC clip motif within the cysteine knot structure in diverse proteins suggests that the CPC clip motif itself may underlie the antimicrobial function. However, because this structural motif is also identified in offensive knottins (Supplementary Table S5), it may also serve a more general role via this more generalized CPC clip interaction motif. The discovery of a putative CPC clip motif in Drosomycin is intriguing, as it sheds light on the possible mechanism of action of this antifungal peptide and supports a possible antimicrobial function for the CPC clip motif itself. Previous studies have shown the importance of Drosomycin’s residues R6 and K38, which are part of its CPC clip motif (R6-S4-K38), for its antifungal potential; alterations of these residues reduce antifungal activity [55]. Our structural analysis of the wasp LhKNOT and its similarities with Drosophila Drosomycin offers possible insights into the L. heterotoma’s ability to broadly suppress Toll-NF-κB pathway in D. melanogaster and yet succeed on immune-compromised hosts. In the absence of a functional Toll immune pathway, and consequently without Drosomycin production, Drosophila larvae can often succumb to opportunistic pathogens [11,13,56]. LhKNOT’s putative antimicrobial activities might defend the host from opportunistic microbial pathogens in wasp-infected, immune-compromised host larvae and developing pupae. Alternatively, similar to Drosomycin, LhKNOT could induce hemocyte apoptosis [57]. L. heterotoma EVs enter hemocytes after infection [58], and their activities within EVs compromise encapsulation [19,21]. The CPC clip has been shown to associate promiscuously with GAGs [41], which are nevertheless ubiquitous in insects including Drosophila [59]. Heparin sulfate GAGs in flies serve as growth factor receptors and participate in creating and maintaining morphogenic gradients [60]. The CPC clip has also been shown to associate promiscuously with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [41]. Bacterial LPS, being major surface components of Gram-negative bacteria, are extremely potent stimulators of the innate immune response in various eukaryotic species including insects [61]. GAGs in Drosophila also control the binding of α C protein, a virulence determinant of group B streptococcus [62]. Thus, it is possible that a CPC clip containing LhKNOT and Drosomycin (and possibly other fly AMPs, such as Defensin [63]) can modulate immune signaling (and/or binding to the pathogen’s virulence proteins), similarly affecting the bacterial pathogen/metazoan parasite outcome. Previous studies have shown that three homologous knottins (Alo-1, 2, 3) from the harlequin beetle Acrocinus longimanus are active against yeast, Candida glabrata [30]. Additionally, a pore-forming candidacidal peptide, Psacotheasin, attacks Candida albicans [64]. Lastly, a plant pathogenic rust fungus, Melampsora larici-populina, produces a knottin peptide as its own candidate effector [65]. Our finding that multiple putative knottin peptides may be secreted by adult parasitoid wasps of Drosophila was unexpected and intriguing. While their functions are not known, the possible existence of a knottin gene family suggests some redundancy in their functions that may be linked to the parasitic life history. The exploration of the knottin structural fold in unrelated and yet-to-be discovered knottins will prove to be valuable. Our work provides a short list of residues significant to the proposed physiological activity for knottin family protein investigation. Such information can be incorporated into rational drug discovery and design for infectious diseases and related therapies.4. Methods 4.1. Sequence Analysis Initial scans of the  non-redundant protein sequence (nr) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein; accessed on 4 April 2018), the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa; accessed on 16 April 2018) [66], and the Protein Data Bank (PDB; https://www.rcsb.org; accessed on 5 July 2018) [67] with the full-length amino acid sequence of the L. heterotoma knottin peptide (GAJC01011813.1) using  BLAST (BLASTp; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 16 April 2018) [68] were used to retrieve related protein sequences in other organisms. Remote homologs were searched using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 4 April 2022) [69], and Hidden Markov Models (HMMER; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer; accessed on 6 April 2022) [70,71]. BLAST searches were adjusted to word size 2, and scoring matrix BLOSUM45, while default parameters were used for HMMER. To identify knottin homologs in select Leptopilina and Ganaspis spp. not accessible in the protein databases, targeted searches using translated BLASTs against genomic and transcriptomic datasets were employed. To identify additional L. heterotoma knottins, the L. heterotoma female abdominal transcriptome GAJC [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GHUQ (GenBank Accession: GHUP00000000;TSA: Leptopilina heterotoma strain Lh14, transcriptome shotgun) and Space GHUP (GenBank Accession: GHUQ00000000;TSA: Leptopilina heterotoma strain Lh14, transcriptome shotgun) were searched using tblastn (e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM62, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. The following transcriptomes were similarly searched to identify L. boulardi knottins: L. boulardi female abdominal transcriptome GAJA [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GITC (GenBank Accession: GITC00000000; TSA: Leptopilina boulardi strain Lb17, transcriptome shotgun), Space GISX (GenBank Accession: GISX00000000; TSA: Leptopilina boulardi strain Lb17, transcriptome shotgun), and GGGI00000000 (female abdomen/head) [73]. In addition, targeted searches for Ganaspis spp. homologs were carried out. For G. hookeri, the GAIW00000000 TSA: Ganaspis spp. G1 dataset [74] was searched (tblastn, e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM45, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) using the LhKNOT query. The Expasy tool (web.expasy.org/translate/; accessed on 9 December 2022) was used to translate these TSA sequences [75]. The resulting predicted peptide sequences were manually curated based on the presence of the cysteine motif. For G. brasiliensis, AUGUSTUS-based (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus; accessed on 9 April 2020) [76] gene predictions from the partially assembled genomic sequence (Gen-Bank:GCA_009823575.1) were made using the Nasonia vitripenis genome training module. The resulting predicted proteins were searched using blastp (e-value threshold set to 1, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. Alignments and visualization were performed using EBI’s Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo; accessed on 9 December 2022) [77] to confirm the presence of the knottin motif and for further curation of the sequences. The set of identified sequences were aligned to LhKNOT to create a multiple sequence alignment using T-COFFEE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/tcoffee; accessed on 9 December 2022) [78] and visualized using ESPript3 (https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php; accessed on 9 December 2022) [79] to identify any conserved residues and/or motif(s) in the aligned sequences.4.2. LhKNOT Primary Structure Analysis The LhKNOT sequence was also analyzed by the domain/motif detection database Conserved Domain Database (CDD; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml; accessed on 6 April 2018) and Pfam (pfam.xfam.org; accessed on 6 April 2018) to identify any domains or sequence signatures [80,81]. The sequence was further analyzed using the signal sequence prediction software SignalP-5.0 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-5.0; accessed on 6 April 2018) [82] and Phobius (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/phobius; accessed on 6 April 2018) [83] to identify the location of the signal sequence and allow for a more accurate characterization of the peptide. The mature peptide of 36 amino acids (with the predicted signal sequence, residues 1–24, removed) was used for further analysis. The secondary structure of the peptide was predicted using the meta-server Sympred (https://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/sympredwww; accessed on 6 April 2018) [84] and analyzed to confirm its correspondence to the expected secondary structure for a knottin fold: an initial alpha-helical segment (predicted signal sequence) followed by three anti-parallel beta strands.4.3. Tertiary Structure Prediction and Evaluation of LhKNOT and Its Homologs The programs I-Tasser (https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER; accessed on 16 April 2018) [85], Modeller (https://salilab.org/modeller; accessed on 16 April 2018) [86], and HHPred (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred; accessed on 6 April 2018) [37] were used to model the tertiary structure of LhKNOT. Three structural homologs with the knottin-like fold Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [30], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [28], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [25] were identified as top candidates and used as templates in model building programs. The predicted model for LhKNOT was evaluated by Verify3D (https://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/verify3d; accessed on 18 April 2018) [39], VoroMQA (https://bioinformatics.lt/wtsam/voromqa; accessed on 18 April 2018) [40], and Prosa-web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php; accessed on 18 April 2018) [38]. Evaluating small peptides with standard evaluation tools can have limitations. Thus, scores from solved tertiary structures of NMR and crystallography-derived peptides of similar size and shape (PDB: 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) were used to interpret the evaluation scores of our LhKNOT models. The top-ranked model was created using HHPred [37], a modeling program that uses the underlying model-building program, Modeller [86] using a restraint-based comparative modeling approach. In addition, the KNOTTIN database’s KNOTER3D tool (https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/KNOTTIN/knoter3d.php; accessed on 15 May 2020) [36] was used to evaluate the model’s tertiary structure, confirming LhKNOT’s adoption of the Knottin fold. All the identified homologs with no known structures were modeled using the top template identified in HHPred [37].4.4. CPC Clip Motif Identification Superposition of LhKNOT’s structural model with the known structures of a CPC clip containing knottin peptide from the cactus Pereskia bleo (PDB: 5XBD) [26] using the programs Superpose (http://superpose.wishartlab.com; accessed on 12 September 2018) [87] and MultiProt (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt; accessed on 12 September 2018) [88] suggested the presence of a heparin-binding CPC clip motif. To confirm the presence of the CPC clip in LhKNOT, docking analysis using the program, ClusPro 2.0 (which offers parameters specific to heparin as ligand; https://cluspro.org; accessed on 2 March 2019) [89], and subsequent analysis of predicted docking scenarios in the visualization program, PyMOL (https://pymol.org; accessed on 10 March 2019) [90] was performed. All potential docking scenarios were analyzed for identifying residues forming the putative CPC clip motif using the following steps. All polar interactions between LhKNOT and heparin were visualized in PyMOL and lists of participating residues were compiled. Predictions that contained the necessary Cation–Polar–Cation interactions were then further scrutinized for adherence to the CPC clip motif parameter by measuring distances between alpha carbons of participating residues as well as distances between center of mass of participating residues. PyMOL’s “Measurements” Wizard tool was used to measure distances between α-carbons of the participating residues. To evaluate the distances between centers of mass, a user-generated script available in the pymolwiki website (Henschel, https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Center_of_mass; accessed on 15 March 2019) was used to generate pseudo-atoms at the calculated sidechain center of mass. PyMOL’s APBS Electrostatics Plugin [91] was used to render the surface electrostatics for the modeled LhKNOT. Similar steps were carried out to identify the CPC clip motif in each of the remaining knottin proteins in Supplementary Table S5.4.5. Association of LhKNOT with Other GAGs To assess whether the CPC clip would facilitate binding with additional GAGs, further docking was performed with hyaluronic acid (PDB: 1HYA) and keratan sulfate (PDB: 1KES). In the case of hyaluronic acid, extraneous atoms (O, Na) were removed from the space surrounding the molecule. Keratan sulfate’s model was used as is. Docking was performed using AutoDock (https://autodock.scripps.edu; accessed on 7 April 2020) [92], and results were visualized in PyMOL. Results were then input into PDBSum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html; accessed on 10 April 2020) [93] to generate Ligplots to confirm GAG-CPC clip binding.4.6. Protein-Heparin Docking Analysis for Mutated CPC Clip in LhKNOT To investigate the importance of the CPC clip in heparin binding, mutated models of LhKNOT were generated using PyMOL’s mutagenesis tool, substituting the CPC clip residues with alanine. Models were created piecewise, first substituting just R14, then R1 and R14, and finally R14, R1, and S3. Heparin docking of all models was performed using ClusPro, and analysis was performed as described previously.4.7. Protein-Heparin Docking Analysis in Structural Homologs and Drosomycin To further evaluate the presence of the CPC clip motif in the knottin peptide family, the previous methods were further expanded to (a) structural homologs of LhKNOT (PDB: 5XBD, 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) [25,26,28,30]; (b) Drosophila Drosomycin (PDB: 1MYN) [43], a peptide with known antifungal activity; (c) modeled homologous knottin proteins, and (d) representative knottins from different categories in the KNOTTIN database. Results were considered to adhere to the motif if measurements fell within 3Å of the CPC clip parameters, to allow for some flexibility of protein loop conformations.Acknowledgments We are grateful to Brian Wey for help with G. brasiliensis gene predictions and S.A.

    "abstract": "Summary While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth.

    "introduction": "Introduction As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3 These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight on D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission. Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5 The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6 This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7 Encapsulation of the parasite egg by Drosophila larvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful. Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8 Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10 Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12 L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh.8,13 Lb EVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to Lh EVs.13,14,15,16 There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.12 While the venom EVs from both Lb and Lh are immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly. Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17 Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19 Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20 Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21 In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains: one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22,23,24 Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23,24,25,26 In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue.27,28 Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin administration.24 Thus, the hopTum-l background is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22,23,24 In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30 The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of space L. heterotoma. Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32 Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",

Experimental model and study participant details Experimental design and sample preparation D. melanogaster strains y1 w1 and y w hopTum-l msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-l msn > GFP),24 and wasp species L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) and L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14),8 were included in the ground control and flight experiments. The hopTum-l strain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog, hopscotch.22 This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, the misshapen (msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62 Expression of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors. Extensive pre-flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day flight period. Six conditions (two fly-only cultures, four fly/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The fly-only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12 mL ± 1 mL fly food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL ± 1 mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum. Prior to launch, y w fly-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. The hopTum-l cultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For the y w co-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg-laying. For hopTum-l egg-lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch.Mission and hardware details Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63 Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule. A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York.Condition of insect cultures Visual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the fly food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 fly-only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufficient early instar larvae to set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures developed under corresponding conditions, while adult fly samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials. Method details Survival studies Animals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For fly-only cultures, statistical analysis was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co-cultures, statistical analysis was performed on the number of flies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete. The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.Dissections, staining, and imaging Depending on sample availability, 5–15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, staining, and imaging were previously published.64,65,66,67 Lymph glands were counter-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). For Lh-infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti-p40 antibody9,20 (1:1000) was used. Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging software in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected using the Magnafire-SP software.Mitotic index Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l adult flies (described above) were set up at 25°C. Three to five wandering third-instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 μg/mL BCIP and 250 μg/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.Adult tumorigenesis Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0 hopTum-l adults (20 males and 5–10 females, ∼22°C) were scored 6.5 days (25°C) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0 hopTum-l flies was reared at 27°C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-lay.24 Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student’s t test was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other.Infection and larval host immunity assay Egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l flies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25°C for 3 days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times. Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions. hopTum-l tumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight’s effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small- and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae. Uninfected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.Bulk RNA-Seq sample preparation methods For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer. For adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0 y w; (b) S0 y w; (c) G0 hopTum-l; (d) S0 hopTum-l were used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0 Lb17 and Lh14 wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1 y w animals. In addition, RNA was also extracted from hopTum-l larvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (d) S0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i) G0 Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0 Lh-infected S1 hosts. The RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2 × 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was ∼300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane. The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at −80°C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).Processing of Drosophila RNA-Seq data The reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. D. melanogaster STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A majority (90.08%–94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the fly reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69 median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Analysis of Drosophila RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples DEGs in adult fly samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.070 and the Drosophila database (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13). EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular function.71 Results were visualized by R package.72Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding ∼280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these ∼280 genes were examined in FlyBase37 and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from ∼3- to 12-fold. For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76 Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41 which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78 For larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA-Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA-Seq results above.Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. L. heterotoma Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and the Lh14 GAJC contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz). L. boulardi Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, with Lb17 GAJA contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz). Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) for Lb17 and Lh14 were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressed Lb17 and Lh14 DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20 - 59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (Tables S2 and S3).Analysis of parasite RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.Identification and analysis of parasite EV transcripts Proteins from purified Lb17 EV have not been characterized, but the composition of purified EVs from the Lb Gotheron (LbG) strain is published.14 To identify differentially expressed Lb17 EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383 LbG EV proteins, we queried the LbG EV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressed Lb17 transcripts in space (Table S2; LbG EV query sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, ’s tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62; gap costs existence extension 1, filtered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E-value ≤1 e−30, query coverage ≥50%, and percent identity of ≥50% were scored as high confidence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table 1), either due to their high log (2)-FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E = 3.00 e−100, query coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E = 4.00 e−30, query coverage 57%, and % identity 32.69). An estimate of the overall Lb17 EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383 LbG sequences were used to tblastn-search the GAJA00000000 sequences.47 This search identified 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E ≤ 1 e−50, query coverage ≥70%, percent identity ≥70%;  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81 Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of the LbG EV proteins are expressed in the Lb17 female abdomen. Since the Lh14 EV proteome is already characterized,11,12 tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310 Lh14 DEGs (Table 2).SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60°C oven for 2 h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.Virulence assay for Lh14 venom Forty hopTum-l larvae were bled in 200 μL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 μL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0 Lh14 wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 μg of venom protein was added to the slide chamber with hopTum-l hemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4 h at 25°C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’s t test statistic was applied to determine the significance.Isolation and characterization of L. heterotoma mutants G0/S0 Lb17 and Lh14 male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0 Lb17 or G0 Lh14 screens. One Lh14 grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. This aurum1 male was mated with “lab” females; the progeny was “selfed” to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. The aurum1 strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock was established. A second mutant phenotype was observed in the aurum1 wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of this aurum1 wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant, kona1, assorted from the aurum1 mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygous kona1 females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11 kona1 male-mated, heterozygous or homozygous kona1 females, were introduced to y w hosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs. To examine if aurum1 and kona1 mutations assort independently, unmated homozygous aurum1 females were mated with kona1 males. Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds of y w infections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored. Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous kona1 females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygous kona1 females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope. Quantification and statistical analysis Sample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corresponding figure legend. For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (± standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean ± standard error was calculated, and a Student’s t test was used to determine biological significance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight compromises y w but not hopTum-l emergence Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Figure 1A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host-parasite scuffle, naive hosts or Lb17-/Lh14-infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions (Figures 1B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures (fly strains y w and y w, hopTum-l) and four fly/parasite co-cultures on each host strain (Figure 1D). Survival of animals was scored post-flight (see STAR Methods). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The FFL-03 experimental design (A) D. melanogaster adults (top left) and larva (bottom left) imaged together with parasitoid wasps (bottom right). Female wasps have shorter antennae than males (right). (B) Vented fly box (VFB) with 15 holding slots for fly vials. (C) Six VFBs in one cargo transfer bag (CTB). Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew. The ISS flight conditions were mirrored at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory, where ground control samples were housed for the duration of the mission. (D) The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures and four fly/wasp co-cultures, as shown. See STAR methods for more details.We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared flies (Figures 2A–2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co-culture vials (Figures 2D and 2E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Survival of flies and wasps in ground control (G0) and space (S0) samples (A–C) The average numbers of adult male (A), adult female (B), and all adult (C) flies per vial in naive y w and hopTum-l cultures. The number of animals, averaged from 14 vials, is shown below. Error bars show standard error. y w males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 86 ± 3 and 39 ± 5; p ≤ 2.23 × 10−8. hopTum-l males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 44 ± 5 and 57 ± 3; p = 0.03. y w females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 105 ± 4 and 63 ± 4; p = 1.03 × 10−8. hopTum-l females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 53 ± 7 and 51 ± 3; p = 0.74. Total y w adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 260 ± 8 and 151 ± 10; p = 5.38 × 10−10. Total hopTum-l adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 122 ± 15 and 129 ± 6; p = 0.38. (D and E) The number of G0 adult flies (D) and wasps (E) per vial in fly-wasp co-cultures. Error bars show standard error. G0 y w from Lb infections = 7 ± 7; S0 y w from Lb infections = 36 ± 14; p = 0.07. G0 y w from Lh infections = 10 ± 9; S0 y w from Lh infections = 0.36 ± 0.17; p = 0.33. G0 Lb on y w hosts = 38 ± 5; S0 Lb on y w hosts = 41 ± 5; p = 0.31. G0 Lb on hopTum-l hosts = 14 ± 4; S0 Lb on hopTum-l hosts = 15 ± 3; p = 0.78. G0 Lh on y w hosts = 75 ± 7; S0 Lh on y w hosts = 84 ± 9; p = 0.48. G0 Lh on hopTum-l hosts = 10 ± 2; S0 Lh on hopTum-l hosts = 14 ± 3; p = 0.26. See also Figure S9. Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1). Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0 hopTum-l compared to y w flies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w and hopTum-l flies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1F. Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories (Figures 3A–3F). In the first category (Figures 3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases (Figure 3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure 3B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures 3A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns in hopTum-l and y w flies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0 hopTum-l vs. G0 y w. Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes34,35 (TotM and Tep1 family members, SPH93, and CG18563). Lectin-24A is predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3.36 Notable DEGs in panel (B) with disease-relevant human orthologs are CG32379, CG32318, and CG30059.37 (C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) genes in S0 y w versus G0 y w. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in these profiles. The fly histone H1s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia38) and CG6431, a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes), are downregulated (D). (E) Genes in hopTum-l whose expression is activated in space. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in this profile. CG3108 is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5.37 (F) Genes in y w and hopTum-l whose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle-related and flight-related genes are included. Flight-related genes are CG34327 (associated with abnormal flight), flightin (fln), and Troponin C isoform 4 (TpnC4). See also Figure S1.In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures 3C–3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response-related proteins (Figure 3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w flies but not in S0 hopTum-l flies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family (yellow-g, yellow-g2, yellow-e3), bearded gene family (Brd, Tom, BobA), Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb, Cp7Fc, Cp16, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38, Mur11Da; Figure 3D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary.39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight-related genes (e.g., flightin [fln] and Troponin C isoform 4 [TpnC4]; Figure 3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle40 are sensitive to spaceflight. Essential genes are downregulated in y w flies exposed to spaceflight To further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated, Figure 4A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41 The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See also Figure S1.The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y w space-flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617, with log2-(FC) < −1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l flies. Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0 y w flies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hopTum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes),42 both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hopTum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C). Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hopTum-l transcriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w flies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B). Since the hopTum-l mutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected in hopTum-l flies relative to y w flies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E, TotA, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, and CG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA, diedel, et, and CG4793 in hopTum-l versus y w were maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37 as follows: upd2 and upd3 are ligands; CycD, CycE, and Cdk2 are positive regulators; diedel, Socs36E, and et are negative regulators. The target genes are TotA, Idgf1, pirk, mfas, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, CG10764, CG15211, and Gf. (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See also Figures S1 and S2.Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hopTum-l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2 and upd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA, Gf, mfas, and CG15211) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046, Toll-9, Figure 5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA, SB1, SD, Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2, 3, 5) were also activated in S0 hopTum-l versus G0 hopTum-l flies (Figure 5D). To examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0 hopTum-l adults (Figure 6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6B and 6C). In 25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 ± 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 ± 0.40 in S0 flies (Figure 6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure 6E). Tumors were not detected in S0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Tumor burden in naive G0/S0 hopTum-l fly adults (A) Experimental design for space and ground hopTum-l flies for post-flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (see STAR methods) at 22°C, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. (B and C) Representative G1 hopTum-l adult female (B) and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large. (D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’s t test; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1 hopTum-l adult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’s t test). See also Figures S1 and S2. High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae As in the mutant hopTum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively (Figures S3A–S3E). Thus, in hopTum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling. We assessed if naive S1 y w or hopTum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight-responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764, LUBEL, PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b, and AMP genes, CecB, AttC, Drs, and Drsl5 (Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hopTum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA, DptB, CecA2, Drsl3, Drsl5, and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts (Figure S3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74 ± 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 ± 0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53).

Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. (B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T + E scores (see STAR methods). Lb17 wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. p values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See also Figures S3–S7. Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hopTum-l hosts Previous studies with hopTum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors), Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17- or Lh14-infected hopTum-l hosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hopTum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection (Drs, Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] for Lh14; Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hopTum-l larvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1 hopTum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 ± 0.72 versus 4.10 ± 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 ± 0.04 versus 1.13 ± 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14). The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps. Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46 Hemocytes in the hopTum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43 Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (Figures S5A–S5H). In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hopTum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation (Figures S5I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0 hopTum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes (Figures S5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain. G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1 hopTum-l lymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample, Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland.20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh-infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (Figures S7A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (Figures S7G–S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system. Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C; Tables S2 and S3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17; this number was 16 for Lh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Differential expression of EV genes (A and B) Enhanced volcano plots for DEGs in Lb17 (A) and Lh14 (B) S0 vs. G0 wasp samples. Numerical identifiers correspond to EV genes in Tables 1 and 2, with their corresponding accession numbers. (C) Number of transcripts from adult male and female wasps, showing fluctuation in space. The term “all transcripts” refers to the number of transcript sequences in the Lb17 (GAJA00000000) and Lh14 (GAJC00000000) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA-Seq reads.47 The term “all DE transcripts” refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples (Tables S2 and S3). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. See STAR methods and Figure S8 for more details. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312 Lb17 EV and 398 Lh14 EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29 Lb17 and 5 Lh14 transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown in Tables 1 and 2. See also Figures S8, S10, and S11.The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published.14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV proteins show an overall profile similar to the Lh EV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55).

Spaceflight does not significantly affect wasp emergence Spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this conclusion. EV morphology and Lh14 virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hopTum-l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50% ± 0.76% G0; 6.12% ± 0.71% S0; 2.99% ± 0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0 Lh14 venom activity (Figures S11A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma success (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps. Mutant Lh14 strains Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported.51,52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males (Figure 9A). While no heritable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14, we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 (Figures 9B–9G). In the aurum1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F; side-by-side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure-breeding aurum1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9D–9F). In rare cases, this kona1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected (Figure 9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Mutant strains of L heterotoma (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum1 (pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), and kona1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus aurum1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona1 mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. (I) Homozygous kona1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses). (J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygous kona1 females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See also Figure S12.To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9H). Even though the kona1 strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infecting kona1/kona1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona1 females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors of kona1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection of kona1/kona1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.",
    "discussion": "Discussion American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53 H. juglandis is a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis.53,54 D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56 Drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hopTum-l flies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewer y w flies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild-type flies.55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.57,58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies. Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w, but not in hopTum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0 hopTum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w flies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict. Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hopTum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants are also upregulated in S0 y w flies, even though the S0 y w flies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs, Drsl, CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0 hopTum-l flies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w column in Figure 5D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1 hopTum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hopTum-l larvae did not persist in S1 hopTum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state of hopTum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight. Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14.8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard. The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14, and (c) stronger transcriptional activation of Drosomycin (Drs) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host. Mutant wasps Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere.59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation,60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1 Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization.1,61 Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence. Limitations of the study Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.",

Copyright notice ID: 10797188 PMID: 38261932 Summary While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth. Subject areas: Parasitology, Biological sciences, EntomologyGraphical abstract Open in a new tabHighlights •Spaceflight enhances immune gene expression and tumor development in fruit flies •Drosophila parasitoid wasps can develop in space without losing virulence •Parasitoid mutants with visible alterations were obtained Parasitology; Biological sciences; EntomologyIntroduction As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3 These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight on D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission. Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5 The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6 This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7 Encapsulation of the parasite egg by Drosophila larvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful. Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8 Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10 Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12 L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh.8,13 Lb EVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to Lh EVs.13,14,15,16 There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.12 While the venom EVs from both Lb and Lh are immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly. Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17 Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19 Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20 Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21 In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains: one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22,23,24 Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23,24,25,26 In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue.27,28 Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin administration.24 Thus, the hopTum-l background is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22,23,24 In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30 The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of space L. heterotoma. Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32 Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.Results Spaceflight compromises y w but not hopTum-l emergence Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Figure 1A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host-parasite scuffle, naive hosts or Lb17-/Lh14-infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions (Figures 1B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures (fly strains y w and y w, hopTum-l) and four fly/parasite co-cultures on each host strain (Figure 1D). Survival of animals was scored post-flight (see STAR Methods). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The FFL-03 experimental design (A) D. melanogaster adults (top left) and larva (bottom left) imaged together with parasitoid wasps (bottom right). Female wasps have shorter antennae than males (right). (B) Vented fly box (VFB) with 15 holding slots for fly vials. (C) Six VFBs in one cargo transfer bag (CTB). Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew. The ISS flight conditions were mirrored at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory, where ground control samples were housed for the duration of the mission. (D) The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures and four fly/wasp co-cultures, as shown. See STAR methods for more details.We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared flies (Figures 2A–2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co-culture vials (Figures 2D and 2E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Survival of flies and wasps in ground control (G0) and space (S0) samples (A–C) The average numbers of adult male (A), adult female (B), and all adult (C) flies per vial in naive y w and hopTum-l cultures. The number of animals, averaged from 14 vials, is shown below. Error bars show standard error. y w males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 86 ± 3 and 39 ± 5; p ≤ 2.23 × 10−8. hopTum-l males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 44 ± 5 and 57 ± 3; p = 0.03. y w females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 105 ± 4 and 63 ± 4; p = 1.03 × 10−8. hopTum-l females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 53 ± 7 and 51 ± 3; p = 0.74. Total y w adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 260 ± 8 and 151 ± 10; p = 5.38 × 10−10. Total hopTum-l adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 122 ± 15 and 129 ± 6; p = 0.38.

See also Figure S9.Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1). Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0 hopTum-l compared to y w flies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w and hopTum-l flies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1F.Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories (Figures 3A–3F). In the first category (Figures 3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases (Figure 3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure 3B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures 3A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns in hopTum-l and y w flies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0 hopTum-l vs. G0 y w. Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes34,35 (TotM and Tep1 family members, SPH93, and CG18563). Lectin-24A is predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3.36 Notable DEGs in panel (B) with disease-relevant human orthologs are CG32379, CG32318, and CG30059.37 (C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) genes in S0 y w versus G0 y w. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in these profiles. The fly histone H1s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia38) and CG6431, a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes), are downregulated (D). (E) Genes in hopTum-l whose expression is activated in space. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in this profile. CG3108 is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5.37 (F) Genes in y w and hopTum-l whose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle-related and flight-related genes are included. Flight-related genes are CG34327 (associated with abnormal flight), flightin (fln), and Troponin C isoform 4 (TpnC4). See also Figure S1.In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures 3C–3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response-related proteins (Figure 3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w flies but not in S0 hopTum-l flies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family (yellow-g, yellow-g2, yellow-e3), bearded gene family (Brd, Tom, BobA), Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb, Cp7Fc, Cp16, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38, Mur11Da; Figure 3D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary.39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight-related genes (e.g., flightin [fln] and Troponin C isoform 4 [TpnC4]; Figure 3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle40 are sensitive to spaceflight.Essential genes are downregulated in y w flies exposed to spaceflight To further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated, Figure 4A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41 The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See also Figure S1.The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y w space-flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617, with log2-(FC) < −1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l flies.Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0 y w flies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hopTum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes),42 both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hopTum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C).Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hopTum-l transcriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w flies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B). Since the hopTum-l mutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected in hopTum-l flies relative to y w flies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E, TotA, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, and CG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA, diedel, et, and CG4793 in hopTum-l versus y w were maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37 as follows: upd2 and upd3 are ligands; CycD, CycE, and Cdk2 are positive regulators; diedel, Socs36E, and et are negative regulators. The target genes are TotA, Idgf1, pirk, mfas, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, CG10764, CG15211, and Gf. (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See also Figures S1 and S2.Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hopTum-l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2 and upd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA, Gf, mfas, and CG15211) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046, Toll-9, Figure 5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA, SB1, SD, Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2, 3, 5) were also activated in S0 hopTum-l versus G0 hopTum-l flies (Figure 5D). To examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0 hopTum-l adults (Figure 6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6B and 6C). In 25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 ± 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 ± 0.40 in S0 flies (Figure 6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure 6E). Tumors were not detected in S0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Tumor burden in naive G0/S0 hopTum-l fly adults (A) Experimental design for space and ground hopTum-l flies for post-flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (see STAR methods) at 22°C, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. (B and C) Representative G1 hopTum-l adult female (B) and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large. (D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’s t test; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1 hopTum-l adult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’s t test). See also Figures S1 and S2.High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae As in the mutant hopTum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively (Figures S3A–S3E). Thus, in hopTum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling. We assessed if naive S1 y w or hopTum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight-responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764, LUBEL, PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b, and AMP genes, CecB, AttC, Drs, and Drsl5 (Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hopTum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA, DptB, CecA2, Drsl3, Drsl5, and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts (Figure S3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74 ± 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 ± 0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Cellular immunity in G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae, post parasitization (A) Tumor (T) scores of uninfected (UI) and tumor and encapsulation (T + E) scores of G0/S0 Lb- or G0/S0 Lh-infected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae. Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. (B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T + E scores (see STAR methods). Lb17 wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. p values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See also Figures S3–S7.Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hopTum-l hosts Previous studies with hopTum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors), Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17- or Lh14-infected hopTum-l hosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hopTum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection (Drs, Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] for Lh14; Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hopTum-l larvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1 hopTum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 ± 0.72 versus 4.10 ± 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 ± 0.04 versus 1.13 ± 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14). The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps.Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46 Hemocytes in the hopTum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43 Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (Figures S5A–S5H). In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hopTum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation (Figures S5I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0 hopTum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes (Figures S5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain. G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1 hopTum-l lymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample, Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland.20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh-infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (Figures S7A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (Figures S7G–S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system.Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C; Tables S2 and S3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17; this number was 16 for Lh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Figure 8.

The term “all transcripts” refers to the number of transcript sequences in the Lb17 (GAJA00000000) and Lh14 (GAJC00000000) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA-Seq reads.47 The term “all DE transcripts” refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples (Tables S2 and S3). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. See STAR methods and Figure S8 for more details. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312 Lb17 EV and 398 Lh14 EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29 Lb17 and 5 Lh14 transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown in Tables 1 and 2. See also Figures S8, S10, and S11.The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published.14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV proteins show an overall profile similar to the Lh EV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated (Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain. Table 1.

The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this conclusion.EV morphology and Lh14 virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hopTum-l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50% ± 0.76% G0; 6.12% ± 0.71% S0; 2.99% ± 0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0 Lh14 venom activity (Figures S11A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma success (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps.Mutant Lh14 strains Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported.51,52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males (Figure 9A). While no heritable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14, we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 (Figures 9B–9G). In the aurum1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F; side-by-side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure-breeding aurum1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9D–9F). In rare cases, this kona1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected (Figure 9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Mutant strains of L heterotoma (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum1 (pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), and kona1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus aurum1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona1 mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. (I) Homozygous kona1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses). (J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygous kona1 females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See also Figure S12.To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9H). Even though the kona1 strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infecting kona1/kona1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona1 females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors of kona1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection of kona1/kona1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.Discussion American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53 H. juglandis is a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis.53,54 D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56 Drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hopTum-l flies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewer y w flies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild-type flies.55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.57,58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies. Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w, but not in hopTum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0 hopTum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w flies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict.Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hopTum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants are also upregulated in S0 y w flies, even though the S0 y w flies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs, Drsl, CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0 hopTum-l flies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w column in Figure 5D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1 hopTum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hopTum-l larvae did not persist in S1 hopTum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state of hopTum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight.Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14.8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard. The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14, and (c) stronger transcriptional activation of Drosomycin (Drs) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host.Mutant wasps Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere.59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation,60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1 Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization.1,61 Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence.Limitations of the study Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.STAR★Methods Key resources table REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody Millipore Sigma Catalog # 06-570 mouse anti-p40 antibody Chiu et al., 20069 PMID: 16432035 Chemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteins 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indoyl phosphate (BCIP) Promega Catalog #S381C nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) Promega Catalog #S380C paraformaldehyde (crystalline) Sigma Catalog #P6148 rhodamine-labeled phalloidin Life Technologies Catalog #R415 vectashield mounting medium Vector Labs Catalog #H100 Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate Invitrogen Catalog # H-1398 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 16539-06 2% osmium tetroxide Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 19150 Biological samples G0 and S0 adult y w and hopTum-l flies (genotypes below) This study N/A G0 and S0 y w and hopTum-l larvae This study N/A G1 and S1 y w and hopTum-l larvae This study N/A G0 and S0 Leptopilina boulardi 17 adult wasps This study N/A G0 and S0 Leptopilina heterotoma 14 adult wasps This study N/A Critical commercial assays RNA extraction RNA/Protein Purification plus kit Norgen Catalog # 48200 Non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for RNA-Seq sequencing libraries New England Biolabs Catalog #E7775 Deposited data Drosophila RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-583; OSDR ID: OSD-588; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-588;https://doi.org/10.26030/v9rh-5a70 Leptopilina boulardi RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-587; OSDR ID: OSD-610; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-610;https://doi.org/10.26030/9ee4-6s36 Leptopilina heterotoma RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-586; OSDR ID: OSD-609; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-609;https://doi.org/10.26030/5rjq-a347 Experimental models: Organisms/strains y1 w1 Bloomington Stock Center BDSC:1495 y w hopTum-lmsn-Gal4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-lmsn > GFP Panettieri et al., 201929 PMID: 31562189 L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) Schlenke et al., 20078 PMID: 34051038 L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14) Schlenke et al., 20078 PMID: 34051038 Wing color mutant: L. heterotoma14 aurum1 This study Lh14 aurum1 Wing shape and ovipositor mutant:L. heterotoma14 kona1 This study Lh14 kona1 Software and algorithms Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud v20-v24 Adobe https://www.adobe.com/ Pipeline for Drosophila RNA-Seq data NASA GeneLab: Open Science for Life in Space GL-DPPD-7101-D; https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md Slurm and R scripts to process and analyze Leptopilina boulardi RNA-Seq data and Leptopilina heterotoma RNA-Seq data This study, supplement Data S1 Other 25 mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size) Whatman Catalog # 110605 SEM specimen mount stubs Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 75110 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Genewiz) Illumina, San Diego https://www.Illumina.com Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (GeneLab) Illumina, San Diego https://www.Illumina.com Open in a new tabResource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Shubha Govind (sgovind@ccny.cuny.edu).Materials availability This study generated two mutant strains of Leptopilina heterotoma.

Experimental model and study participant details Experimental design and sample preparation D. melanogaster strains y1 w1 and y w hopTum-l msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-l msn > GFP),24 and wasp species L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) and L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14),8 were included in the ground control and flight experiments. The hopTum-l strain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog, hopscotch.22 This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, the misshapen (msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62 Expression of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors. Extensive pre-flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day flight period. Six conditions (two fly-only cultures, four fly/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The fly-only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12 mL ± 1 mL fly food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL ± 1 mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum. Prior to launch, y w fly-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. The hopTum-l cultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For the y w co-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg-laying. For hopTum-l egg-lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch.Mission and hardware details Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63 Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule. A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York.Condition of insect cultures Visual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the fly food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 fly-only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufficient early instar larvae to set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures developed under corresponding conditions, while adult fly samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials.Method details Survival studies Animals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For fly-only cultures, statistical analysis was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co-cultures, statistical analysis was performed on the number of flies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete. The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.Dissections, staining, and imaging Depending on sample availability, 5–15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, staining, and imaging were previously published.64,65,66,67 Lymph glands were counter-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). For Lh-infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti-p40 antibody9,20 (1:1000) was used. Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging software in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected using the Magnafire-SP software.Mitotic index Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l adult flies (described above) were set up at 25°C. Three to five wandering third-instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 μg/mL BCIP and 250 μg/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.Adult tumorigenesis Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0 hopTum-l adults (20 males and 5–10 females, ∼22°C) were scored 6.5 days (25°C) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0 hopTum-l flies was reared at 27°C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-lay.24 Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student’s t test was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other.Infection and larval host immunity assay Egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l flies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25°C for 3 days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times. Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions. hopTum-l tumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight’s effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small- and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae. Uninfected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.Bulk RNA-Seq sample preparation methods For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer. For adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0 y w; (b) S0 y w; (c) G0 hopTum-l; (d) S0 hopTum-l were used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0 Lb17 and Lh14 wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1 y w animals. In addition, RNA was also extracted from hopTum-l larvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (d) S0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i) G0 Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0 Lh-infected S1 hosts. The RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2 × 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was ∼300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane. The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at −80°C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).Processing of Drosophila RNA-Seq data The reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. D. melanogaster STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A majority (90.08%–94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the fly reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69 median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Analysis of Drosophila RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples DEGs in adult fly samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.070 and the Drosophila database (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13). EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular function.71 Results were visualized by R package.72Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding ∼280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these ∼280 genes were examined in FlyBase37 and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from ∼3- to 12-fold. For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76 Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41 which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78 For larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA-Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA-Seq results above.Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. L. heterotoma Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and the Lh14 GAJC contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz). L. boulardi Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, with Lb17 GAJA contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz). Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) for Lb17 and Lh14 were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressed Lb17 and Lh14 DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20 - 59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (Tables S2 and S3).Analysis of parasite RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.Identification and analysis of parasite EV transcripts Proteins from purified Lb17 EV have not been characterized, but the composition of purified EVs from the Lb Gotheron (LbG) strain is published.14 To identify differentially expressed Lb17 EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383 LbG EV proteins, we queried the LbG EV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressed Lb17 transcripts in space (Table S2; LbG EV query sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, ’s tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62; gap costs existence extension 1, filtered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E-value ≤1 e−30, query coverage ≥50%, and percent identity of ≥50% were scored as high confidence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table 1), either due to their high log (2)-FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E = 3.00 e−100, query coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E = 4.00 e−30, query coverage 57%, and % identity 32.69). An estimate of the overall Lb17 EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383 LbG sequences were used to tblastn-search the GAJA00000000 sequences.47 This search identified 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E ≤ 1 e−50, query coverage ≥70%, percent identity ≥70%;  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81 Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of the LbG EV proteins are expressed in the Lb17 female abdomen. Since the Lh14 EV proteome is already characterized,11,12 tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310 Lh14 DEGs (Table 2).SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60°C oven for 2 h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.Virulence assay for Lh14 venom Forty hopTum-l larvae were bled in 200 μL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 μL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0 Lh14 wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 μg of venom protein was added to the slide chamber with hopTum-l hemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4 h at 25°C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’s t test statistic was applied to determine the significance.Isolation and characterization of L. heterotoma mutants G0/S0 Lb17 and Lh14 male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0 Lb17 or G0 Lh14 screens. One Lh14 grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. This aurum1 male was mated with “lab” females; the progeny was “selfed” to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. The aurum1 strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock was established. A second mutant phenotype was observed in the aurum1 wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of this aurum1 wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant, kona1, assorted from the aurum1 mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygous kona1 females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11 kona1 male-mated, heterozygous or homozygous kona1 females, were introduced to y w hosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs. To examine if aurum1 and kona1 mutations assort independently, unmated homozygous aurum1 females were mated with kona1 males. Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds of y w infections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored. Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous kona1 females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygous kona1 females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope.Quantification and statistical analysis Sample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corresponding figure legend. For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (± standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean ± standard error was calculated, and a Student’s t test was used to determine biological significance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Acknowledgments We are grateful to Edina Blazevic, Jackson Chen, Amy Gresser, Ye He, Waleed Khalid, Kevin Martin, Leo Mazur, Jorge Morales, and Zubaidul Razzak for assistance with experiments or analysis.

    "abstract": "Summary While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth. Subject areas: Parasitology, Biological sciences, Entomology",
    "introduction": "Introduction As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3 These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight on D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission. Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5 The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6 This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7 Encapsulation of the parasite egg by Drosophila larvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful. Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8 Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10 Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12 L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh.8,13 Lb EVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to Lh EVs.13,14,15,16 There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.12 While the venom EVs from both Lb and Lh are immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly. Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17 Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19 Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20 Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21 In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains: one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22,23,24 Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23,24,25,26 In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue.27,28 Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin administration.24 Thus, the hopTum-l background is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22,23,24 In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30 The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of space L. heterotoma. Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32 Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",

Experimental model and study participant details Experimental design and sample preparation D. melanogaster strains y1 w1 and y w hopTum-l msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-l msn > GFP),24 and wasp species L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) and L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14),8 were included in the ground control and flight experiments. The hopTum-l strain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog, hopscotch.22 This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, the misshapen (msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62 Expression of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors. Extensive pre-flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day flight period. Six conditions (two fly-only cultures, four fly/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The fly-only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12 mL ± 1 mL fly food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL ± 1 mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum. Prior to launch, y w fly-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. The hopTum-l cultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For the y w co-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg-laying. For hopTum-l egg-lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch.Mission and hardware details Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63 Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule. A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York.Condition of insect cultures Visual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the fly food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 fly-only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufficient early instar larvae to set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures developed under corresponding conditions, while adult fly samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials. Method details Survival studies Animals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For fly-only cultures, statistical analysis was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co-cultures, statistical analysis was performed on the number of flies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete. The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.Dissections, staining, and imaging Depending on sample availability, 5–15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, staining, and imaging were previously published.64,65,66,67 Lymph glands were counter-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). For Lh-infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti-p40 antibody9,20 (1:1000) was used. Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging software in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected using the Magnafire-SP software.Mitotic index Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l adult flies (described above) were set up at 25°C. Three to five wandering third-instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 μg/mL BCIP and 250 μg/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.Adult tumorigenesis Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0 hopTum-l adults (20 males and 5–10 females, ∼22°C) were scored 6.5 days (25°C) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0 hopTum-l flies was reared at 27°C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-lay.24 Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student’s t test was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other.Infection and larval host immunity assay Egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l flies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25°C for 3 days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times. Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions. hopTum-l tumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight’s effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small- and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae. Uninfected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.Bulk RNA-Seq sample preparation methods For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer. For adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0 y w; (b) S0 y w; (c) G0 hopTum-l; (d) S0 hopTum-l were used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0 Lb17 and Lh14 wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1 y w animals. In addition, RNA was also extracted from hopTum-l larvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (d) S0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i) G0 Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0 Lh-infected S1 hosts. The RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2 × 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was ∼300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane. The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at −80°C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).Processing of Drosophila RNA-Seq data The reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. D. melanogaster STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A majority (90.08%–94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the fly reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69 median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Analysis of Drosophila RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples DEGs in adult fly samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.070 and the Drosophila database (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13). EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular function.71 Results were visualized by R package.72Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding ∼280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these ∼280 genes were examined in FlyBase37 and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from ∼3- to 12-fold. For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76 Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41 which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78 For larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA-Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA-Seq results above.Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. L. heterotoma Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and the Lh14 GAJC contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz). L. boulardi Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, with Lb17 GAJA contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz). Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) for Lb17 and Lh14 were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressed Lb17 and Lh14 DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20 - 59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (Tables S2 and S3).Analysis of parasite RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.Identification and analysis of parasite EV transcripts Proteins from purified Lb17 EV have not been characterized, but the composition of purified EVs from the Lb Gotheron (LbG) strain is published.14 To identify differentially expressed Lb17 EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383 LbG EV proteins, we queried the LbG EV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressed Lb17 transcripts in space (Table S2; LbG EV query sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, ’s tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62; gap costs existence extension 1, filtered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E-value ≤1 e−30, query coverage ≥50%, and percent identity of ≥50% were scored as high confidence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table 1), either due to their high log (2)-FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E = 3.00 e−100, query coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E = 4.00 e−30, query coverage 57%, and % identity 32.69). An estimate of the overall Lb17 EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383 LbG sequences were used to tblastn-search the GAJA00000000 sequences.47 This search identified 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E ≤ 1 e−50, query coverage ≥70%, percent identity ≥70%;  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81 Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of the LbG EV proteins are expressed in the Lb17 female abdomen. Since the Lh14 EV proteome is already characterized,11,12 tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310 Lh14 DEGs (Table 2).SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60°C oven for 2 h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.Virulence assay for Lh14 venom Forty hopTum-l larvae were bled in 200 μL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 μL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0 Lh14 wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 μg of venom protein was added to the slide chamber with hopTum-l hemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4 h at 25°C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’s t test statistic was applied to determine the significance.Isolation and characterization of L. heterotoma mutants G0/S0 Lb17 and Lh14 male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0 Lb17 or G0 Lh14 screens. One Lh14 grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. This aurum1 male was mated with “lab” females; the progeny was “selfed” to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. The aurum1 strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock was established. A second mutant phenotype was observed in the aurum1 wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of this aurum1 wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant, kona1, assorted from the aurum1 mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygous kona1 females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11 kona1 male-mated, heterozygous or homozygous kona1 females, were introduced to y w hosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs. To examine if aurum1 and kona1 mutations assort independently, unmated homozygous aurum1 females were mated with kona1 males. Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds of y w infections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored. Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous kona1 females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygous kona1 females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope. Quantification and statistical analysis Sample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corresponding figure legend. For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (± standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean ± standard error was calculated, and a Student’s t test was used to determine biological significance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight compromises y w but not hopTum-l emergence Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Figure 1A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host-parasite scuffle, naive hosts or Lb17-/Lh14-infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions (Figures 1B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures (fly strains y w and y w, hopTum-l) and four fly/parasite co-cultures on each host strain (Figure 1D). Survival of animals was scored post-flight (see STAR Methods). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The FFL-03 experimental design (A) D. melanogaster adults (top left) and larva (bottom left) imaged together with parasitoid wasps (bottom right). Female wasps have shorter antennae than males (right). (B) Vented fly box (VFB) with 15 holding slots for fly vials. (C) Six VFBs in one cargo transfer bag (CTB). Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew. The ISS flight conditions were mirrored at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory, where ground control samples were housed for the duration of the mission. (D) The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures and four fly/wasp co-cultures, as shown. See STAR methods for more details.We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared flies (Figures 2A–2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co-culture vials (Figures 2D and 2E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Survival of flies and wasps in ground control (G0) and space (S0) samples (A–C) The average numbers of adult male (A), adult female (B), and all adult (C) flies per vial in naive y w and hopTum-l cultures. The number of animals, averaged from 14 vials, is shown below. Error bars show standard error. y w males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 86 ± 3 and 39 ± 5; p ≤ 2.23 × 10−8. hopTum-l males per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 44 ± 5 and 57 ± 3; p = 0.03. y w females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 105 ± 4 and 63 ± 4; p = 1.03 × 10−8. hopTum-l females per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 53 ± 7 and 51 ± 3; p = 0.74. Total y w adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 260 ± 8 and 151 ± 10; p = 5.38 × 10−10. Total hopTum-l adults per vial in G0 and S0 samples = 122 ± 15 and 129 ± 6; p = 0.38. (D and E) The number of G0 adult flies (D) and wasps (E) per vial in fly-wasp co-cultures. Error bars show standard error.

G0 Lb on y w hosts = 38 ± 5; S0 Lb on y w hosts = 41 ± 5; p = 0.31. G0 Lb on hopTum-l hosts = 14 ± 4; S0 Lb on hopTum-l hosts = 15 ± 3; p = 0.78. G0 Lh on y w hosts = 75 ± 7; S0 Lh on y w hosts = 84 ± 9; p = 0.48. G0 Lh on hopTum-l hosts = 10 ± 2; S0 Lh on hopTum-l hosts = 14 ± 3; p = 0.26. See also Figure S9. Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1). Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0 hopTum-l compared to y w flies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w and hopTum-l flies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1F. Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories (Figures 3A–3F). In the first category (Figures 3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases (Figure 3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure 3B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures 3A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns in hopTum-l and y w flies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0 hopTum-l vs. G0 y w. Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes34,35 (TotM and Tep1 family members, SPH93, and CG18563). Lectin-24A is predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3.36 Notable DEGs in panel (B) with disease-relevant human orthologs are CG32379, CG32318, and CG30059.37 (C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) genes in S0 y w versus G0 y w. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in these profiles. The fly histone H1s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia38) and CG6431, a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes), are downregulated (D). (E) Genes in hopTum-l whose expression is activated in space. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in this profile. CG3108 is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5.37 (F) Genes in y w and hopTum-l whose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle-related and flight-related genes are included. Flight-related genes are CG34327 (associated with abnormal flight), flightin (fln), and Troponin C isoform 4 (TpnC4). See also Figure S1.In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures 3C–3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response-related proteins (Figure 3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w flies but not in S0 hopTum-l flies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family (yellow-g, yellow-g2, yellow-e3), bearded gene family (Brd, Tom, BobA), Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb, Cp7Fc, Cp16, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38, Mur11Da; Figure 3D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary.39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight-related genes (e.g., flightin [fln] and Troponin C isoform 4 [TpnC4]; Figure 3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle40 are sensitive to spaceflight. Essential genes are downregulated in y w flies exposed to spaceflight To further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated, Figure 4A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41 The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See also Figure S1.The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y w space-flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617, with log2-(FC) < −1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l flies. Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0 y w flies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hopTum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes),42 both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hopTum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C). Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hopTum-l transcriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w flies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B). Since the hopTum-l mutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected in hopTum-l flies relative to y w flies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E, TotA, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, and CG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA, diedel, et, and CG4793 in hopTum-l versus y w were maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37 as follows: upd2 and upd3 are ligands; CycD, CycE, and Cdk2 are positive regulators; diedel, Socs36E, and et are negative regulators. The target genes are TotA, Idgf1, pirk, mfas, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, CG10764, CG15211, and Gf. (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See also Figures S1 and S2.Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hopTum-l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2 and upd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA, Gf, mfas, and CG15211) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046, Toll-9, Figure 5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA, SB1, SD, Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2, 3, 5) were also activated in S0 hopTum-l versus G0 hopTum-l flies (Figure 5D). To examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0 hopTum-l adults (Figure 6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6B and 6C). In 25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 ± 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 ± 0.40 in S0 flies (Figure 6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure 6E). Tumors were not detected in S0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Tumor burden in naive G0/S0 hopTum-l fly adults (A) Experimental design for space and ground hopTum-l flies for post-flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (see STAR methods) at 22°C, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. (B and C) Representative G1 hopTum-l adult female (B) and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large. (D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’s t test; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1 hopTum-l adult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’s t test). See also Figures S1 and S2. High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae As in the mutant hopTum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively (Figures S3A–S3E). Thus, in hopTum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling. We assessed if naive S1 y w or hopTum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight-responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764, LUBEL, PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b, and AMP genes, CecB, AttC, Drs, and Drsl5 (Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hopTum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA, DptB, CecA2, Drsl3, Drsl5, and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts (Figure S3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74 ± 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 ± 0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53).

Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. (B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T + E scores (see STAR methods). Lb17 wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. p values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See also Figures S3–S7. Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hopTum-l hosts Previous studies with hopTum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors), Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17- or Lh14-infected hopTum-l hosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hopTum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection (Drs, Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] for Lh14; Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hopTum-l larvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1 hopTum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 ± 0.72 versus 4.10 ± 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 ± 0.04 versus 1.13 ± 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14). The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps. Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46 Hemocytes in the hopTum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43 Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (Figures S5A–S5H). In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hopTum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation (Figures S5I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0 hopTum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes (Figures S5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain. G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1 hopTum-l lymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample, Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland.20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh-infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (Figures S7A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (Figures S7G–S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system. Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C; Tables S2 and S3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17; this number was 16 for Lh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Figure 8.

Numerical identifiers correspond to EV genes in Tables 1 and 2, with their corresponding accession numbers. (C) Number of transcripts from adult male and female wasps, showing fluctuation in space. The term “all transcripts” refers to the number of transcript sequences in the Lb17 (GAJA00000000) and Lh14 (GAJC00000000) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA-Seq reads.47 The term “all DE transcripts” refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples (Tables S2 and S3). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. See STAR methods and Figure S8 for more details. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312 Lb17 EV and 398 Lh14 EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29 Lb17 and 5 Lh14 transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown in Tables 1 and 2. See also Figures S8, S10, and S11.The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published.14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV proteins show an overall profile similar to the Lh EV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated (Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain. Table 1.

Spaceflight does not significantly affect wasp emergence Spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this conclusion. EV morphology and Lh14 virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hopTum-l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50% ± 0.76% G0; 6.12% ± 0.71% S0; 2.99% ± 0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0 Lh14 venom activity (Figures S11A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma success (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps. Mutant Lh14 strains Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported.51,52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males (Figure 9A). While no heritable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14, we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 (Figures 9B–9G). In the aurum1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F; side-by-side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure-breeding aurum1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9D–9F). In rare cases, this kona1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected (Figure 9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Mutant strains of L heterotoma (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum1 (pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), and kona1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus aurum1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona1 mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. (I) Homozygous kona1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses). (J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygous kona1 females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See also Figure S12.To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9H). Even though the kona1 strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infecting kona1/kona1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona1 females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors of kona1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection of kona1/kona1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.",
    "discussion": "Discussion American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53 H. juglandis is a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis.53,54 D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56 Drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hopTum-l flies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewer y w flies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild-type flies.55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.57,58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies. Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w, but not in hopTum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0 hopTum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w flies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict. Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hopTum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants are also upregulated in S0 y w flies, even though the S0 y w flies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs, Drsl, CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0 hopTum-l flies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w column in Figure 5D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1 hopTum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hopTum-l larvae did not persist in S1 hopTum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state of hopTum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight. Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14.8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard. The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14, and (c) stronger transcriptional activation of Drosomycin (Drs) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host. Mutant wasps Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere.59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation,60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1 Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization.1,61 Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence. Limitations of the study Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.",

Copyright notice ID: 10797188 PMID: 38261932 Summary While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth.

Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3 These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight on D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission. Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5 The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6 This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7 Encapsulation of the parasite egg by Drosophila larvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful. Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8 Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10 Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12 L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh.8,13 Lb EVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to Lh EVs.13,14,15,16 There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.12 While the venom EVs from both Lb and Lh are immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly. Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17 Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19 Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20 Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21 In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains: one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22,23,24 Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23,24,25,26 In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue.27,28 Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin administration.24 Thus, the hopTum-l background is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22,23,24 In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30 The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of space L. heterotoma. Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32 Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.Results Spaceflight compromises y w but not hopTum-l emergence Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Figure 1A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host-parasite scuffle, naive hosts or Lb17-/Lh14-infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions (Figures 1B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures (fly strains y w and y w, hopTum-l) and four fly/parasite co-cultures on each host strain (Figure 1D). Survival of animals was scored post-flight (see STAR Methods). Figure 1.

Female wasps have shorter antennae than males (right). (B) Vented fly box (VFB) with 15 holding slots for fly vials. (C) Six VFBs in one cargo transfer bag (CTB). Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew. The ISS flight conditions were mirrored at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory, where ground control samples were housed for the duration of the mission. (D) The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures and four fly/wasp co-cultures, as shown. See STAR methods for more details.We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared flies (Figures 2A–2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co-culture vials (Figures 2D and 2E). Figure 2.

See also Figure S9.Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1). Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0 hopTum-l compared to y w flies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w and hopTum-l flies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1F.Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories (Figures 3A–3F). In the first category (Figures 3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases (Figure 3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure 3B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures 3A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns in hopTum-l and y w flies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0 hopTum-l vs. G0 y w. Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes34,35 (TotM and Tep1 family members, SPH93, and CG18563). Lectin-24A is predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3.36 Notable DEGs in panel (B) with disease-relevant human orthologs are CG32379, CG32318, and CG30059.37 (C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) genes in S0 y w versus G0 y w. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in these profiles. The fly histone H1s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia38) and CG6431, a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes), are downregulated (D). (E) Genes in hopTum-l whose expression is activated in space. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in this profile. CG3108 is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5.37 (F) Genes in y w and hopTum-l whose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle-related and flight-related genes are included. Flight-related genes are CG34327 (associated with abnormal flight), flightin (fln), and Troponin C isoform 4 (TpnC4). See also Figure S1.In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures 3C–3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response-related proteins (Figure 3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w flies but not in S0 hopTum-l flies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family (yellow-g, yellow-g2, yellow-e3), bearded gene family (Brd, Tom, BobA), Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb, Cp7Fc, Cp16, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38, Mur11Da; Figure 3D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary.39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight-related genes (e.g., flightin [fln] and Troponin C isoform 4 [TpnC4]; Figure 3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle40 are sensitive to spaceflight.Essential genes are downregulated in y w flies exposed to spaceflight To further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated, Figure 4A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41 The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See also Figure S1.The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y w space-flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617, with log2-(FC) < −1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l flies.Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0 y w flies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hopTum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes),42 both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hopTum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C).Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hopTum-l transcriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w flies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B). Since the hopTum-l mutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected in hopTum-l flies relative to y w flies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E, TotA, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, and CG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA, diedel, et, and CG4793 in hopTum-l versus y w were maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37 as follows: upd2 and upd3 are ligands; CycD, CycE, and Cdk2 are positive regulators; diedel, Socs36E, and et are negative regulators. The target genes are TotA, Idgf1, pirk, mfas, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, CG10764, CG15211, and Gf. (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See also Figures S1 and S2.Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hopTum-l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2 and upd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA, Gf, mfas, and CG15211) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046, Toll-9, Figure 5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA, SB1, SD, Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2, 3, 5) were also activated in S0 hopTum-l versus G0 hopTum-l flies (Figure 5D). To examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0 hopTum-l adults (Figure 6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6B and 6C). In 25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 ± 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 ± 0.40 in S0 flies (Figure 6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure 6E). Tumors were not detected in S0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Tumor burden in naive G0/S0 hopTum-l fly adults (A) Experimental design for space and ground hopTum-l flies for post-flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (see STAR methods) at 22°C, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. (B and C) Representative G1 hopTum-l adult female (B) and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large. (D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’s t test; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1 hopTum-l adult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’s t test). See also Figures S1 and S2.High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae As in the mutant hopTum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively (Figures S3A–S3E). Thus, in hopTum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling. We assessed if naive S1 y w or hopTum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight-responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764, LUBEL, PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b, and AMP genes, CecB, AttC, Drs, and Drsl5 (Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hopTum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA, DptB, CecA2, Drsl3, Drsl5, and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts (Figure S3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74 ± 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 ± 0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53). Figure 7.

Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. (B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T + E scores (see STAR methods). Lb17 wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. p values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See also Figures S3–S7.Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hopTum-l hosts Previous studies with hopTum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors), Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17- or Lh14-infected hopTum-l hosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hopTum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection (Drs, Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] for Lh14; Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hopTum-l larvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1 hopTum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 ± 0.72 versus 4.10 ± 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 ± 0.04 versus 1.13 ± 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14). The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps.Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46 Hemocytes in the hopTum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43 Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (Figures S5A–S5H). In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hopTum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation (Figures S5I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0 hopTum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes (Figures S5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain. G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1 hopTum-l lymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample, Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland.20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh-infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (Figures S7A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (Figures S7G–S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system.Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C; Tables S2 and S3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17; this number was 16 for Lh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Figure 8.

The term “all transcripts” refers to the number of transcript sequences in the Lb17 (GAJA00000000) and Lh14 (GAJC00000000) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA-Seq reads.47 The term “all DE transcripts” refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples (Tables S2 and S3). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. See STAR methods and Figure S8 for more details. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312 Lb17 EV and 398 Lh14 EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29 Lb17 and 5 Lh14 transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown in Tables 1 and 2. See also Figures S8, S10, and S11.The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published.14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV proteins show an overall profile similar to the Lh EV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated (Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain. Table 1.

The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this conclusion.EV morphology and Lh14 virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hopTum-l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50% ± 0.76% G0; 6.12% ± 0.71% S0; 2.99% ± 0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0 Lh14 venom activity (Figures S11A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma success (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps.Mutant Lh14 strains Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported.51,52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males (Figure 9A). While no heritable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14, we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 (Figures 9B–9G). In the aurum1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F; side-by-side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure-breeding aurum1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9D–9F). In rare cases, this kona1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected (Figure 9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Mutant strains of L heterotoma (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum1 (pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), and kona1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus aurum1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona1 mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. (I) Homozygous kona1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses). (J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygous kona1 females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See also Figure S12.To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9H). Even though the kona1 strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infecting kona1/kona1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona1 females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors of kona1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection of kona1/kona1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.Discussion American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53 H. juglandis is a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis.53,54 D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56 Drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hopTum-l flies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewer y w flies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild-type flies.55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.57,58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies. Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w, but not in hopTum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0 hopTum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w flies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict.Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hopTum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants are also upregulated in S0 y w flies, even though the S0 y w flies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs, Drsl, CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0 hopTum-l flies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w column in Figure 5D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1 hopTum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hopTum-l larvae did not persist in S1 hopTum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state of hopTum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight.Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14.8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard. The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14, and (c) stronger transcriptional activation of Drosomycin (Drs) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host.Mutant wasps Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere.59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation,60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1 Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization.1,61 Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence.Limitations of the study Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.STAR★Methods Key resources table REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody Millipore Sigma Catalog # 06-570 mouse anti-p40 antibody Chiu et al., 20069 PMID: 16432035 Chemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteins 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indoyl phosphate (BCIP) Promega Catalog #S381C nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) Promega Catalog #S380C paraformaldehyde (crystalline) Sigma Catalog #P6148 rhodamine-labeled phalloidin Life Technologies Catalog #R415 vectashield mounting medium Vector Labs Catalog #H100 Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate Invitrogen Catalog # H-1398 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 16539-06 2% osmium tetroxide Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 19150 Biological samples G0 and S0 adult y w and hopTum-l flies (genotypes below) This study N/A G0 and S0 y w and hopTum-l larvae This study N/A G1 and S1 y w and hopTum-l larvae This study N/A G0 and S0 Leptopilina boulardi 17 adult wasps This study N/A G0 and S0 Leptopilina heterotoma 14 adult wasps This study N/A Critical commercial assays RNA extraction RNA/Protein Purification plus kit Norgen Catalog # 48200 Non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for RNA-Seq sequencing libraries New England Biolabs Catalog #E7775 Deposited data Drosophila RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-583; OSDR ID: OSD-588; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-588;https://doi.org/10.26030/v9rh-5a70 Leptopilina boulardi RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-587; OSDR ID: OSD-610; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-610;https://doi.org/10.26030/9ee4-6s36 Leptopilina heterotoma RNA-Seq data NASA Open Science Data Repository GeneLab ID: GLDS-586; OSDR ID: OSD-609; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-609;https://doi.org/10.26030/5rjq-a347 Experimental models: Organisms/strains y1 w1 Bloomington Stock Center BDSC:1495 y w hopTum-lmsn-Gal4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-lmsn > GFP Panettieri et al., 201929 PMID: 31562189 L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) Schlenke et al., 20078 PMID: 34051038 L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14) Schlenke et al., 20078 PMID: 34051038 Wing color mutant: L. heterotoma14 aurum1 This study Lh14 aurum1 Wing shape and ovipositor mutant:L. heterotoma14 kona1 This study Lh14 kona1 Software and algorithms Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud v20-v24 Adobe https://www.adobe.com/ Pipeline for Drosophila RNA-Seq data NASA GeneLab: Open Science for Life in Space GL-DPPD-7101-D; https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md Slurm and R scripts to process and analyze Leptopilina boulardi RNA-Seq data and Leptopilina heterotoma RNA-Seq data This study, supplement Data S1 Other 25 mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size) Whatman Catalog # 110605 SEM specimen mount stubs Electron Microscopy Sciences Catalog # 75110 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Genewiz) Illumina, San Diego https://www.Illumina.com Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (GeneLab) Illumina, San Diego https://www.Illumina.com Open in a new tabResource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Shubha Govind (sgovind@ccny.cuny.edu).Materials availability This study generated two mutant strains of Leptopilina heterotoma.

Experimental model and study participant details Experimental design and sample preparation D. melanogaster strains y1 w1 and y w hopTum-l msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-l msn > GFP),24 and wasp species L. boulardi strain 17 (Lb17) and L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14),8 were included in the ground control and flight experiments. The hopTum-l strain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog, hopscotch.22 This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, the misshapen (msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62 Expression of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors. Extensive pre-flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day flight period. Six conditions (two fly-only cultures, four fly/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The fly-only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12 mL ± 1 mL fly food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL ± 1 mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum. Prior to launch, y w fly-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. The hopTum-l cultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For the y w co-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg-laying. For hopTum-l egg-lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch.Mission and hardware details Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63 Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule. A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York.Condition of insect cultures Visual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the fly food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 fly-only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufficient early instar larvae to set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures developed under corresponding conditions, while adult fly samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials.Method details Survival studies Animals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For fly-only cultures, statistical analysis was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co-cultures, statistical analysis was performed on the number of flies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete. The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.Dissections, staining, and imaging Depending on sample availability, 5–15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, staining, and imaging were previously published.64,65,66,67 Lymph glands were counter-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). For Lh-infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti-p40 antibody9,20 (1:1000) was used. Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging software in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected using the Magnafire-SP software.Mitotic index Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l adult flies (described above) were set up at 25°C. Three to five wandering third-instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 μg/mL BCIP and 250 μg/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.Adult tumorigenesis Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0 hopTum-l adults (20 males and 5–10 females, ∼22°C) were scored 6.5 days (25°C) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0 hopTum-l flies was reared at 27°C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-lay.24 Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student’s t test was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other.Infection and larval host immunity assay Egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l flies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25°C for 3 days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times. Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions. hopTum-l tumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight’s effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small- and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae. Uninfected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.Bulk RNA-Seq sample preparation methods For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer. For adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0 y w; (b) S0 y w; (c) G0 hopTum-l; (d) S0 hopTum-l were used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0 Lb17 and Lh14 wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1 y w animals. In addition, RNA was also extracted from hopTum-l larvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (d) S0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i) G0 Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0 Lh-infected S1 hosts. The RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2 × 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was ∼300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane. The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at −80°C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).Processing of Drosophila RNA-Seq data The reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. D. melanogaster STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A majority (90.08%–94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the fly reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69 median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Analysis of Drosophila RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples DEGs in adult fly samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.070 and the Drosophila database (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13). EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular function.71 Results were visualized by R package.72Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding ∼280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these ∼280 genes were examined in FlyBase37 and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from ∼3- to 12-fold. For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76 Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41 which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78 For larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA-Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA-Seq results above.Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. L. heterotoma Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and the Lh14 GAJC contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz). L. boulardi Bowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, with Lb17 GAJA contig transcriptome reference from  (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz). Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) for Lb17 and Lh14 were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressed Lb17 and Lh14 DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20 - 59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (Tables S2 and S3).Analysis of parasite RNA-Seq results Global analyses Principal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified.Identification and analysis of parasite EV transcripts Proteins from purified Lb17 EV have not been characterized, but the composition of purified EVs from the Lb Gotheron (LbG) strain is published.14 To identify differentially expressed Lb17 EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383 LbG EV proteins, we queried the LbG EV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressed Lb17 transcripts in space (Table S2; LbG EV query sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, ’s tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62; gap costs existence extension 1, filtered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E-value ≤1 e−30, query coverage ≥50%, and percent identity of ≥50% were scored as high confidence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table 1), either due to their high log (2)-FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E = 3.00 e−100, query coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E = 4.00 e−30, query coverage 57%, and % identity 32.69). An estimate of the overall Lb17 EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383 LbG sequences were used to tblastn-search the GAJA00000000 sequences.47 This search identified 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E ≤ 1 e−50, query coverage ≥70%, percent identity ≥70%;  BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81 Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of the LbG EV proteins are expressed in the Lb17 female abdomen. Since the Lh14 EV proteome is already characterized,11,12 tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310 Lh14 DEGs (Table 2).SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60°C oven for 2 h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.Virulence assay for Lh14 venom Forty hopTum-l larvae were bled in 200 μL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 μL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0 Lh14 wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 μg of venom protein was added to the slide chamber with hopTum-l hemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4 h at 25°C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’s t test statistic was applied to determine the significance.Isolation and characterization of L. heterotoma mutants G0/S0 Lb17 and Lh14 male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0 Lb17 or G0 Lh14 screens. One Lh14 grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. This aurum1 male was mated with “lab” females; the progeny was “selfed” to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. The aurum1 strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock was established. A second mutant phenotype was observed in the aurum1 wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of this aurum1 wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant, kona1, assorted from the aurum1 mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygous kona1 females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11 kona1 male-mated, heterozygous or homozygous kona1 females, were introduced to y w hosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs. To examine if aurum1 and kona1 mutations assort independently, unmated homozygous aurum1 females were mated with kona1 males. Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds of y w infections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored. Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous kona1 females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygous kona1 females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope.Quantification and statistical analysis Sample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corresponding figure legend. For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (± standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean ± standard error was calculated, and a Student’s t test was used to determine biological significance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.Acknowledgments We are grateful to Edina Blazevic, Jackson Chen, Amy Gresser, Ye He, Waleed Khalid, Kevin Martin, Leo Mazur, Jorge Morales, and Zubaidul Razzak for assistance with experiments or analysis.

    "title": "Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555395/",
    "abstract": "Abstract During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μG) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μG on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μG. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μG conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μG conditions. Keywords: lymphoblast, microgravity, space radiation, chromosome aberration",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Astronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity (μG) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceflight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative effective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv) [1]. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells [2]. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk [3,4], but also negatively affects the function of the cardiovascular [5,6], central nervous [7,8] and immune [9,10,11] systems. The effects of μG on mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that μG affects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates [12,13,14,15]. In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the effect of exposing cells simultaneously to μG and space radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts’ health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined effects of space radiation and μG, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.) [16]. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental effects), but some did not. Performing experiments in space is challenging since there is a limited number of opportunities (if any) to repeat the same experiment under the same condition. The sequential treatments, such as cells being irradiated and then exposed to simulated μG, have been used in some ground-based experiments. In these experiments, cells are not exposed to radiation and μG at the same time. There are only a few cases in which cells were irradiated while being under the simulated μG condition. However, for the experiments of this type, it was often necessary to stop clinostat rotation in order to irradiate cells. Recently, we have developed a ground-based system for irradiating cells while they are under simulated μG using a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat [17,18] as a new system for ground-based space environment studies. This system allows the irradiating of cells without stopping the rotation of the clinostat, hence it is truly simultaneous exposure. As the clinostat rotates, the platform on which cell culture chambers are mounted becomes perpendicular to the direction of the irradiation beam every minute. Cells are irradiated for 0.2 s with either X-ray or carbon ion (C-ion) beam. For X-ray irradiation, a high-speed shutter located in front of the beam port opens for 0.2 s. For C-ion bean irradiation, a respiratory gating system for heavy ion treatment is used. Using these experimental set-ups, we have earlier studied the combined effects of radiation and μG on human fibroblasts, which are adherent cells. We found that the expression of cell cycle-suppressing genes decreased, and that of cell cycle-promoting genes increased after C-ion irradiation under μG compared with irradiation [19]. The cell cycle may pass through the checkpoints with DNA damage due to the combined effects of C-ion and μG, suggesting that increased genomic instability might occur in space [19]. Indeed, we also found an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cells exposed to both radiation and μG, compared to those treated by radiation only [20]. In this work, we studied the combined effects of simulated μG and irradiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, which were originally isolated from spontaneous immortalized lymphoblastic WIL2 cells [21]. TK6 cells are relatively stable and express the wild-type tumor suppressor p53 gene [22]. Unlike fibroblasts that are adherent cells, TK6 cells grow in suspension. TK6 cells are commonly used in radiation studies to investigate genomic instability [23,24,25] and known to be highly radiosensitive due to efficient radiation-induced apoptosis [26]. The endpoints measured in this study were cell survival and CA.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture Cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Since the experiment was performed outside the CO2 incubator, cells were cultured in CO2-independent medium (COI) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA), 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and 1% (ν/ν) penicillin–streptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and kept at 37 °C. We also used RPMI medium (Thermo Fischer Scientific) containing 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals), 1% (ν/ν) penicillin–streptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque) and 10 mM-HEPES (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for checking cellar growth. We used disposable, sealed irradiation cell culture chambers (DCC) (Chiyoda Co., Kanagawa, Japan) [27,28]. Exponentially growing cells were seeded into DCC. 2.2. Simultaneous Exposure of Cells to Radiation and Simulated μG A system for subjecting cultured cells simultaneously to radiation and simulated-μG (SSS) using a 3D clinostat (PMS-CST I, Advanced Engineering Services Co. Ltd. (AES), Ibaraki, Japan) has been previously described [20]. Cells were irradiated under the simulated μG condition without stopping the clinostat motion. We used an X-ray generator (200 kV, 14.6 mA, aluminum filter (0.3 mm thick), MultiRad225: Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, Tucson, AZ, USA), and a high-speed shutter (Accelerator Engineering Co., Chiba, Japan) placed in front of the X-ray irradiation port for synchronized X-ray irradiation. For synchronized C-ion irradiation, a synchrotron (Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center, Gunma, Japan) and respiratory gating systems were used. The dose-averaged linear energy transfer is 50 keV/μm at the center of the 6 cm spread-out Bragg peak of the beam, with an energy of 290 MeV/n [29]. Cells were irradiated by a 0.2 s pulse of beam when the cell chamber on the clinostat stage becomes perpendicular to the direction of irradiation beam, which took place once every minute. The X:Y ratios of clinorotation were set at 11:13 rpm and = 66°/s:78°/s, to accurately synchronize irradiation when the samples were in a horizontal position. For the control, cells in the chamber were mounted on a stationary clinostat to achieve static condition (1G), with the same pulse irradiation [17,18,29,30]. The dose rate was approximately 0.03 Gy/min for both X-ray and C-ion irradiation under the simulated μG or 1G conditions. Peltier modules were loaded on the 3D clinostat and the static stage, to maintain constant temperature at 37 °C [17]. Figure 1 shows the details of experimental flow. Frozen TK6 cells were revived and cultured for 4 days prior to seeding into DCCs at the concentration of 8 × 104 cells/mL. The chamber was set on the 3D clinostat. Cells were on the clinostat (or the stationary clinostat) for 24 h prior to irradiation. The cells were then irradiated with X-ray or C-ion under μG condition without stopping clinostat rotation. For survival fraction analysis, cells were harvested immediately after irradiation, in order to observe the effect of radiation in the cells’ exposure under μG or 1G conditions. Regarding CA, cells were kept under μG or 1G conditions for 24 h after irradiation, to observe the unrepaired DNA damages. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Scheme of experimental flow for cell survival and chromosome aberrations (CA) studies. Cells grown in disposable, sealed irradiation cell culture chambers (DCC) cassettes were mounted on the clinostat and exposed to X-ray or C-ion, with or without rotating clinostat. 2.3. Cell Survival Fraction Analysis After irradiation, TK6 cells were collected from DCCs and seeded into 96-well plates at various densities depending on the dose and type of radiation, which affected cell survival differently. For X-ray irradiation cells, seeding density was 1.6 cells/mL. For C-ion irradiation, cells were seeded with 1.6 cells/mL for 0.25 Gy, 16 cells/mL for 1.0 Gy, and densities were variable for 0.5 Gy and 0.75 Gy. The plates were incubated for 10–14 days at 37 °C. The wells with the culture medium color change from red to yellow were defined as having colonies, while those with no-color change were defined as no colony formation. We calculated plating efficiency (PE) and survival fraction using the following formula. PE = (−ln (EW/TW))/N (1) where EW is the number of wells with colonies, TW is total number of wells, and N is the average number of cells initially plated per well. Survival fraction (%) = (PE of treatment group)/(PE of control group) × 100 (2) where the treatment group is exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously, the control group is exposed to radiation only. Three 96 well-plates were made for each irradiation scheme (X-ray stationary, X-ray clinostat, C-ion stationary, C-ion clinostat), 288 well for each scheme were analyzed. 2.4. Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) We used the PCC technique to collect G2/M-phase chromosomes as previously described [31,32,33]. After irradiation, TK6 cells were kept for 24 h under static or μG conditions, to allow them to repair damaged DNA. Then, the cells were split into T75 flask at low density and subcultured at 37 °C. After incubation for 22 h, we added KaryoMAX® Colcemid® solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the final concentration of 90 ng/mL in the culture medium, to arrest the cells in mitosis, and incubated them for an additional 7 h before harvesting. Approximately 30 min before harvesting, 50 nM of Calyculin A (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) was added to the culture, so that chromosomes in the G2 phase in the cell cycle would be condensed. 2.5. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) CA was analyzed as previously described [20,34]. Chromosomes were spread on slides and hybridized in situ with a combination of three fluorescence whole-chromosome human DNA probes for chromosomes 1 (red), 2 (green) and 4 (yellow) (Aquarius, Cytocell, Oxford Gene Technology, Oxfordshire, UK), according to the recommended protocol by the manufacturer. Then, we used DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain all chromosomes. The complex exchange was defined as two or more chromosomes containing three or more breaks [32]. The simple exchange was defined as an exchange of arms between two chromosomes, resulting in dicentrics and translocations. Incomplete translocations and incomplete dicentrics were classified as simple exchanges, assuming that, in most cases, the reciprocal fragments are below the level of detection. Each type of exchange (dicentrics, apparently simple reciprocal exchanges, incompletes, or complex) was counted as one exchange, and values for total exchanges were derived by adding the yields. When two or more painted chromosomes were damaged, each was scored separately. At least 1000 cells were scored or headed up to 50 aberrations for each data point in the sample of each irradiation dose. 2.6. Statistical Analysis We calculated the ratio between aberrations scored and total cells analyzed for the frequencies of CA as reported previously [20]. Several studies have indicated that the distribution of radiation damages among chromosomes is random, and the yield of exchanges measured within the first division after exposure is proportional to the DNA content of the chromosome analyzed, with some fluctuation of data [35]. We extrapolated the frequencies of exchanges in individual chromosomes to whole-genome equivalents using the following formula reported by Lucas et al. [36]. Fp = 2.05[fp(1 − fp) + fp1fp2 + fp1fp3 + fp2fp3]FG (3) where Fp is the combined frequency of exchanges in all painted chromosomes; fp is the fraction of the whole genome comprised of the painted chromosomes; fp1, fp2 and fp3 are the fractions of the genome for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4, respectively; and FG is the whole-genome aberration frequency. From this formula, the genomic frequency for TK6 cells was calculated to be 2.48 times that detected on chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. Standard errors for aberration frequencies were calculated assuming Poisson statistics. Error bars in the figure represent the standard error of the mean values. The Fisher’s exact test was used to assess whether the difference in frequency of chromosome exchanges is significant between different treatment groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the effect of radiation dose and gravity on total exchanges, using total exchange as dependent variable and radiation dose and gravity as independent variables.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Cell Survival Figure 2a shows the growth of TK6 cells cultured in regular RPMI medium in a CO2 incubator and COI medium. Compared to the RPMI medium, cell growth was slower in the COI medium. Under the culturing condition using the COI medium, the doubling time was 24 h. Figure 2b shows the survival fraction irradiated by X-ray and 290 MeV/n C-ion under the static condition. Since cells were irradiated by 0.2-s pulses under simulated μG and at 1G static condition, the survival study was conducted using the 0.2-s pulse exposure, as well as continuous exposure. After maintaining μG or 1G condition for 24 h and irradiation, the unirradiated cell numbers of 1G condition were 1.28 × 105 ± 0.222 cells/mL, while the unirradiated cell numbers under μG condition were 1.17 × 105 ± 0.354 cells/mL. For each dose level, the cumulative dose of pulse irradiation was the same as that of continuous exposure. There was no significant difference in the survival fraction between μG and 1G. Compared to the survival curve for cells irradiated by X-ray which showed a shoulder, the exponential survival curve for C-ion had no such shoulder. C-ion was more lethal than X-ray per unit dose.

The error bar indicated the standard error of the mean. n = 3 for each time point. (b) Survival fraction of TK6 cells irradiated by 0.2 s pulses of X-ray (blue circle) or 290 MeV/n C-ion (red triangle) under the μG (unfilled) or 1G (filled) condition. Experimental data represent the mean of two to three plates for each dose experiment.Under the pulse irradiation mode, a total dose of 0.5 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 1.1 Gy X-ray exposure resulted in similar cell survival. We also found that 0.25 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 0.5 Gy X-ray exposure had similar cell survival fraction. Based on these results, we selected the cumulative doses of 0.5 Gy, 1.1 Gy and 1.5 Gy for X-ray, 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy for C-ion, to assess the combined effect of simulated μG and radiation on CA in TK6 cells. 3.2. CA Figure 3 shows 3-color chromosome FISH images, in which chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow) are stained. All chromosomes were stained by DAPI (blue). Figure 3a shows normal chromosome with no damages. Other panels show chromosomes that are damaged in various ways (see figure legend). All types of detectable aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were scored, and the whole-genome equivalent frequencies of aberrations were calculated. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Examples of 3-color whole-chromosome FISH staining images of TK6 cells: chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow).

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Humans will face the unique environment in space, represented by both μG and the space radiation, which contains a wide variety of ion species with various ranges of energy. It is challenging to simulate these space environments in one’s laboratory. Although many studies have reported the increased sensitivity of cells to radiation and decreased levels of DNA repair under simulated μG, most of these studies were performed using X-ray or γ-ray [16]. In the future Mars missions, GCR exposure, made up of high-energy and charged nuclei, will be of more serious concern than low linear energy transfer (LET) exposure. For this reason, it is important to investigate the effects of both low- and high-LET exposure under the μG. In our previous studies, we have shown changes in cell cycle-related genes expression [19] and increased frequency of CA [20] in human fibroblasts using our unique SSS [17,18]. CA data obtained from chromosome 1, 2 and 4 were extrapolated to the whole genome using a modified version of the equation of Lucas et al. [36]. Originally, Lucas reported the formula to calculate whole- genome exchange frequency based on low-LET radiation exposure. Although damages caused by high-LET exposure were expected to different form damages induced by low-LET exposure, we applied this modified formula in many cases of single-mono energetic ion beams in various LET, as well as mixed beam [33,37,38], and the results were in good agreement with the CA frequencies simulated by Monte Carlo modeling both single beam and mixed beams [39,40,41]. This formula is applicable to high-LET exposure in the range of doses we used in this study. CA has been shown to increase in the lymphocytes of astronauts after long missions lasting for several months in space [42,43,44]. CA is positively correlated with increased incidents of cancer [43,44,45]. Therefore, CA is a gold standard in the biodosimetry for radiation, and has been used for the risk assessment of space radiation. To follow up our previous study with adherent 1BR-hTERT cells [20], we used non-adherent TK6 cells to investigate whether the similar combined effect of radiation and μG on CA frequency is observed. Compared to the cells exposed to radiation only, higher frequencies of CA were found in TK6 cells under the condition of simultaneous exposure to radiation and μG (Figure 4). Our study indicates that this combined effect is independent of radiation types, as both X-ray and C-ion beams were more detrimental under μG than 1G. Thus, our study suggests that the effects of ionizing radiation and μG are more than additive and that astronauts’ risk of CA increases during long space flights. We observed higher frequencies of CA in TK6 cells with the same dose of irradiation. Under the same survival fraction dose, we detected increased incidence of the complex type of CA in TK6 cells, although the frequency of total CA was similar between TK6 cells and 1BR-hTERT cells. It is not clear if this difference is due to higher radio sensitivity of TK6 cells than that of 1BR-hTERT or due to the way these cells are cultured: adherent and floating. It is reported that there was wide variation in chromatid break frequencies, but it was only slightly higher than that reported for primary human cells in TK6. The dicentric frequency was more than 10-fold higher for TK6 cells than that reported for normal primary human cells. TK6 cells also show much higher levels of non-reciprocal chromosome translocations than are usually observed in primary human cells [46]. The higher frequency of the complexed exchanges in TK6 compare to fibroblasts in our study supports a previous report. The extent of the combined effect might depend on the cell types. Further investigation is needed sing different cell types. Manti et al. reported no effects of simulated μG on CA in human lymphocytes irradiated with X-ray or proton beam [47], whereas Mosesso et al. showed increased CA in human lymphocytes irradiated by 1.5 Gy of X-ray [48]. Our results on both adherent [20] and floating (current study) cells support the results of Mosesso et al. [48]. More importantly, we have observed these effects, not only with X-ray exposure, but also with relatively low dose of C-ion exposure as well, which is more relevant for the condition in the ISS [49,50,51,52]. These results support the reports of increased genomic damages in human lymphoblasts exposed to ionizing radiation under simulated μG conditions compared to 1G [53,54]. Based on the cell survival analysis, we irradiated cells with the doses that induce the same survival fraction. Compared to the cell irradiated with X-ray, higher frequencies of CA were observed with C-ion irradiation. It is well known that CA induction by heavy ions indicates a higher frequency of complex exchanged compare to low-LET radiation, and the observed rearrangements are of greater complexity [55]. The complex type of CA observed in cells irradiated with C-ion are higher compare to irradiated to X-ray both under μG and 1G in this study. Monte Carlo simulations as well as various other experiments indicate that complex DNA lesions with multiple damage sites, including double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and other damages within one or two helical turns referred to as clustered DNA damage are caused by heavy ion irradiation [56,57]. DNA breaks by X-ray irradiation are much less clustered, and it is likely to be repaired properly. Since clustered DNA breaks are difficult to correctly repair, breaks made by heavy ion irradiation are more likely to cause CAs. In this study, no significant difference was observed in cell survival between μG and 1G, suggesting that the extent of all cause cell death including apoptosis is the same. Since the frequency of CAs was greatly increased by simultaneous exposure to simulated μG and radiation compared to radiation alone, it is possible that cells were proliferating with unrepaired CA. For the survival fraction analysis in this study, cells were first acclimatized to the simulated μG or 1G condition, then irradiated under the respective gravitational condition, and seeded for culturing at 1G immediately after irradiation (Figure 1). The exact reasons for increased CA under simulated μG have not been fully elucidated to date. Previous studies suggest that the expression of DNA repair genes was decreased in human lymphoblasts grown under simulated μG [58], and that CA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes were enhanced by simulated μG through inhibition of DNA repair [59]. These results appear to establish correlation between decreased expression of DNA repair genes and CA found in cells exposed to μG. In our previous study, we found decreased cell cycle-suppressing gene and increased cell cycle-promoting genes on human fibroblasts grown under μG and C-ion irradiation. It was suggested that cells containing DNA damages induced by the combined stimulation with μG and C-ion may be allowed to rapidly pass through the cell cycle checkpoints without complete DNA repair, and that this may induce increased CA in these cells [19]. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Although comparison of simulated μG and 1G in each dose did not have enough statistical power to show significant difference (only 3 cases sowed p < 0.05 in Table 1), the multivariate logistical regression analysis provided significant contributions of μG in frequency of total exchanges (Table 2). Independent of radiation exposure dose, simulated μG cause 1.635 and 1.487 times of total exchanges, in comparison to 1G under X-ray and C-ion radiation exposure, respectively (Table 2). Taken together, our results discussed above indicate that the effects of μG and radiation are more than additive. We are aware that results from in vitro studies cannot be directly applied to in vivo biological events. The ground-based simulated μG does not exactly recapitulate the μG in space. However, there is limited access for spaceflight experiments. It is difficult to perform a sufficient number of replicated experiments in space to establish statistical significance. Additionally, experiments on the ISS do not give a deep space radiation environment. Thus, it is important to perform ground-based experiments using various devices that simulate the simultaneous exposure of cells and animals to μG and radiation. We trust that the results from such studies will be useful in assessing various risks of space travel, and eventually coming up with means of mitigation. Further investigations are in progress. Furthermore, we anticipate that our experimental results will corroborate the recent model calculations of radiation risk uncertainties [60].",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Higher incidence of CA in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells was demonstrated when the cells were exposed to radiation (X-ray and C-ion) under simulated μG than when exposed to the same level of radiation only. Our findings show that the space radiation risk assessment on human health based on experiments performed at 1G may result in underestimating astronauts’ potential risk for cancer and other debilitating health conditions due to GCR. We found that C-ion irradiation induced a higher frequency of complex type of CA compared to X-ray irradiation at the same cell survival fraction dose. The occurrence of complex CA was higher in TK6 cells than in human fibroblasts that we used earlier in similar CA studies. Our results suggest the importance of conducting similar studies using not only different cell types and radiation doses and types, but also other end points and model systems under the combined environment of μG and radiation.",

Copyright notice ID: 7555395 PMID: 32927618 Abstract During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μG) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μG on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μG. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μG conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μG conditions. Keywords: lymphoblast, microgravity, space radiation, chromosome aberration1. Introduction Astronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity (μG) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceflight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative effective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv) [1]. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells [2]. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk [3,4], but also negatively affects the function of the cardiovascular [5,6], central nervous [7,8] and immune [9,10,11] systems. The effects of μG on mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that μG affects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates [12,13,14,15]. In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the effect of exposing cells simultaneously to μG and space radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts’ health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined effects of space radiation and μG, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.) [16]. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental effects), but some did not. Performing experiments in space is challenging since there is a limited number of opportunities (if any) to repeat the same experiment under the same condition. The sequential treatments, such as cells being irradiated and then exposed to simulated μG, have been used in some ground-based experiments. In these experiments, cells are not exposed to radiation and μG at the same time. There are only a few cases in which cells were irradiated while being under the simulated μG condition. However, for the experiments of this type, it was often necessary to stop clinostat rotation in order to irradiate cells. Recently, we have developed a ground-based system for irradiating cells while they are under simulated μG using a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat [17,18] as a new system for ground-based space environment studies. This system allows the irradiating of cells without stopping the rotation of the clinostat, hence it is truly simultaneous exposure. As the clinostat rotates, the platform on which cell culture chambers are mounted becomes perpendicular to the direction of the irradiation beam every minute. Cells are irradiated for 0.2 s with either X-ray or carbon ion (C-ion) beam. For X-ray irradiation, a high-speed shutter located in front of the beam port opens for 0.2 s. For C-ion bean irradiation, a respiratory gating system for heavy ion treatment is used. Using these experimental set-ups, we have earlier studied the combined effects of radiation and μG on human fibroblasts, which are adherent cells. We found that the expression of cell cycle-suppressing genes decreased, and that of cell cycle-promoting genes increased after C-ion irradiation under μG compared with irradiation [19]. The cell cycle may pass through the checkpoints with DNA damage due to the combined effects of C-ion and μG, suggesting that increased genomic instability might occur in space [19]. Indeed, we also found an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cells exposed to both radiation and μG, compared to those treated by radiation only [20]. In this work, we studied the combined effects of simulated μG and irradiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, which were originally isolated from spontaneous immortalized lymphoblastic WIL2 cells [21]. TK6 cells are relatively stable and express the wild-type tumor suppressor p53 gene [22]. Unlike fibroblasts that are adherent cells, TK6 cells grow in suspension. TK6 cells are commonly used in radiation studies to investigate genomic instability [23,24,25] and known to be highly radiosensitive due to efficient radiation-induced apoptosis [26]. The endpoints measured in this study were cell survival and CA.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture Cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Since the experiment was performed outside the CO2 incubator, cells were cultured in CO2-independent medium (COI) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA), 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and 1% (ν/ν) penicillin–streptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and kept at 37 °C. We also used RPMI medium (Thermo Fischer Scientific) containing 10% (ν/ν) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals), 1% (ν/ν) penicillin–streptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque) and 10 mM-HEPES (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for checking cellar growth. We used disposable, sealed irradiation cell culture chambers (DCC) (Chiyoda Co., Kanagawa, Japan) [27,28]. Exponentially growing cells were seeded into DCC.2.2. Simultaneous Exposure of Cells to Radiation and Simulated μG A system for subjecting cultured cells simultaneously to radiation and simulated-μG (SSS) using a 3D clinostat (PMS-CST I, Advanced Engineering Services Co. Ltd. (AES), Ibaraki, Japan) has been previously described [20]. Cells were irradiated under the simulated μG condition without stopping the clinostat motion. We used an X-ray generator (200 kV, 14.6 mA, aluminum filter (0.3 mm thick), MultiRad225: Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, Tucson, AZ, USA), and a high-speed shutter (Accelerator Engineering Co., Chiba, Japan) placed in front of the X-ray irradiation port for synchronized X-ray irradiation. For synchronized C-ion irradiation, a synchrotron (Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center, Gunma, Japan) and respiratory gating systems were used. The dose-averaged linear energy transfer is 50 keV/μm at the center of the 6 cm spread-out Bragg peak of the beam, with an energy of 290 MeV/n [29]. Cells were irradiated by a 0.2 s pulse of beam when the cell chamber on the clinostat stage becomes perpendicular to the direction of irradiation beam, which took place once every minute. The X:Y ratios of clinorotation were set at 11:13 rpm and = 66°/s:78°/s, to accurately synchronize irradiation when the samples were in a horizontal position. For the control, cells in the chamber were mounted on a stationary clinostat to achieve static condition (1G), with the same pulse irradiation [17,18,29,30]. The dose rate was approximately 0.03 Gy/min for both X-ray and C-ion irradiation under the simulated μG or 1G conditions. Peltier modules were loaded on the 3D clinostat and the static stage, to maintain constant temperature at 37 °C [17]. Figure 1 shows the details of experimental flow. Frozen TK6 cells were revived and cultured for 4 days prior to seeding into DCCs at the concentration of 8 × 104 cells/mL. The chamber was set on the 3D clinostat. Cells were on the clinostat (or the stationary clinostat) for 24 h prior to irradiation. The cells were then irradiated with X-ray or C-ion under μG condition without stopping clinostat rotation. For survival fraction analysis, cells were harvested immediately after irradiation, in order to observe the effect of radiation in the cells’ exposure under μG or 1G conditions. Regarding CA, cells were kept under μG or 1G conditions for 24 h after irradiation, to observe the unrepaired DNA damages. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Scheme of experimental flow for cell survival and chromosome aberrations (CA) studies. Cells grown in disposable, sealed irradiation cell culture chambers (DCC) cassettes were mounted on the clinostat and exposed to X-ray or C-ion, with or without rotating clinostat.2.3. Cell Survival Fraction Analysis After irradiation, TK6 cells were collected from DCCs and seeded into 96-well plates at various densities depending on the dose and type of radiation, which affected cell survival differently. For X-ray irradiation cells, seeding density was 1.6 cells/mL. For C-ion irradiation, cells were seeded with 1.6 cells/mL for 0.25 Gy, 16 cells/mL for 1.0 Gy, and densities were variable for 0.5 Gy and 0.75 Gy. The plates were incubated for 10–14 days at 37 °C. The wells with the culture medium color change from red to yellow were defined as having colonies, while those with no-color change were defined as no colony formation. We calculated plating efficiency (PE) and survival fraction using the following formula. PE = (−ln (EW/TW))/N (1) where EW is the number of wells with colonies, TW is total number of wells, and N is the average number of cells initially plated per well. Survival fraction (%) = (PE of treatment group)/(PE of control group) × 100 (2) where the treatment group is exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously, the control group is exposed to radiation only. Three 96 well-plates were made for each irradiation scheme (X-ray stationary, X-ray clinostat, C-ion stationary, C-ion clinostat), 288 well for each scheme were analyzed.2.4. Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) We used the PCC technique to collect G2/M-phase chromosomes as previously described [31,32,33]. After irradiation, TK6 cells were kept for 24 h under static or μG conditions, to allow them to repair damaged DNA. Then, the cells were split into T75 flask at low density and subcultured at 37 °C. After incubation for 22 h, we added KaryoMAX® Colcemid® solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the final concentration of 90 ng/mL in the culture medium, to arrest the cells in mitosis, and incubated them for an additional 7 h before harvesting. Approximately 30 min before harvesting, 50 nM of Calyculin A (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) was added to the culture, so that chromosomes in the G2 phase in the cell cycle would be condensed.2.5. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) CA was analyzed as previously described [20,34]. Chromosomes were spread on slides and hybridized in situ with a combination of three fluorescence whole-chromosome human DNA probes for chromosomes 1 (red), 2 (green) and 4 (yellow) (Aquarius, Cytocell, Oxford Gene Technology, Oxfordshire, UK), according to the recommended protocol by the manufacturer. Then, we used DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain all chromosomes. The complex exchange was defined as two or more chromosomes containing three or more breaks [32]. The simple exchange was defined as an exchange of arms between two chromosomes, resulting in dicentrics and translocations. Incomplete translocations and incomplete dicentrics were classified as simple exchanges, assuming that, in most cases, the reciprocal fragments are below the level of detection. Each type of exchange (dicentrics, apparently simple reciprocal exchanges, incompletes, or complex) was counted as one exchange, and values for total exchanges were derived by adding the yields. When two or more painted chromosomes were damaged, each was scored separately. At least 1000 cells were scored or headed up to 50 aberrations for each data point in the sample of each irradiation dose.2.6. Statistical Analysis We calculated the ratio between aberrations scored and total cells analyzed for the frequencies of CA as reported previously [20]. Several studies have indicated that the distribution of radiation damages among chromosomes is random, and the yield of exchanges measured within the first division after exposure is proportional to the DNA content of the chromosome analyzed, with some fluctuation of data [35]. We extrapolated the frequencies of exchanges in individual chromosomes to whole-genome equivalents using the following formula reported by Lucas et al. [36]. Fp = 2.05[fp(1 − fp) + fp1fp2 + fp1fp3 + fp2fp3]FG (3) where Fp is the combined frequency of exchanges in all painted chromosomes; fp is the fraction of the whole genome comprised of the painted chromosomes; fp1, fp2 and fp3 are the fractions of the genome for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4, respectively; and FG is the whole-genome aberration frequency. From this formula, the genomic frequency for TK6 cells was calculated to be 2.48 times that detected on chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. Standard errors for aberration frequencies were calculated assuming Poisson statistics. Error bars in the figure represent the standard error of the mean values. The Fisher’s exact test was used to assess whether the difference in frequency of chromosome exchanges is significant between different treatment groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the effect of radiation dose and gravity on total exchanges, using total exchange as dependent variable and radiation dose and gravity as independent variables.3. Results 3.1. Cell Survival Figure 2a shows the growth of TK6 cells cultured in regular RPMI medium in a CO2 incubator and COI medium. Compared to the RPMI medium, cell growth was slower in the COI medium. Under the culturing condition using the COI medium, the doubling time was 24 h. Figure 2b shows the survival fraction irradiated by X-ray and 290 MeV/n C-ion under the static condition. Since cells were irradiated by 0.2-s pulses under simulated μG and at 1G static condition, the survival study was conducted using the 0.2-s pulse exposure, as well as continuous exposure. After maintaining μG or 1G condition for 24 h and irradiation, the unirradiated cell numbers of 1G condition were 1.28 × 105 ± 0.222 cells/mL, while the unirradiated cell numbers under μG condition were 1.17 × 105 ± 0.354 cells/mL. For each dose level, the cumulative dose of pulse irradiation was the same as that of continuous exposure. There was no significant difference in the survival fraction between μG and 1G. Compared to the survival curve for cells irradiated by X-ray which showed a shoulder, the exponential survival curve for C-ion had no such shoulder. C-ion was more lethal than X-ray per unit dose. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Cell growth and survival. (a) The growth of TK6 cells cultured in RPMI medium (white) or in CO2-independent medium (COI) (black) is shown. The error bar indicated the standard error of the mean. n = 3 for each time point. (b) Survival fraction of TK6 cells irradiated by 0.2 s pulses of X-ray (blue circle) or 290 MeV/n C-ion (red triangle) under the μG (unfilled) or 1G (filled) condition. Experimental data represent the mean of two to three plates for each dose experiment.Under the pulse irradiation mode, a total dose of 0.5 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 1.1 Gy X-ray exposure resulted in similar cell survival. We also found that 0.25 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 0.5 Gy X-ray exposure had similar cell survival fraction. Based on these results, we selected the cumulative doses of 0.5 Gy, 1.1 Gy and 1.5 Gy for X-ray, 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy for C-ion, to assess the combined effect of simulated μG and radiation on CA in TK6 cells.3.2. CA Figure 3 shows 3-color chromosome FISH images, in which chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow) are stained. All chromosomes were stained by DAPI (blue). Figure 3a shows normal chromosome with no damages. Other panels show chromosomes that are damaged in various ways (see figure legend). All types of detectable aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were scored, and the whole-genome equivalent frequencies of aberrations were calculated. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Examples of 3-color whole-chromosome FISH staining images of TK6 cells: chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow). CA are identified by arrows as simple (reciprocal exchanges between two chromosomes) or complex-type exchanges (three or more breaks in two or more chromosomes).

For each source of radiation, the frequency of CA increased with dose. The frequency of CA increased in cells exposed under the μG condition compared to those exposed under the static condition. At the same irradiation dose, CA was more frequently observed in C-ion irradiated cells than in X-ray irradiated counter parts. Furthermore, at the iso-survival fraction dose, C-ion irradiation produced more CA than X-ray irradiation. Figure 4.

Discussion Humans will face the unique environment in space, represented by both μG and the space radiation, which contains a wide variety of ion species with various ranges of energy. It is challenging to simulate these space environments in one’s laboratory. Although many studies have reported the increased sensitivity of cells to radiation and decreased levels of DNA repair under simulated μG, most of these studies were performed using X-ray or γ-ray [16]. In the future Mars missions, GCR exposure, made up of high-energy and charged nuclei, will be of more serious concern than low linear energy transfer (LET) exposure. For this reason, it is important to investigate the effects of both low- and high-LET exposure under the μG. In our previous studies, we have shown changes in cell cycle-related genes expression [19] and increased frequency of CA [20] in human fibroblasts using our unique SSS [17,18]. CA data obtained from chromosome 1, 2 and 4 were extrapolated to the whole genome using a modified version of the equation of Lucas et al. [36]. Originally, Lucas reported the formula to calculate whole- genome exchange frequency based on low-LET radiation exposure. Although damages caused by high-LET exposure were expected to different form damages induced by low-LET exposure, we applied this modified formula in many cases of single-mono energetic ion beams in various LET, as well as mixed beam [33,37,38], and the results were in good agreement with the CA frequencies simulated by Monte Carlo modeling both single beam and mixed beams [39,40,41]. This formula is applicable to high-LET exposure in the range of doses we used in this study. CA has been shown to increase in the lymphocytes of astronauts after long missions lasting for several months in space [42,43,44]. CA is positively correlated with increased incidents of cancer [43,44,45]. Therefore, CA is a gold standard in the biodosimetry for radiation, and has been used for the risk assessment of space radiation. To follow up our previous study with adherent 1BR-hTERT cells [20], we used non-adherent TK6 cells to investigate whether the similar combined effect of radiation and μG on CA frequency is observed. Compared to the cells exposed to radiation only, higher frequencies of CA were found in TK6 cells under the condition of simultaneous exposure to radiation and μG (Figure 4). Our study indicates that this combined effect is independent of radiation types, as both X-ray and C-ion beams were more detrimental under μG than 1G. Thus, our study suggests that the effects of ionizing radiation and μG are more than additive and that astronauts’ risk of CA increases during long space flights. We observed higher frequencies of CA in TK6 cells with the same dose of irradiation. Under the same survival fraction dose, we detected increased incidence of the complex type of CA in TK6 cells, although the frequency of total CA was similar between TK6 cells and 1BR-hTERT cells. It is not clear if this difference is due to higher radio sensitivity of TK6 cells than that of 1BR-hTERT or due to the way these cells are cultured: adherent and floating. It is reported that there was wide variation in chromatid break frequencies, but it was only slightly higher than that reported for primary human cells in TK6. The dicentric frequency was more than 10-fold higher for TK6 cells than that reported for normal primary human cells. TK6 cells also show much higher levels of non-reciprocal chromosome translocations than are usually observed in primary human cells [46]. The higher frequency of the complexed exchanges in TK6 compare to fibroblasts in our study supports a previous report. The extent of the combined effect might depend on the cell types. Further investigation is needed sing different cell types. Manti et al. reported no effects of simulated μG on CA in human lymphocytes irradiated with X-ray or proton beam [47], whereas Mosesso et al. showed increased CA in human lymphocytes irradiated by 1.5 Gy of X-ray [48]. Our results on both adherent [20] and floating (current study) cells support the results of Mosesso et al. [48]. More importantly, we have observed these effects, not only with X-ray exposure, but also with relatively low dose of C-ion exposure as well, which is more relevant for the condition in the ISS [49,50,51,52]. These results support the reports of increased genomic damages in human lymphoblasts exposed to ionizing radiation under simulated μG conditions compared to 1G [53,54]. Based on the cell survival analysis, we irradiated cells with the doses that induce the same survival fraction. Compared to the cell irradiated with X-ray, higher frequencies of CA were observed with C-ion irradiation. It is well known that CA induction by heavy ions indicates a higher frequency of complex exchanged compare to low-LET radiation, and the observed rearrangements are of greater complexity [55]. The complex type of CA observed in cells irradiated with C-ion are higher compare to irradiated to X-ray both under μG and 1G in this study. Monte Carlo simulations as well as various other experiments indicate that complex DNA lesions with multiple damage sites, including double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and other damages within one or two helical turns referred to as clustered DNA damage are caused by heavy ion irradiation [56,57]. DNA breaks by X-ray irradiation are much less clustered, and it is likely to be repaired properly. Since clustered DNA breaks are difficult to correctly repair, breaks made by heavy ion irradiation are more likely to cause CAs. In this study, no significant difference was observed in cell survival between μG and 1G, suggesting that the extent of all cause cell death including apoptosis is the same. Since the frequency of CAs was greatly increased by simultaneous exposure to simulated μG and radiation compared to radiation alone, it is possible that cells were proliferating with unrepaired CA. For the survival fraction analysis in this study, cells were first acclimatized to the simulated μG or 1G condition, then irradiated under the respective gravitational condition, and seeded for culturing at 1G immediately after irradiation (Figure 1). The exact reasons for increased CA under simulated μG have not been fully elucidated to date. Previous studies suggest that the expression of DNA repair genes was decreased in human lymphoblasts grown under simulated μG [58], and that CA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes were enhanced by simulated μG through inhibition of DNA repair [59]. These results appear to establish correlation between decreased expression of DNA repair genes and CA found in cells exposed to μG. In our previous study, we found decreased cell cycle-suppressing gene and increased cell cycle-promoting genes on human fibroblasts grown under μG and C-ion irradiation. It was suggested that cells containing DNA damages induced by the combined stimulation with μG and C-ion may be allowed to rapidly pass through the cell cycle checkpoints without complete DNA repair, and that this may induce increased CA in these cells [19]. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Although comparison of simulated μG and 1G in each dose did not have enough statistical power to show significant difference (only 3 cases sowed p < 0.05 in Table 1), the multivariate logistical regression analysis provided significant contributions of μG in frequency of total exchanges (Table 2). Independent of radiation exposure dose, simulated μG cause 1.635 and 1.487 times of total exchanges, in comparison to 1G under X-ray and C-ion radiation exposure, respectively (Table 2). Taken together, our results discussed above indicate that the effects of μG and radiation are more than additive. We are aware that results from in vitro studies cannot be directly applied to in vivo biological events. The ground-based simulated μG does not exactly recapitulate the μG in space. However, there is limited access for spaceflight experiments. It is difficult to perform a sufficient number of replicated experiments in space to establish statistical significance. Additionally, experiments on the ISS do not give a deep space radiation environment. Thus, it is important to perform ground-based experiments using various devices that simulate the simultaneous exposure of cells and animals to μG and radiation. We trust that the results from such studies will be useful in assessing various risks of space travel, and eventually coming up with means of mitigation. Further investigations are in progress. Furthermore, we anticipate that our experimental results will corroborate the recent model calculations of radiation risk uncertainties [60].5. Conclusions Higher incidence of CA in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells was demonstrated when the cells were exposed to radiation (X-ray and C-ion) under simulated μG than when exposed to the same level of radiation only. Our findings show that the space radiation risk assessment on human health based on experiments performed at 1G may result in underestimating astronauts’ potential risk for cancer and other debilitating health conditions due to GCR. We found that C-ion irradiation induced a higher frequency of complex type of CA compared to X-ray irradiation at the same cell survival fraction dose. The occurrence of complex CA was higher in TK6 cells than in human fibroblasts that we used earlier in similar CA studies. Our results suggest the importance of conducting similar studies using not only different cell types and radiation doses and types, but also other end points and model systems under the combined environment of μG and radiation.Acknowledgments We thank Kano (AEC) and Ishizaki (GHMC) for supporting our experiments.Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.T. and M.H.; methodology, A.T. and M.H.; investigation, S.Y., J.R., A.T. and M.H.; validation, J.-H.M.; data curation, M.H.; writing—original draft preparation, S.Y.; writing—review and editing, J.-H.M., A.T., K.F., P.B.S. and M.H.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Physical effects of microgravity during spaceflight can often be described by equations that allow their quantification [1, 2]. For example, microgravity has well-defined effects on sedimentation in association with reduced terminal velocity and shear in suspension culture [3] and reduced gravity-dependent convection of gases [4]. Biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are much harder to define [1, 2]. For example, spaceflight also entails radiation exposure, which has been studied in diverse systems but whose effects are not fully understood [5]. What is needed is a robust, unbiased, quantifiable system that is relevant for translation to ground-based applications and that is able to clearly distinguish spaceflight effects. It is our premise that yeast deletion collections are ideally suited for this type of analysis as yeast can be precisely controlled genetically and readily grown under spaceflight conditions. Biological responses of yeast strains during spaceflight can be quantified and compared to well-established databases of ground-based stressors and the comparisons can reveal features that are unique to microgravity as well as features that are shared with ground-based perturbations. While yeast cannot completely reflect the complexities of mammalian cells organized into tissues, the high degree of homology shared with human (~70% of all essential yeast genes have a significant human homolog) provides hypotheses for the mechanism of many responses of interest [6, 7]. Previous studies have attempted to identify, isolate, and offset the various physical factors changing during spaceflight to demonstrate their effects in an iterative fashion [8–10]. Earlier studies on the effects of space radiation on yeast failed to find any change in point mutation rates, DNA replication and/or repair, heritable damage, or colony morphology [5, 8, 11, 12]. However, those studies were limited by assay sensitivity. Here we applied the yeast deletion collection as a biological reporter to understand the metabolic pathways affecting survival during culture in spaceflight. In this fashion, we are able to make genome-wide comparisons and test for concordance against an extensive library of more than 3200 physical and pharmacological stressors [13]. Yeast is the first, and to date only, organism for which a complete, genome-wide knockdown collection is available. This collection is comprised of a genome-wide set of strains where each strain carries a precise deletion of a single gene [14]. Assembled over a four-year period by a consortium of 35 laboratories, this collection has been used by hundreds of laboratories to test thousands of different environmental stressors to define the genes required for survival in those conditions (see [15] for review). The molecular barcodes present in each strain allow the yeast deletion collection to be grown as a pool in the presence or absence of the stressor of interest after which the relative abundance of each strain is subsequently quantified [16]. Strains carrying a deletion of a gene required for survival in the presence of the stressor grow more slowly and thus exhibit a fitness defect reflected by their reduced abundance at the end of the culture period. In this manner, all genes required for growth can be readily identified in a single experiment, revealing the genes and associated pathways affected by the stressor. To identify the metabolic and genomic pathways affected by spaceflight, the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections were grown in spaceflight and ground control conditions, with and without hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second stressor. In spaceflight alone, the homozygous deletion collection revealed the importance of processes linked to mitochondria, while the heterozygous collection highlighted genes involved in regulating translation and ribosomal RNA transport. Both homozygous and heterozygous collections highlighted DNA repair. With the addition of NaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed the importance of RNA-related processes including ribosome assembly and biogenesis and mRNA processing and decay, as well as modification of tRNAs. Moreover, the NaCl addition highlighted replication processes more clearly (compared to the homozygous collection without NaCl), suggesting that spaceflight has measurable effects on these core and evolutionarily conserved processes. With the heterozygous collection, the addition of NaCl led to the identification of a nuclear pore organization gene, potentially providing additional insight into how RNA transport is affected by spaceflight. Taken together, the deletion collections identified several biological processes associated with spaceflight, and the additional hyperosmolar stress emphasized the importance of related processes. In a follow-up analysis, we queried the effects of spaceflight against a database of drug effects on yeast to search for those that are most concordant, thereby suggesting similar mechanisms of perturbation. Not only do the effects of spaceflight have relatively high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents, but also there is tight agreement amongst multiple therapeutic agents in this drug class, providing additional support for these findings.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Overall Design The Opticell Processing Module, described below, was used to perform a series of ~21 generation pooled growth experiments on two yeast deletion collections: (i) ~4800 homozygous strains and (ii) ~5900 heterozygous strains (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes), each carrying unique DNA barcodes that act as strain identifiers. Experiments were performed in both rich media and rich media supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl to assess the additional effect of osmotic stress on survival. The samples flew sortie on space shuttle mission STS-135 to the International Space Station (ISS). Parallel control experiments were performed in static 1G terrestrial controls in the Orbital Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center to match temperature, humidity, air composition, and volatile organic compounds. Ground controls were conducted in a 24-hour asynchronous fashion to allow matching of the experimental timelines on ISS as relayed through air-to-ground communication by the flight crew. At the end of the growth period, the fitness of each strain in each experimental pool was assessed as described [17]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, the barcodes in each pool were amplified by PCR, and the abundance of each barcode was quantified by next generation sequencing. A barcode count reflects the abundance of the corresponding strain at the end of the experiment, that is, a quantification of the relative requirement of the deleted gene for growth in the tested condition. In total, the experiment results in a count for each gene resulting in a gene list rank ordered by their importance for growth in the tested condition. 2.2. Yeast Deletion Pool Construction The yeast deletion collections were stored as individual strains in YPD containing 7% DMSO at −80°C, in 96-well plates. The plates were thawed, mixed, and robotically pinned onto YPD agar plates as an array of 384 strains. After two days of growth at 30°C, colonies were consolidated (four plates of 384 to one plate of 1536 colonies) and robotically pinned in triplicate. Cells were grown in 30°C for 2-3 days until colonies formed. Slow growing strains were grown separately for 2-3 additional days. All plates were then flooded with 5–7 mL of media, scraped and pooled in YPD + 7% DMSO to a final concentration of OD600 = 0.84, and frozen at −80°C until use, as described [17]. 2.3. Construction of Opticell Culture System and Spaceflight Experiment In this study, we designed the Opticell Processing Module or OPM (Figure 1) that was capable of maintaining the yeast deletion collection as a pool grown in liquid culture for at least 20 generations in microgravity. The hardware comprised a liquid-sealed system of growth chambers (Opticells) that allowed for gas exchange across polystyrene membranes. Each OPM consisted of three Nunc Opticells held together with a common manifold and valve system that is autoclaved and attached with watertight O-ring seals. A 3 mL syringe connected to the manifold with a Luer fitting is used to transfer liquid between chambers and mix without breaking sterility and with minimal operator intervention. The valve on the manifold has four settings that connect the syringe to the following port locations 1: Off position, 2: Opticell A, 3: Opticell B, or 4: Opticell C. The OPM allows propagation of each deletion collection for a combined ~21 generations of growth when three chambers are used and the inoculum and transfer volumes are 0.5 mL. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The Opticell Processing Module (OPM) designed for propagation of each deletion collection for ~21 generations of growth. The OPM comprises three commercially available optically clear chambers (Opticells, Nunc) that are joined by a manifold and scaffold that can be autoclaved and assembled rapidly. The manifold contains a multiway valve unit which mates to each Opticell or to an the off position using O-ring seals. The opposite side of the valve contains a Luer fitting into which a standard 3cc syringe is attached. To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers is filled with 7 mL of sterile growth media. Deletion pools are loaded into the inoculation syringe and then injected into Chamber A of the OPM, precooled to 4°C. Growth is initiated by warming the unit to 30°C. After 16–24 h, 0.5 mL is removed from Chamber A and injected and mixed into Chamber B using the same syringe. This is repeated to continue multigenerational growth in Chamber C.To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers was prefilled with 7 mL of sterile growth media. Deletion collection aliquots were preloaded into each syringe and shipped to Kennedy Space Center, frozen in media containing 7% DMSO (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. During final integration at Kennedy Space Center, the OPMs were prechilled to 4°C. Each deletion collection aliquot was thawed, attached to an OPM manifold, injected, and mixed into chamber A. Cultures were maintained at 4°C and flown to the International Space Station (ISS). The growth experiment was initiated on orbit by warming the OPMs to 30°C. After 16–24 h at 30°C, a 0.5 mL sample was removed from chamber A using the same syringe and inoculated into chamber B. The process was repeated 16–24 hours later to inoculate 0.5 mL of sample from chamber B into chamber C. After an additional 16–24 hours, the OPMs were cooled back down to 4°C to greatly reduce any further growth and preserve the samples for return to Earth and postflight analysis. Exponential yeast growth leads to early depletion of growth media nutrients and significant retardation of further growth well before 16–24 hours. Growth is limited by media volume and strain distribution within the yeast deletion library reaches a steady state within that Opticell. 2.4. Next Generation Sequencing The flight samples that returned from the ISS were handled in parallel with the ground control set. The OPM was disassembled into its three Opticells, and the entire contents were transferred to a storage tube using a blunt needle connected to a 20 mL syringe. One mL of each sample (at a final OD600 of 1.0-2.0) was processed to extract genomic DNA. Purified deletion pool DNA was amplified in two separate PCR reactions as described [17] and the amplicons purified prior to sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Each purified amplicon library was sequenced to a minimum depth of 500 counts/strain/sample as described [18]. Duplicate experiments were performed for all conditions, to ensure that at least one complete time course was collected for each pool (heterozygote and homozygote) and each condition. Due to failures in sample processing, several time points were not recovered or did not meet our in-house quality metrics (e.g., if sequence counts/strain were below threshold values). Accordingly, we focused on evaluating each experimental condition using singleton data as described in Table 1. Table 1. Experimental samples collected and available for analysis. Condition Zygosity Generations Ground Homozygous 7, 14, 21 Ground + 0.5 M NaCl Homozygous 7, 14, 21 Flight Homozygous 7, 14, 21 Flight + 0.5 M NaCl Homozygous 7, 14, 21 Ground Heterozygous 14, 21* Ground + 0.5 M NaCl Heterozygous 7, 14, 21 Flight Heterozygous 14, 21* Flight + 0.5 M NaCl Heterozygous 7, 14, 21 Open in a new tab *7-generation samples from the indicated condition were not available for analysis due to failures in sample processing or failure to meet in-house quality metrics as described in Methods. 2.5. Data Analysis All computational analyses were performed using R [19] unless otherwise indicated. 2.5.1. Normalization of Sequence Counts Sequence counts for each strain in each experiment were quantified and normalized according to [18]. Briefly, each 20-mer barcode was amplified with primers comprised of the common barcode primers in addition to the sequences required for cluster formation on the Illumina flow cell. For multiplexed Illumina sequencing, 5-mer tag sequences were incorporated into each primer between the Illumina and barcode primer sequences. This multiplexing tag allowed postsequencing assignment of each amplicon to a particular experiment. Results for the 7-generation time point of the heterozygous deletion pool grown in spaceflight without NaCl did not pass our quality control and, consequently, that time point was omitted from analyses of the heterozygous pool without NaCl. All other counts were mean-normalized between experiments such that each experiment had the same mean count. We added ten pseudocounts to all sequence tag tallies (and, thus, all subsequent gene tallies) to prevent division by zero during data analyses (see Table S1 and Table S2 for mean normalized counts in Supplementary Materials available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/976458).2.5.2. Barcode Selection for Each Strain For each strain, we used signal from only the upstream or the downstream barcode (relative to the deletion site). First, we assumed that barcode counts close to zero represent background noise (e.g., possibly due to incorrect mapping of reads to barcodes). We thus selected a background threshold (bgThreshold = 100; see Parameter Selection), assuming that counts below it do not accurately reflect strain abundance. Then, for each time course, we filtered out barcodes where the average (normalized) count for the first 14 generations (the earliest time point with usable data in all experiments) was below bgThreshold. This filtering removed all barcodes for ~650–3200 strains (depending on the time course), and these strains were omitted from subsequent analyses; see Supplementary Tables S3 (homozygous strains) and S4 (heterozygous strains). For time courses that only had two time points (and thus an inefficient number to compute fits), strains that still had two barcodes after filtering were represented by their upstream barcodes due to their overall better behavior observed in a previous study [20]. For other time courses, linear fits (with and without the time logged) were computed for each remaining barcode. We defined the best fit as the fit with the lowest residual sum of squares (RSS) and used the F-test to compute a P value estimating the significance with which the fitted model is better than the null model (of a flat line at the average count value). The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to correct the P for multiple comparisons and generate FDR values [21]. Strains with two remaining barcodes were represented by the barcode with the higher R 2 (a measure of the amount of variation in the data explained by the fitted model), because they manifest less noise and better fit the data.2.5.3. Parameter Selection The selected normalization method (tested mean and quartile normalization) and bgThreshold (tested 50, 100, and 150) is the combination that resulted in the most significant enrichment of slow growing strains identified in the heterozygous deletion pool, sampled every two generations for 20 generations (data not shown), with slow growers identified in a previous study [22]. Briefly, we defined slow growers as those exhibiting sizable decreases in abundance over time. The significance of the decrease was estimated with FDR values (see Barcode Selection for Each Strain), and the magnitude was estimated with ΔAUC = (〈area under the growth curve〉 − 〈area under the flat growth curve〉)/(t max⁡ − t 0), where the flat growth curve is fixed at the t 0 abundance level, and the area under a curve is estimated using the trapezoid method. Also, if at some time point the abundance of a strain is less than or equal to bgThreshold and remains at negligible levels for the rest of the time course, we identified the strain as slow growing.2.5.4. Identification of Significant Fitness Defects in Time Point Comparisons To identify strains that exhibited significant fitness defects at a later time point (14 or 21 generations) compared to the first time point (7 generations), normalized counts less than bgThreshold were first forced to equal bgThreshold. Then, for each strain, we computed log2ratio = log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G) where abundanceyG is the count of the strain at y generations. For a given time point, robust Z scores were computed from the set of log2ratios; for example, Z i = (log⁡2ratioi − 〈log⁡2ratio median〉)/〈log⁡2ratio MAD〉 for strain i. Each Z i was then used to obtain P i from the standard normal distribution, and we assume that strains with low P values are outliers in the distribution of log2ratios. Moreover, strains with counts above bgThreshold at the first time point and counts equivalent to bgThreshold at the later time point of interest are defined as having dropped out. Taken together, we define strains with significant fitness defects at a specific time point as strains with log2ratio ≥ 1 and P ≤ 0.001 and/or strains that dropped out (Table S5, Table S6).2.5.5. Spaceflight versus Ground Comparisons For comparisons involving specific time points, we identified the set of strains that exhibited significant fitness defects (relative to the first time point) in the flight condition but not in the ground condition. This set is then further restricted to the set of strains with useable data in both conditions.2.5.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis We obtained gene ontology (GO) annotations of yeast genes from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (downloaded on May 26, 2012). GO biological processes that were too specific (containing less than five genes) or too general (containing greater than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis. Given a query set of genes (e.g., genes deleted from a set of (flight-ground) strains), we used the hypergeometric test to obtain a P value estimating the significance with which the set is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process, relative to a gene universe defined as the set of genes with usable data for both flight and ground conditions. Due to a limited number of significantly enriched processes following correction for multiple comparisons (FDR ≤ 0.1), here we report significantly enriched processes prior to the correction (P ≤ 0.01). We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps shown in Figures 2 and 3 that were generated using an approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin v1.1 [23, 24]. In contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each map were clustered with MCL (inflation = 2), using the overlap coefficient computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefficients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes in the same cluster were assigned the same node color, and a cluster label was determined based on common themes in the processes within the cluster. Moreover, the size of a node was made to be proportional to the significance with which the corresponding process is enriched [−log10(P)]. Each bar plot summarizes the genes that contribute the most to the enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot border. Specifically, a plot shows the flight-associated genes that are annotated to the largest number of relevant processes (if more than 10 genes, only the top 10 are shown). For each gene, the bar length is proportional to a fitness defect measure (i.e., log2ratio). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with flight-specific fitness defects at different time points in the homozygous deletion series. Each node represents a significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test P ≤ 0.01). A circle node indicates enrichment at 14 generations compared to 7 generations (the first time point), a square node indicates enrichment at 21 generations compared to 7 generations, and a diamond node indicates enrichment at both 14 generations and 21 generations (see Methods). Node size is proportional to the significance of enrichment [−log10(P)]. Node color indicates processes that share genes (see Methods) and summary labels are shown for nodes of the same color. Edges indicate ≥ 50% gene overlap between connected processes; width is proportional to the degree of overlap. Each bar plot provides fitness defect (FD) scores for genes that contribute to the enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot border. Specifically, the length of a bar is proportional to the log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G), where abundanceyG represents the abundance of the corresponding gene deletion strain at y generations (see Methods). An “x” on the bar indicates that the abundance of the strain lowers to background level at later time point.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with flight-specific fitness defects in the presence of NaCl, at different time points in heterozygous deletion samples. Each node represents a significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test P ≤ 0.01). Nodes, edges, and plots are as specified for Figure 2.The enrichment maps also combine two sets of enrichment results, with the processes enriched in one set shown with circle nodes, the processes enriched in the second set shown with square nodes, and the processes enriched in both sets shown with diamond nodes.2.5.7. Similarity between Flight-Associated Genes and Compound-Associated Genes We previously treated pools of yeast deletion strains with ~3200 compounds separately [13]. Each compound was subsequently associated with a set of genes deleted from strains that exhibited significant fitness defects induced by the compound. Like sets of flight-associated genes in this study, sets of compound-associated genes were assessed for enrichment of genes annotated to specific biological processes (as described above), resulting in an “enrichment profile” for each condition of interest. In each profile, each process is associated with a P measuring the significance of enrichment. Similarity between a pair of enrichment profiles was computed by concordance of −log10(P) across all processes common to both profiles, where concordance is like Pearson correlation except that scale is not ignored. Compounds with enrichment profiles that are most similar to a given flight enrichment profile may induce cellular responses that are most similar to the response induced by flight.",

Results and Discussion Because we cannot distinguish the individual parameters that include flight, lack of gravity, and increased radiation, for the purposes of this paper, these are referred to collectively as “spaceflight” throughout the text. To measure the effects of spaceflight on the rate of yeast growth in the Opticell, we inoculated 0.5 mL of a yeast deletion pool into 7 mL of YPD, resulting in a starting OD600 of ~0.06/mL and incubated at 30°C. Following growth for ~24 hr (~7 generations), 0.5 mL of the saturated culture was inoculated into the second chamber. This process was repeated for the final growth phase in the third chamber. Population doubling time was ~100 min in microgravity compared to ~90 min in ground-based controls. Each sample was grown for seven generations/Opticell for a total of 21 generations (Table 1). Doubling times were back-calculated using the OD600 of the samples collected at each time point. The morphology of Opticell-grown yeast in spaceflight was indistinguishable from static controls when observed by light microscopy; for example, budding pattern, overall shape, and size were not detectably different in the two conditions. On scanning electron microscopy, there were budding polarity and ruffling changes in every field, but there were no consistent differences (data not shown). We assessed the yeast deletion collection samples for patterns of strain sensitivity in the following manner: barcode counts for each strain in each sample were measured and normalized as described in Methods. The counts were used to rank each strain in each sample in order of their importance for growth. Four different samples were available from both spaceflight and ground cultures: (1) homozygous deletion collection in YPD, (2) homozygous deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5 M NaCl, (3) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD, and (4) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5 M NaCl. Each culture was sampled at three different time points, 7 generations, 14 generations, and 21 generations, and shown in Table 1. Samples from ground controls were compared to the corresponding samples grown in microgravity on the ISS. We analyzed changes in strain abundance by comparing each time point to a later time point. Using this approach allowed us to capture those strains that became depleted in any seven-generation interval. Strains with sizable decreases in measured abundance or with abundances that drop to background levels (and remain there) were identified as exhibiting fitness defects (FDs). Moreover, strains with flight-specific FDs were identified by subtracting the strains with FDs in the ground condition. For the purposes of our gene ontology (GO; http://amigo.geneontology.org) enrichment analysis, we considered the homozygous and heterozygous data separately. Based on a wealth of published data [14, 15], the homozygous, nonessential deletion collection tends to reveal a similar set of genes involved in pathways required for resistance to/survival in multiple environmental conditions, whereas the heterozygous collection of all strains tends to be more specific, identifying essential proteins uniquely required for growth in a specific condition [13]. For the homozygous deletion collection, strains that were depleted from the pool specifically in spaceflight conditions are significantly enriched for genes in biological processes related to different aspects of RNA metabolism and catabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, regulation of ribosomal protein transcription, cytoplasmic RNA translation, rRNA processing, tRNA modification, and mRNA decay (Table 2, Figure 2, and Table S5). We also found that processes related to DNA integrity were required for survival in spaceflight. In particular, the linked processes of DNA repair and DNA recombination and replication as well as chromatin remodeling were all required for resistance to the effects of spaceflight. Finally, these DNA repair requirements extend to the mitochondria, which, by virtue of its small genome, is hypersensitive to DNA damage. Consistent with this, we found that genes required for both mitochondrial maintenance and proper protein localization to the mitochondria were enriched in the homozygous samples. Table 2.

Interestingly we have previously observed this phenomenon with a class of therapeutics that act as nucleotide analogs, such as 5-fluorouridine and fluorocytosine (described in detail below). Additionally, it is particularly noteworthy that, although we do see evidence of a requirement for RNA and DNA processing genes in spaceflight alone, the requirement is exacerbated when spaceflight is combined with the additional hyperosmotic stress imposed by the addition of 0.5 M NaCl (Table S6). We speculate that the added salt stress potentiates the DNA-damaging effects of spaceflight via the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ability of salt stress to induce ROS and subsequent DNA damage has been previously reported [26] and, in particular, the yeast mitochondria appears to be hypersensitive to this type of stress, consistent with its small genome being susceptible to the effects of DNA damage [27]. Furthermore, mitochondrial protein abundance has been shown to rapidly increase upon osmotic shock, and therefore the enrichment for mitochondrial protein localization we observe may reflect this requirement. To gain further insight into the pathways that modulate the response to both microgravity stress and combined spaceflight and salt stress, we used the GO enrichment profiles to query a database of over 3200 distinct drug treatments of the yeast deletion collections [13]. Specifically we quantified the similarity between the GO enrichments by computing the concordance of −log10(P) between any two profiles, where P measures the significance of enrichment of a single GO category. These concordance values are similar to Pearson correlation values; that is, values closer to one indicate greater similarity between profiles, except that high concordance also requires the scale of values to be similar between the profiles. When calculating concordance, we focused on GO biological process enrichment profiles (Table S7). One of the strong concordances was observed with 5-fluorouridine (0.42), an FDA-approved anticancer drug that is thought to also act by two mechanisms: (i) inhibiting thymidylate synthetase and (ii) through metabolism into cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA (Table 3) [14]. In addition to being incorporated in DNA and RNA, we and others have shown that the drug has been shown to inhibit the essential ribonuclease activity of the exosome complex [28]. Similarly, carmofur, a derivative of 5-fluorouracil, displays a concordance of 0.34. A similar concordance is seen with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), whose activity is identical to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Finally, 8-methoxypsoralen, a DNA-damaging agent that, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA, shows a congruence of 0.32. This compound causes the formation of both monofunctional (addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional adducts (crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA) that ultimately result in cell death.

Diallyl disulfide and related garlic derivatives have been shown to significantly increase the production of the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), which binds electrophilic toxins in the cell. Overloading the cell with inhibitory doses of diallyl disulfide reveals genes required for survival in the presence of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) [29]. In the case of the heterozygous collection, we found significant GO enrichments for the following categories: lipid metabolism, DNA catabolism, and regulation of translation and posttranslational modification (specifically protein phosphorylation) (Figure 3). As expected (based on previous studies of the heterozygous collection), both the number of genes associated with FDs and the number of enriched categories are considerably smaller than those derived from the homozygous collection [30]. This likely reflects two related phenomena: first, genes that when deleted in heterozygotes are sensitive to spaceflight encode proteins that participate in the pathways identified in the homozygous collection, where the fitness defect is stronger because the gene is completely absent. Second, none of these heterozygote strains encode a direct target of the perturbation. Interestingly, when we searched for drug profiles with high concordance with the spaceflight profiles derived from the heterozygous collection, we detected modest concordance with two human chemotherapeutics, mitoxantrone (concordance = 0.19), and Epirubicin (congruence 0.142). Both of these agents damage DNA by intercalating into the DNA double helix and also by stabilizing the cleavable complex that is the substrate of topoisomerase II [31–33].",

Results and Discussion Because we cannot distinguish the individual parameters that include flight, lack of gravity, and increased radiation, for the purposes of this paper, these are referred to collectively as “spaceflight” throughout the text.

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions The experiments presented here represent a proof of principle for conducting full genome environmental screens in spaceflight using robust hardware that can recapitulate a full automation suite with environmental control in the space of a small suitcase. The performance of this platform is significant for spaceflight studies and promises to enable terrestrial experiments in extreme environments that will have direct application to microbial bioprocessing for manufacturing, alternative fuel development, and basic research. The results from these experiments suggest that spaceflight has subtle but significant effects on core cellular processes including growth control via RNA and ribosomal biogenesis, metabolism, modification, and decay pathways. Furthermore, significant roles for DNA repair and replication, response to pH signaling, control of gene expression, and mitochondrial function were observed. The yeast chemogenetic analysis of spaceflight samples presented here strongly implicates DNA and RNA damage as the major ground-based analogs of spaceflight stress. Given the unique and substantial radiation exposure in space, this is consistent with major radiation-mediated effects. Unfortunately a 1 g control on ISS that might have allowed better discrimination between the contributions of space radiation versus the effects of microgravity on yeast responses was not available to us at this time. Current on-going experiments are designed explore these effects and dissect them from other potentially confounding variables. The high concordance to the profile induced by diallyl disulfide suggests increased glutathione S-transferase, binding of electrophilic toxins, increased reactive oxygen species, and change in redox state. These pathways, which are required for survival in spaceflight, can guide future experiments in two fundamental ways: firstly by suggesting environmental modifications that can bolster cellular and organismal integrity by avoiding further stress to these pathways, and secondly, by identifying drug stresses that can exacerbate these pathway requirements in an effort to control pathological cell growth in the case of proliferative diseases.",

Copyright notice ID: 4309212 PMID: 25667933 Abstract Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.1. Introduction Physical effects of microgravity during spaceflight can often be described by equations that allow their quantification [1, 2]. For example, microgravity has well-defined effects on sedimentation in association with reduced terminal velocity and shear in suspension culture [3] and reduced gravity-dependent convection of gases [4]. Biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are much harder to define [1, 2]. For example, spaceflight also entails radiation exposure, which has been studied in diverse systems but whose effects are not fully understood [5]. What is needed is a robust, unbiased, quantifiable system that is relevant for translation to ground-based applications and that is able to clearly distinguish spaceflight effects. It is our premise that yeast deletion collections are ideally suited for this type of analysis as yeast can be precisely controlled genetically and readily grown under spaceflight conditions. Biological responses of yeast strains during spaceflight can be quantified and compared to well-established databases of ground-based stressors and the comparisons can reveal features that are unique to microgravity as well as features that are shared with ground-based perturbations. While yeast cannot completely reflect the complexities of mammalian cells organized into tissues, the high degree of homology shared with human (~70% of all essential yeast genes have a significant human homolog) provides hypotheses for the mechanism of many responses of interest [6, 7]. Previous studies have attempted to identify, isolate, and offset the various physical factors changing during spaceflight to demonstrate their effects in an iterative fashion [8–10]. Earlier studies on the effects of space radiation on yeast failed to find any change in point mutation rates, DNA replication and/or repair, heritable damage, or colony morphology [5, 8, 11, 12]. However, those studies were limited by assay sensitivity. Here we applied the yeast deletion collection as a biological reporter to understand the metabolic pathways affecting survival during culture in spaceflight. In this fashion, we are able to make genome-wide comparisons and test for concordance against an extensive library of more than 3200 physical and pharmacological stressors [13]. Yeast is the first, and to date only, organism for which a complete, genome-wide knockdown collection is available. This collection is comprised of a genome-wide set of strains where each strain carries a precise deletion of a single gene [14]. Assembled over a four-year period by a consortium of 35 laboratories, this collection has been used by hundreds of laboratories to test thousands of different environmental stressors to define the genes required for survival in those conditions (see [15] for review). The molecular barcodes present in each strain allow the yeast deletion collection to be grown as a pool in the presence or absence of the stressor of interest after which the relative abundance of each strain is subsequently quantified [16]. Strains carrying a deletion of a gene required for survival in the presence of the stressor grow more slowly and thus exhibit a fitness defect reflected by their reduced abundance at the end of the culture period. In this manner, all genes required for growth can be readily identified in a single experiment, revealing the genes and associated pathways affected by the stressor. To identify the metabolic and genomic pathways affected by spaceflight, the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections were grown in spaceflight and ground control conditions, with and without hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second stressor. In spaceflight alone, the homozygous deletion collection revealed the importance of processes linked to mitochondria, while the heterozygous collection highlighted genes involved in regulating translation and ribosomal RNA transport. Both homozygous and heterozygous collections highlighted DNA repair. With the addition of NaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed the importance of RNA-related processes including ribosome assembly and biogenesis and mRNA processing and decay, as well as modification of tRNAs. Moreover, the NaCl addition highlighted replication processes more clearly (compared to the homozygous collection without NaCl), suggesting that spaceflight has measurable effects on these core and evolutionarily conserved processes. With the heterozygous collection, the addition of NaCl led to the identification of a nuclear pore organization gene, potentially providing additional insight into how RNA transport is affected by spaceflight. Taken together, the deletion collections identified several biological processes associated with spaceflight, and the additional hyperosmolar stress emphasized the importance of related processes. In a follow-up analysis, we queried the effects of spaceflight against a database of drug effects on yeast to search for those that are most concordant, thereby suggesting similar mechanisms of perturbation. Not only do the effects of spaceflight have relatively high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents, but also there is tight agreement amongst multiple therapeutic agents in this drug class, providing additional support for these findings.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Overall Design The Opticell Processing Module, described below, was used to perform a series of ~21 generation pooled growth experiments on two yeast deletion collections: (i) ~4800 homozygous strains and (ii) ~5900 heterozygous strains (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes), each carrying unique DNA barcodes that act as strain identifiers. Experiments were performed in both rich media and rich media supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl to assess the additional effect of osmotic stress on survival. The samples flew sortie on space shuttle mission STS-135 to the International Space Station (ISS). Parallel control experiments were performed in static 1G terrestrial controls in the Orbital Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center to match temperature, humidity, air composition, and volatile organic compounds. Ground controls were conducted in a 24-hour asynchronous fashion to allow matching of the experimental timelines on ISS as relayed through air-to-ground communication by the flight crew. At the end of the growth period, the fitness of each strain in each experimental pool was assessed as described [17]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, the barcodes in each pool were amplified by PCR, and the abundance of each barcode was quantified by next generation sequencing. A barcode count reflects the abundance of the corresponding strain at the end of the experiment, that is, a quantification of the relative requirement of the deleted gene for growth in the tested condition. In total, the experiment results in a count for each gene resulting in a gene list rank ordered by their importance for growth in the tested condition.2.2. Yeast Deletion Pool Construction The yeast deletion collections were stored as individual strains in YPD containing 7% DMSO at −80°C, in 96-well plates. The plates were thawed, mixed, and robotically pinned onto YPD agar plates as an array of 384 strains. After two days of growth at 30°C, colonies were consolidated (four plates of 384 to one plate of 1536 colonies) and robotically pinned in triplicate. Cells were grown in 30°C for 2-3 days until colonies formed. Slow growing strains were grown separately for 2-3 additional days. All plates were then flooded with 5–7 mL of media, scraped and pooled in YPD + 7% DMSO to a final concentration of OD600 = 0.84, and frozen at −80°C until use, as described [17].2.3. Construction of Opticell Culture System and Spaceflight Experiment In this study, we designed the Opticell Processing Module or OPM (Figure 1) that was capable of maintaining the yeast deletion collection as a pool grown in liquid culture for at least 20 generations in microgravity. The hardware comprised a liquid-sealed system of growth chambers (Opticells) that allowed for gas exchange across polystyrene membranes. Each OPM consisted of three Nunc Opticells held together with a common manifold and valve system that is autoclaved and attached with watertight O-ring seals. A 3 mL syringe connected to the manifold with a Luer fitting is used to transfer liquid between chambers and mix without breaking sterility and with minimal operator intervention. The valve on the manifold has four settings that connect the syringe to the following port locations 1: Off position, 2: Opticell A, 3: Opticell B, or 4: Opticell C. The OPM allows propagation of each deletion collection for a combined ~21 generations of growth when three chambers are used and the inoculum and transfer volumes are 0.5 mL. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The Opticell Processing Module (OPM) designed for propagation of each deletion collection for ~21 generations of growth. The OPM comprises three commercially available optically clear chambers (Opticells, Nunc) that are joined by a manifold and scaffold that can be autoclaved and assembled rapidly. The manifold contains a multiway valve unit which mates to each Opticell or to an the off position using O-ring seals. The opposite side of the valve contains a Luer fitting into which a standard 3cc syringe is attached. To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers is filled with 7 mL of sterile growth media. Deletion pools are loaded into the inoculation syringe and then injected into Chamber A of the OPM, precooled to 4°C. Growth is initiated by warming the unit to 30°C. After 16–24 h, 0.5 mL is removed from Chamber A and injected and mixed into Chamber B using the same syringe. This is repeated to continue multigenerational growth in Chamber C.To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers was prefilled with 7 mL of sterile growth media. Deletion collection aliquots were preloaded into each syringe and shipped to Kennedy Space Center, frozen in media containing 7% DMSO (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. During final integration at Kennedy Space Center, the OPMs were prechilled to 4°C. Each deletion collection aliquot was thawed, attached to an OPM manifold, injected, and mixed into chamber A. Cultures were maintained at 4°C and flown to the International Space Station (ISS). The growth experiment was initiated on orbit by warming the OPMs to 30°C. After 16–24 h at 30°C, a 0.5 mL sample was removed from chamber A using the same syringe and inoculated into chamber B. The process was repeated 16–24 hours later to inoculate 0.5 mL of sample from chamber B into chamber C. After an additional 16–24 hours, the OPMs were cooled back down to 4°C to greatly reduce any further growth and preserve the samples for return to Earth and postflight analysis. Exponential yeast growth leads to early depletion of growth media nutrients and significant retardation of further growth well before 16–24 hours. Growth is limited by media volume and strain distribution within the yeast deletion library reaches a steady state within that Opticell.2.4. Next Generation Sequencing The flight samples that returned from the ISS were handled in parallel with the ground control set. The OPM was disassembled into its three Opticells, and the entire contents were transferred to a storage tube using a blunt needle connected to a 20 mL syringe. One mL of each sample (at a final OD600 of 1.0-2.0) was processed to extract genomic DNA. Purified deletion pool DNA was amplified in two separate PCR reactions as described [17] and the amplicons purified prior to sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Each purified amplicon library was sequenced to a minimum depth of 500 counts/strain/sample as described [18]. Duplicate experiments were performed for all conditions, to ensure that at least one complete time course was collected for each pool (heterozygote and homozygote) and each condition. Due to failures in sample processing, several time points were not recovered or did not meet our in-house quality metrics (e.g., if sequence counts/strain were below threshold values). Accordingly, we focused on evaluating each experimental condition using singleton data as described in Table 1. Table 1. Experimental samples collected and available for analysis.

Data Analysis All computational analyses were performed using R [19] unless otherwise indicated. 2.5.1. Normalization of Sequence Counts Sequence counts for each strain in each experiment were quantified and normalized according to [18]. Briefly, each 20-mer barcode was amplified with primers comprised of the common barcode primers in addition to the sequences required for cluster formation on the Illumina flow cell. For multiplexed Illumina sequencing, 5-mer tag sequences were incorporated into each primer between the Illumina and barcode primer sequences. This multiplexing tag allowed postsequencing assignment of each amplicon to a particular experiment. Results for the 7-generation time point of the heterozygous deletion pool grown in spaceflight without NaCl did not pass our quality control and, consequently, that time point was omitted from analyses of the heterozygous pool without NaCl. All other counts were mean-normalized between experiments such that each experiment had the same mean count. We added ten pseudocounts to all sequence tag tallies (and, thus, all subsequent gene tallies) to prevent division by zero during data analyses (see Table S1 and Table S2 for mean normalized counts in Supplementary Materials available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/976458).2.5.2. Barcode Selection for Each Strain For each strain, we used signal from only the upstream or the downstream barcode (relative to the deletion site). First, we assumed that barcode counts close to zero represent background noise (e.g., possibly due to incorrect mapping of reads to barcodes). We thus selected a background threshold (bgThreshold = 100; see Parameter Selection), assuming that counts below it do not accurately reflect strain abundance. Then, for each time course, we filtered out barcodes where the average (normalized) count for the first 14 generations (the earliest time point with usable data in all experiments) was below bgThreshold. This filtering removed all barcodes for ~650–3200 strains (depending on the time course), and these strains were omitted from subsequent analyses; see Supplementary Tables S3 (homozygous strains) and S4 (heterozygous strains). For time courses that only had two time points (and thus an inefficient number to compute fits), strains that still had two barcodes after filtering were represented by their upstream barcodes due to their overall better behavior observed in a previous study [20]. For other time courses, linear fits (with and without the time logged) were computed for each remaining barcode. We defined the best fit as the fit with the lowest residual sum of squares (RSS) and used the F-test to compute a P value estimating the significance with which the fitted model is better than the null model (of a flat line at the average count value). The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to correct the P for multiple comparisons and generate FDR values [21]. Strains with two remaining barcodes were represented by the barcode with the higher R 2 (a measure of the amount of variation in the data explained by the fitted model), because they manifest less noise and better fit the data.2.5.3. Parameter Selection The selected normalization method (tested mean and quartile normalization) and bgThreshold (tested 50, 100, and 150) is the combination that resulted in the most significant enrichment of slow growing strains identified in the heterozygous deletion pool, sampled every two generations for 20 generations (data not shown), with slow growers identified in a previous study [22]. Briefly, we defined slow growers as those exhibiting sizable decreases in abundance over time. The significance of the decrease was estimated with FDR values (see Barcode Selection for Each Strain), and the magnitude was estimated with ΔAUC = (〈area under the growth curve〉 − 〈area under the flat growth curve〉)/(t max⁡ − t 0), where the flat growth curve is fixed at the t 0 abundance level, and the area under a curve is estimated using the trapezoid method. Also, if at some time point the abundance of a strain is less than or equal to bgThreshold and remains at negligible levels for the rest of the time course, we identified the strain as slow growing.2.5.4. Identification of Significant Fitness Defects in Time Point Comparisons To identify strains that exhibited significant fitness defects at a later time point (14 or 21 generations) compared to the first time point (7 generations), normalized counts less than bgThreshold were first forced to equal bgThreshold. Then, for each strain, we computed log2ratio = log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G) where abundanceyG is the count of the strain at y generations. For a given time point, robust Z scores were computed from the set of log2ratios; for example, Z i = (log⁡2ratioi − 〈log⁡2ratio median〉)/〈log⁡2ratio MAD〉 for strain i. Each Z i was then used to obtain P i from the standard normal distribution, and we assume that strains with low P values are outliers in the distribution of log2ratios. Moreover, strains with counts above bgThreshold at the first time point and counts equivalent to bgThreshold at the later time point of interest are defined as having dropped out. Taken together, we define strains with significant fitness defects at a specific time point as strains with log2ratio ≥ 1 and P ≤ 0.001 and/or strains that dropped out (Table S5, Table S6).2.5.5. Spaceflight versus Ground Comparisons For comparisons involving specific time points, we identified the set of strains that exhibited significant fitness defects (relative to the first time point) in the flight condition but not in the ground condition. This set is then further restricted to the set of strains with useable data in both conditions.2.5.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis We obtained gene ontology (GO) annotations of yeast genes from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (downloaded on May 26, 2012). GO biological processes that were too specific (containing less than five genes) or too general (containing greater than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis. Given a query set of genes (e.g., genes deleted from a set of (flight-ground) strains), we used the hypergeometric test to obtain a P value estimating the significance with which the set is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process, relative to a gene universe defined as the set of genes with usable data for both flight and ground conditions. Due to a limited number of significantly enriched processes following correction for multiple comparisons (FDR ≤ 0.1), here we report significantly enriched processes prior to the correction (P ≤ 0.01). We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps shown in Figures 2 and 3 that were generated using an approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin v1.1 [23, 24]. In contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each map were clustered with MCL (inflation = 2), using the overlap coefficient computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefficients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes in the same cluster were assigned the same node color, and a cluster label was determined based on common themes in the processes within the cluster. Moreover, the size of a node was made to be proportional to the significance with which the corresponding process is enriched [−log10(P)]. Each bar plot summarizes the genes that contribute the most to the enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot border. Specifically, a plot shows the flight-associated genes that are annotated to the largest number of relevant processes (if more than 10 genes, only the top 10 are shown). For each gene, the bar length is proportional to a fitness defect measure (i.e., log2ratio). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with flight-specific fitness defects at different time points in the homozygous deletion series. Each node represents a significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test P ≤ 0.01). A circle node indicates enrichment at 14 generations compared to 7 generations (the first time point), a square node indicates enrichment at 21 generations compared to 7 generations, and a diamond node indicates enrichment at both 14 generations and 21 generations (see Methods). Node size is proportional to the significance of enrichment [−log10(P)]. Node color indicates processes that share genes (see Methods) and summary labels are shown for nodes of the same color. Edges indicate ≥ 50% gene overlap between connected processes; width is proportional to the degree of overlap. Each bar plot provides fitness defect (FD) scores for genes that contribute to the enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot border. Specifically, the length of a bar is proportional to the log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G), where abundanceyG represents the abundance of the corresponding gene deletion strain at y generations (see Methods). An “x” on the bar indicates that the abundance of the strain lowers to background level at later time point.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with flight-specific fitness defects in the presence of NaCl, at different time points in heterozygous deletion samples. Each node represents a significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test P ≤ 0.01). Nodes, edges, and plots are as specified for Figure 2.The enrichment maps also combine two sets of enrichment results, with the processes enriched in one set shown with circle nodes, the processes enriched in the second set shown with square nodes, and the processes enriched in both sets shown with diamond nodes.2.5.7. Similarity between Flight-Associated Genes and Compound-Associated Genes We previously treated pools of yeast deletion strains with ~3200 compounds separately [13]. Each compound was subsequently associated with a set of genes deleted from strains that exhibited significant fitness defects induced by the compound. Like sets of flight-associated genes in this study, sets of compound-associated genes were assessed for enrichment of genes annotated to specific biological processes (as described above), resulting in an “enrichment profile” for each condition of interest. In each profile, each process is associated with a P measuring the significance of enrichment. Similarity between a pair of enrichment profiles was computed by concordance of −log10(P) across all processes common to both profiles, where concordance is like Pearson correlation except that scale is not ignored. Compounds with enrichment profiles that are most similar to a given flight enrichment profile may induce cellular responses that are most similar to the response induced by flight.3. Results and Discussion Because we cannot distinguish the individual parameters that include flight, lack of gravity, and increased radiation, for the purposes of this paper, these are referred to collectively as “spaceflight” throughout the text. To measure the effects of spaceflight on the rate of yeast growth in the Opticell, we inoculated 0.5 mL of a yeast deletion pool into 7 mL of YPD, resulting in a starting OD600 of ~0.06/mL and incubated at 30°C. Following growth for ~24 hr (~7 generations), 0.5 mL of the saturated culture was inoculated into the second chamber. This process was repeated for the final growth phase in the third chamber. Population doubling time was ~100 min in microgravity compared to ~90 min in ground-based controls. Each sample was grown for seven generations/Opticell for a total of 21 generations (Table 1). Doubling times were back-calculated using the OD600 of the samples collected at each time point. The morphology of Opticell-grown yeast in spaceflight was indistinguishable from static controls when observed by light microscopy; for example, budding pattern, overall shape, and size were not detectably different in the two conditions. On scanning electron microscopy, there were budding polarity and ruffling changes in every field, but there were no consistent differences (data not shown). We assessed the yeast deletion collection samples for patterns of strain sensitivity in the following manner: barcode counts for each strain in each sample were measured and normalized as described in Methods. The counts were used to rank each strain in each sample in order of their importance for growth. Four different samples were available from both spaceflight and ground cultures: (1) homozygous deletion collection in YPD, (2) homozygous deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5 M NaCl, (3) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD, and (4) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5 M NaCl. Each culture was sampled at three different time points, 7 generations, 14 generations, and 21 generations, and shown in Table 1. Samples from ground controls were compared to the corresponding samples grown in microgravity on the ISS. We analyzed changes in strain abundance by comparing each time point to a later time point. Using this approach allowed us to capture those strains that became depleted in any seven-generation interval. Strains with sizable decreases in measured abundance or with abundances that drop to background levels (and remain there) were identified as exhibiting fitness defects (FDs). Moreover, strains with flight-specific FDs were identified by subtracting the strains with FDs in the ground condition. For the purposes of our gene ontology (GO; http://amigo.geneontology.org) enrichment analysis, we considered the homozygous and heterozygous data separately. Based on a wealth of published data [14, 15], the homozygous, nonessential deletion collection tends to reveal a similar set of genes involved in pathways required for resistance to/survival in multiple environmental conditions, whereas the heterozygous collection of all strains tends to be more specific, identifying essential proteins uniquely required for growth in a specific condition [13]. For the homozygous deletion collection, strains that were depleted from the pool specifically in spaceflight conditions are significantly enriched for genes in biological processes related to different aspects of RNA metabolism and catabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, regulation of ribosomal protein transcription, cytoplasmic RNA translation, rRNA processing, tRNA modification, and mRNA decay (Table 2, Figure 2, and Table S5). We also found that processes related to DNA integrity were required for survival in spaceflight. In particular, the linked processes of DNA repair and DNA recombination and replication as well as chromatin remodeling were all required for resistance to the effects of spaceflight. Finally, these DNA repair requirements extend to the mitochondria, which, by virtue of its small genome, is hypersensitive to DNA damage. Consistent with this, we found that genes required for both mitochondrial maintenance and proper protein localization to the mitochondria were enriched in the homozygous samples. Table 2. Effects of spaceflight on yeast genome responses identified with the homozygous deletion series. General pathway GO biological process RNA metabolism and catabolism (i) Ribosome biogenesis(ii) Regulation of ribosomal protein transcription(iii) Cytoplasmic RNA translation(iv) rRNA processing(v) tRNA modification(vi) mRNA decay DNA integrity (i) DNA repair(ii) Recombination and replication(iii) Chromatin remodeling(iv) Mitochondrial maintenance(v) Proper protein localization to the mitochondria Open in a new tabThe enrichment of these particular processes is consistent with a general induction of DNA damage, which, in turn, perturbs RNA biogenesis [25]. Interestingly we have previously observed this phenomenon with a class of therapeutics that act as nucleotide analogs, such as 5-fluorouridine and fluorocytosine (described in detail below). Additionally, it is particularly noteworthy that, although we do see evidence of a requirement for RNA and DNA processing genes in spaceflight alone, the requirement is exacerbated when spaceflight is combined with the additional hyperosmotic stress imposed by the addition of 0.5 M NaCl (Table S6). We speculate that the added salt stress potentiates the DNA-damaging effects of spaceflight via the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ability of salt stress to induce ROS and subsequent DNA damage has been previously reported [26] and, in particular, the yeast mitochondria appears to be hypersensitive to this type of stress, consistent with its small genome being susceptible to the effects of DNA damage [27]. Furthermore, mitochondrial protein abundance has been shown to rapidly increase upon osmotic shock, and therefore the enrichment for mitochondrial protein localization we observe may reflect this requirement. To gain further insight into the pathways that modulate the response to both microgravity stress and combined spaceflight and salt stress, we used the GO enrichment profiles to query a database of over 3200 distinct drug treatments of the yeast deletion collections [13]. Specifically we quantified the similarity between the GO enrichments by computing the concordance of −log10(P) between any two profiles, where P measures the significance of enrichment of a single GO category. These concordance values are similar to Pearson correlation values; that is, values closer to one indicate greater similarity between profiles, except that high concordance also requires the scale of values to be similar between the profiles. When calculating concordance, we focused on GO biological process enrichment profiles (Table S7). One of the strong concordances was observed with 5-fluorouridine (0.42), an FDA-approved anticancer drug that is thought to also act by two mechanisms: (i) inhibiting thymidylate synthetase and (ii) through metabolism into cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA (Table 3) [14]. In addition to being incorporated in DNA and RNA, we and others have shown that the drug has been shown to inhibit the essential ribonuclease activity of the exosome complex [28]. Similarly, carmofur, a derivative of 5-fluorouracil, displays a concordance of 0.34. A similar concordance is seen with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), whose activity is identical to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Finally, 8-methoxypsoralen, a DNA-damaging agent that, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA, shows a congruence of 0.32. This compound causes the formation of both monofunctional (addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional adducts (crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA) that ultimately result in cell death. Table 3. Concordance between drug effects and spaceflight effects on yeast genome responses identified with the homozygous deletion series (+NaCl). Drug (concordance) Biological function 5-Fluorouridine (0.42)5-Fluorouracil (0.36)Carmofur (0.34)5-Fluorocytosine (0.35) Pyrimidine analogs that inhibit thymidylate synthase and are metabolized into cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA 8-Methoxypsoralen (0.32) DNA-damaging agent Diallyl disulfide (0.4) Increased glutathione-S-transferase changes redox state by binding electrophilic toxins Open in a new tabWe also found high concordance to the diallyl disulfide profile (0.40), an agent that has been demonstrated to be efficient for detoxification of a variety of cells. Diallyl disulfide and related garlic derivatives have been shown to significantly increase the production of the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), which binds electrophilic toxins in the cell. Overloading the cell with inhibitory doses of diallyl disulfide reveals genes required for survival in the presence of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) [29]. In the case of the heterozygous collection, we found significant GO enrichments for the following categories: lipid metabolism, DNA catabolism, and regulation of translation and posttranslational modification (specifically protein phosphorylation) (Figure 3). As expected (based on previous studies of the heterozygous collection), both the number of genes associated with FDs and the number of enriched categories are considerably smaller than those derived from the homozygous collection [30]. This likely reflects two related phenomena: first, genes that when deleted in heterozygotes are sensitive to spaceflight encode proteins that participate in the pathways identified in the homozygous collection, where the fitness defect is stronger because the gene is completely absent. Second, none of these heterozygote strains encode a direct target of the perturbation. Interestingly, when we searched for drug profiles with high concordance with the spaceflight profiles derived from the heterozygous collection, we detected modest concordance with two human chemotherapeutics, mitoxantrone (concordance = 0.19), and Epirubicin (congruence 0.142). Both of these agents damage DNA by intercalating into the DNA double helix and also by stabilizing the cleavable complex that is the substrate of topoisomerase II [31–33].4. Conclusions The experiments presented here represent a proof of principle for conducting full genome environmental screens in spaceflight using robust hardware that can recapitulate a full automation suite with environmental control in the space of a small suitcase. The performance of this platform is significant for spaceflight studies and promises to enable terrestrial experiments in extreme environments that will have direct application to microbial bioprocessing for manufacturing, alternative fuel development, and basic research. The results from these experiments suggest that spaceflight has subtle but significant effects on core cellular processes including growth control via RNA and ribosomal biogenesis, metabolism, modification, and decay pathways. Furthermore, significant roles for DNA repair and replication, response to pH signaling, control of gene expression, and mitochondrial function were observed. The yeast chemogenetic analysis of spaceflight samples presented here strongly implicates DNA and RNA damage as the major ground-based analogs of spaceflight stress. Given the unique and substantial radiation exposure in space, this is consistent with major radiation-mediated effects. Unfortunately a 1 g control on ISS that might have allowed better discrimination between the contributions of space radiation versus the effects of microgravity on yeast responses was not available to us at this time. Current on-going experiments are designed explore these effects and dissect them from other potentially confounding variables. The high concordance to the profile induced by diallyl disulfide suggests increased glutathione S-transferase, binding of electrophilic toxins, increased reactive oxygen species, and change in redox state. These pathways, which are required for survival in spaceflight, can guide future experiments in two fundamental ways: firstly by suggesting environmental modifications that can bolster cellular and organismal integrity by avoiding further stress to these pathways, and secondly, by identifying drug stresses that can exacerbate these pathway requirements in an effort to control pathological cell growth in the case of proliferative diseases.Supplementary Material Supplementary tables 1 and 2 provide the Illumina sequencing counts for each barcode/strain of each sample following mean normalization for the homozygous strains (Supplementary Table S1) and the heterozygous deletion strains (Supplementary Table S2).

    "abstract": "Abstract Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.

    "introduction": "Introduction The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al. 2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al. 2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al. 2009a, 2010, 2012a, d). Yeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz 1979) and phenotype [e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al. 2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a). Little is known about the effects of spaceflight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process. To answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (e.g. spaceflight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond and Hammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014; Birdsall et al. 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al. 2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017). Metabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media. Three major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1 lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al. 2012a, d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in spaceflight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004). Table 1. Clones selected for study Standard name Systematic name Description Reason for selection ATO3 YDR384C Putative ammonium transporter Upregulated in the upper cells of giant yeast colonies INO1 YJL153C Inositol-3-phosphate synthase Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies TRR1 YDR353W ThioRedoxin Reductase Key control enzyme in redox which is altered in spaceflight BEM1 YBR200W Involved in budding Bud scarring is altered in spaceflight in liquid cultures EDC3 YEL015W Enhancer of mRNA DeCapping Constitutive control RPL34B YIL052C Stress response gene Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; Dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid cultures SSA4 YER103W Stress response gene Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid cultures Sfp1 YLR403W Stress-responsive transcriptional regulator Differential effect on SSA4 and RPL34B in microgravity vs ground-based liquid cultures Msn4 YKL062W Stress-responsive transcriptional regulator Differential effect on SSA4 and RPL34B in microgravity ground-based liquid cultures Open in a new tab Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters, Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during spaceflight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al. 2008a). Third, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al. 2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known. We have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of spaceflight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation.",
    "methods": "Methods and Materials Chemicals and Reagents Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (i.e., wild type (WT)), was used to match our earlier studies (Hammond et al. 2015). This parental strain, as well as Msn4 deletion, Sfp1 deletion, BEM1-eGFP and TRR1-eGFP yeast clones were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). FITC-VAD-fmk was purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). FITC Annexin V was purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc. (Mountain View, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Media consisted of “rich” YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose (D-glucose)) or “poor” YE (1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 1% ethanol, and 10 mM CaCl2) (Birdsall et al. 2016). 2% agar was added to YPD or YE for solid phase cultures. Construction of Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) Expression Clones Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to direct integrate genomic of DNA coding for and in-frame GFP epitope tag at the C-terminus of selected open reading frames (ORFs) in the yeast genome as described previously (Howson et al. 2005) and https://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org/.Giant Yeast Colony Cultures: Static, Rotating Random Positioning Machine and Spaceflight 100 μ l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30∘C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 μ l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots per plate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc™ bags. The plates were cooled to 4∘C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each set contained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YE agar. Figure 1 summarizes the matrix of experiments performed. Flight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc™ bag and stacks of eight were placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs; http://www-bioserve.colorado.edu/tech_Sheets_pdfs/SelectBioServeHardware.pdf; BioServe Space Technologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allows for gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. (https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/life_support_systems/crew_payload/index.html). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4∘C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al. 2004) that was set to 30 ∘C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to + 4 ∘C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Four conditions were studied: Spaceflight and three forms of ground controls: static, rotating, and randomly positioned. Approximately two days post-launch, the plates on the ISS were warmed to 30 ∘C to initiate yeast growth. After 28 days inflight, the plates were chilled and returned to Earth. Static ground controls were oriented with the agar surface facing upwards. For rotation studies, plates were securely taped to the front of the rotating wall vessel head so that the plates were perpendicular to the floor. For random positioning, plates were secured to the platform of a Desktop Random Positioning MachineThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flight samples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples. A third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall-Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grown at ambient laboratory conditions (25 ∘C) rather than 30 ∘C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls were maintained in plastic bags at 25∘C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs/30 ∘C versus no-PHAB/25 ∘C, did not differ (Pearson correlation > 95%) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect any differences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation > 95%). Static controls were incubated with the agar facing upwards. For rotation studies, four stacked Omniwell plates in plastic bags were securely taped to the front of the rotator head (Synthecon, Houston TX) oriented with the surface of the agar perpendicular to the floor (see Fig. 1). Plates were spun at 12 rpm in a direction co-planar with the surface of the agar around an axis of rotation at the center plate. Replicate colonies of each clone were spotted in 4 to 6 sites on the agar and located 10 to 75 mm from the axis of rotation. For random positioning, four Omniwell plates were taped to the baseplate of a Desktop Random Positioning Machine (Dutch Space, Leiden, The Netherlands), set to simulated 0 g during 3-D vector-averaging random positioning. The colonies on the agar surfaces were approximately 70mm, 55 mm, 40 mm, and 25 mm from the rotation axis. The stack was continuously re-positioned with random direction and speed to achieve a net zero gravity vector. Maximum acceleration/deceleration was 161 degrees/sec2, maximum input frame speed was 45 degrees/sec, and positioning speed was 45 degrees/sec. This data meets the Bonn Criteria (Hammond and Allen 2011). Flight, rotation, and RPM growth conditions had four replicates on the parental strains and six replicates for the deletion strains. Static cultures had eight replicates for the flight, rotation, and RPM conditions and 12 replicates for the static cultures.Assays for shear stress gene expression, cell death, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species All assays were performed by flow cytometry. Our probes for viability, GFP expression, and yeast redox levels have been validated previously (Birdsall et al. 2016). The choice of parameters to assay were based on the importance of the effects of shear stress promoters, reactive oxygen species, and cell death in giant yeast colonies. On the day of each assay, giant yeast colonies were removed from the agar plate with a plastic tissue culture loop, placed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and suspended by vortex. 50 μ l aliquots of yeast in PBS were placed in 5ml tubes preloaded with 300 μ l of propidium iodide (PI) at 1 μ g/ml solution to measure viability, or 300 μ l of dihydroethidium (DHE) at 5 μ g/ml to measure reactive oxygen. To measure caspase yeast were washed once in PBS, pelleted, incubated for 20 min at 28 ∘C in 200 μ l of 10 μ M FITC-VAD-fmk, and then washed once in PBS. To measure annexin, yeast were washed in sorbitol buffer (1.2M sorbitol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 35 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), digested for 30 min at 28 ∘C with 5.5% glusuase and 15 Um/ml lyticase in sorbitol buffer, and washed twice in kit binding buffer to which 1.2 M sorbitol is added. Yeast were resuspended in 100 μ l binding buffer with sorbitol and stained with 5 μ l of annexin and 1 μ l of PI at 0.1 mg/ml in binding buffer with sorbitol for 15 min at room temperature for 15 min. 400 μ l binding buffer with sorbitol was added and the samples were maintained on ice until analyzed Positive controls for the PI, DHE, annexin binding, and caspase assays were generated by heating yeast to 40 ∘C for three minutes and by exposing yeast to 120 mM acetic acid for five minutes. Negative controls were generated using liquid yeast cultures in log phase growth. Flow cytometry of PI-stained cells revealed three peaks - high uptake, low uptake, and negative uptake. Cell death was identified as high PI uptake (Lin et al. 2008). Cell apoptosis was identified as low uptake of PI and positive staining with annexin V, and expression of related caspases was identified with FITC-VAD-FMK (Qi et al. 2003. CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK In Situ Marker (Promega Corporation, Madison WI) is a fluorescent analog of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone) (Qi et al. 2003). The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) group has been substituted for the carbobenzoxy (Z) N-terminal blocking group to create a fluorescent apoptosis marker. This structure allows delivery of the inhibitor into the cell where it irreversibly binds to activated caspases. Flow cytometry was performed in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute Research Flow Cytometry Shared Resource Facility under the direction of Dr. Gregory D. Sempowski (Durham, NC). Flow cytometric studies were carried on a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) LSRII cell analyzer flow cytometer using Excitation/Emission of 510/580nm, 532/610nm, and 488/530 nm for DHE, PI, and GFP/ CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK/annexin, respectively. The instrument was aligned using fluorescent beads. Yeast cell gating was established using a display of log side scatter fluorescence verses linear forward scatter, using glutaraldehyde stained pan fluorescent controls for confirmation in fluorescent channels. Unstained yeast samples were used to determine levels of background fluorescence Measurements were collected on at least 10,000 cells per sample. Statistics Flow cytometry data is presented as geometric mean ±standard error of the mean of fluorescence in arbitrary units compared to a negative control with a minimum of six replicates. Geometric means were determined using FlowJo Software (Ashland, OR). Analysis of variance and post-hoc comparison using Tukey’s test was performed using Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK), using correlation matrix product moment and partial correlations. Flow cytometry data was also analyzed statistically using Kolgomorov-Smirnov summation statistics (Young 1977). Specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for the data in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are tabulated in Tables 2, 3, and 4. Fig. 2.

    "results": "Results Expression of the stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, was measured using eGFP fusion protein expression clones. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing the eGFP signal of the parent strains to clones in which the Msn4 or Sfp1 promoter genes had been deleted (Fig. 2 and Table 2). In summary, in colonies grown on rich YPD media, SSA4 increased compared to static culture in all culture modalities. The increases in SSA4 expression seen in flight and rotation, but not random positioning, were Sfp1 dependent. RPL34B gene expression did not change during any culture condition on YPD. Flight and rotation had oppositely directed RPL34B gene expression changes dependent on Msn4. Colonies grown on nutrient poor YE media yielded gene expression changes distinct from those seen in nutrient rich YPD media. SSA4 expression increased in flight and was Sfp1dependent. Ssa4 expression did not change during rotation and decreased during random positioning. In both rotation and random positioning, expression of SSA4 was dependent on both Msn4 and Sfp1. On YE media, RPL34B increased in flight with Msn4 dependence, but did not change during rotation or random positioning. Expression of ATO3, INO1, TRR1, BEM1 and EDC3 is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. Expression of SSA4 and RPL34B is shown in Fig. 2, as noted above. Expression of the EDC3 gene did not change expression during any culture modality, demonstrating that we are not observing a field change. Expression of three genes, INO1, TRR1, and SSA4, changed in flight on both YPD and YE. In flight, expression of RPL34B increased on YE but not YPD, while expression of BEM1 was the reverse, changing in increasing in YPD but not YE. The only other change in INO1 was a decreased expression on YE during rotation. Expression of TRR1 had no other changes. Expression of SSA4 also decreased during random positioning on YE, and increased on YPD during rotation and random positioning. Expression of BEM1 did not change on YE, but increased on YPD with flight, rotation and random positioning. ATO3 expression, which did not change in flight, had no changes on YE, but increased on YPD under both rotation and random positioning growth conditions. Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis (as measured by PI and Annexin V staining) was affected by the culture modalities and manifested diverse stress defense promoter dependence (Fig. 4 and Table 4). In summary, in flight cell necrosis had no baseline changes but showed dramatic Sfp1 and Msn4 dependence only on YE. Necrosis was reduced on YE during both rotation and random positioning dependent on both Sfp1 and Msn4. Basal necrosis rates were decreased and dependence on Sfp1 during rotation, and on Msn4 during both rotation and random positioning. In flight, apoptosis was reduced only on YE, and on YPD basal apoptosis was both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent. During rotation basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent only on YE. During random positioning basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent on both YE and YPD. Changes in Annexin V exposure and caspase activity (indicative of apoptosis) were consistent with the changes in the middle peak of propidium iodide stained cells (e.g. low PI uptake) observed by flow cytometry. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4. As controls, assay of fresh wild type cells was no different to unstained cells for annexin binding but showed caspase expression providing a negative control baseline (data not shown). Treatment with acetic acid or heat induced both caspase activity and annexin binding providing positive controls (data not shown). Annexin only changed from static controls during rotation on YE, and on YPD only in flight. Stress defense promoter dependence was not tested. Caspase only changed from static controls during flight on YE, and on YPD only during rotation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, especially superoxide formation, was monitored with DHE. Positive control cells were induced with acetic acid and heat (data not shown). On YE, none of the culture techniques changed DHE signal, but basal levels were Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4. On YPD, DHE signal was increased in flight, independent of the stress defense promoters. Rotation and random positioning did not change DHE levels, but basal levels were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent under these culture conditions.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Systematic studies of the effects of true microgravity and common microgravity simulations on cell physiology has been lacking. Furthermore, how these environments combine with other fundamental variables such as growth media to influence the cellular response to stress is an outstanding question. We address both of these by examining cellular changes, including gene expression (reported by shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1), reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. The current studies define a role of ammonia signaling and stress pathways using physical methods to disrupt ammonia convection in giant yeast colonies. Several lines of evidence support increased ammonia signaling during the near total lack of convection during colony culture in microgravity. First, of all the models tested, microgravity was the only one to increase both select reactive oxygen species and stress defense genes. These genes include inositol-3-phosphate synthase (INO1), thioredoxin reductase (TRR1), and stress seventy subfamily A (SSA4). These changes were independent of media type. Interestingly, both INO1 and TRR1 are predominantly expressed in the L or lower colony cells when yeast colony stratify into feeder and growing layers in giant colonies (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). This suggests that ammonia signaling is increased when the generated ammonia cannot convect away from the colonies. Second, the increased expression of the stress defense dependent SSA4 gene is consistent with lack of oxygen availability and carbon dioxide accumulation as these gasses are also affected by the lack of convection. Third, expression of both SSA4 and RPL34B increased more in flight when the classic stress defense promoter Msn4 was deleted. Shear stress promoters have a complex interplay of effects on the expression of genes they modify (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002). Table 5 summarizes the effects of shear press promoters on expression of dependent genes during manipulation of physical forces from this report as well as previous studies. Even within just these two shear stress response genes (SSA4 and RPL34b), with and without deletion of shear stress promoters (Msn4 and Sfp1), there is scant commonality of the gene expression changes or promoter dependence. Interestingly, a similar signaling phenomenon was recently reported for bacteria, where acetate accumulation in the boundary layer affected metabolism, presumably likewise due to lack of convection in microgravity (Zea et al. 2016) and in E. coli where nutrient depletion in simulated microgravity induced stress response genes (Vukanti and Leff 2012).

Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012). The changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averaging and rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effects of true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al. 2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of spaceflight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs. We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models in both ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes, providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al. 2016; Frett et al. 2016) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al. 2017; van Loon 2008). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, spaceflight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and spaceflight had very similar effects. The ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a, d; Birdsall et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.",

Copyright notice ID: 6560652 PMID: 31258252 Abstract Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation. Keywords: Yeast, Microgravity, Reactive oxygen species, Spaceflight, Shear stress, Random positioning machine, ApoptosisIntroduction The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al. 2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al. 2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al. 2009a, 2010, 2012a, d). Yeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz 1979) and phenotype [e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al. 2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a). Little is known about the effects of spaceflight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process. To answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (e.g. spaceflight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond and Hammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014; Birdsall et al. 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al. 2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017). Metabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media. Three major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1 lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al. 2012a, d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in spaceflight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004). Table 1.

We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during spaceflight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al. 2008a). Third, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al. 2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known. We have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of spaceflight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation.Methods and Materials Chemicals and Reagents Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (i.e., wild type (WT)), was used to match our earlier studies (Hammond et al. 2015). This parental strain, as well as Msn4 deletion, Sfp1 deletion, BEM1-eGFP and TRR1-eGFP yeast clones were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). FITC-VAD-fmk was purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). FITC Annexin V was purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc. (Mountain View, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Media consisted of “rich” YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose (D-glucose)) or “poor” YE (1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 1% ethanol, and 10 mM CaCl2) (Birdsall et al. 2016). 2% agar was added to YPD or YE for solid phase cultures. Construction of Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) Expression Clones Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to direct integrate genomic of DNA coding for and in-frame GFP epitope tag at the C-terminus of selected open reading frames (ORFs) in the yeast genome as described previously (Howson et al. 2005) and https://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org/.Giant Yeast Colony Cultures: Static, Rotating Random Positioning Machine and Spaceflight 100 μ l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30∘C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 μ l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots per plate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc™ bags. The plates were cooled to 4∘C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each set contained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YE agar. Figure 1 summarizes the matrix of experiments performed. Flight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc™ bag and stacks of eight were placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs; http://www-bioserve.colorado.edu/tech_Sheets_pdfs/SelectBioServeHardware.pdf; BioServe Space Technologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allows for gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. (https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/life_support_systems/crew_payload/index.html). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4∘C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al. 2004) that was set to 30 ∘C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to + 4 ∘C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Four conditions were studied: Spaceflight and three forms of ground controls: static, rotating, and randomly positioned. Approximately two days post-launch, the plates on the ISS were warmed to 30 ∘C to initiate yeast growth. After 28 days inflight, the plates were chilled and returned to Earth. Static ground controls were oriented with the agar surface facing upwards. For rotation studies, plates were securely taped to the front of the rotating wall vessel head so that the plates were perpendicular to the floor. For random positioning, plates were secured to the platform of a Desktop Random Positioning MachineThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flight samples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples. A third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall-Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grown at ambient laboratory conditions (25 ∘C) rather than 30 ∘C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls were maintained in plastic bags at 25∘C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs/30 ∘C versus no-PHAB/25 ∘C, did not differ (Pearson correlation > 95%) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect any differences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation > 95%). Static controls were incubated with the agar facing upwards. For rotation studies, four stacked Omniwell plates in plastic bags were securely taped to the front of the rotator head (Synthecon, Houston TX) oriented with the surface of the agar perpendicular to the floor (see Fig. 1). Plates were spun at 12 rpm in a direction co-planar with the surface of the agar around an axis of rotation at the center plate. Replicate colonies of each clone were spotted in 4 to 6 sites on the agar and located 10 to 75 mm from the axis of rotation. For random positioning, four Omniwell plates were taped to the baseplate of a Desktop Random Positioning Machine (Dutch Space, Leiden, The Netherlands), set to simulated 0 g during 3-D vector-averaging random positioning. The colonies on the agar surfaces were approximately 70mm, 55 mm, 40 mm, and 25 mm from the rotation axis. The stack was continuously re-positioned with random direction and speed to achieve a net zero gravity vector. Maximum acceleration/deceleration was 161 degrees/sec2, maximum input frame speed was 45 degrees/sec, and positioning speed was 45 degrees/sec. This data meets the Bonn Criteria (Hammond and Allen 2011). Flight, rotation, and RPM growth conditions had four replicates on the parental strains and six replicates for the deletion strains. Static cultures had eight replicates for the flight, rotation, and RPM conditions and 12 replicates for the static cultures.Assays for shear stress gene expression, cell death, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species All assays were performed by flow cytometry. Our probes for viability, GFP expression, and yeast redox levels have been validated previously (Birdsall et al. 2016). The choice of parameters to assay were based on the importance of the effects of shear stress promoters, reactive oxygen species, and cell death in giant yeast colonies. On the day of each assay, giant yeast colonies were removed from the agar plate with a plastic tissue culture loop, placed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and suspended by vortex. 50 μ l aliquots of yeast in PBS were placed in 5ml tubes preloaded with 300 μ l of propidium iodide (PI) at 1 μ g/ml solution to measure viability, or 300 μ l of dihydroethidium (DHE) at 5 μ g/ml to measure reactive oxygen. To measure caspase yeast were washed once in PBS, pelleted, incubated for 20 min at 28 ∘C in 200 μ l of 10 μ M FITC-VAD-fmk, and then washed once in PBS. To measure annexin, yeast were washed in sorbitol buffer (1.2M sorbitol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 35 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), digested for 30 min at 28 ∘C with 5.5% glusuase and 15 Um/ml lyticase in sorbitol buffer, and washed twice in kit binding buffer to which 1.2 M sorbitol is added. Yeast were resuspended in 100 μ l binding buffer with sorbitol and stained with 5 μ l of annexin and 1 μ l of PI at 0.1 mg/ml in binding buffer with sorbitol for 15 min at room temperature for 15 min. 400 μ l binding buffer with sorbitol was added and the samples were maintained on ice until analyzed Positive controls for the PI, DHE, annexin binding, and caspase assays were generated by heating yeast to 40 ∘C for three minutes and by exposing yeast to 120 mM acetic acid for five minutes. Negative controls were generated using liquid yeast cultures in log phase growth. Flow cytometry of PI-stained cells revealed three peaks - high uptake, low uptake, and negative uptake. Cell death was identified as high PI uptake (Lin et al. 2008). Cell apoptosis was identified as low uptake of PI and positive staining with annexin V, and expression of related caspases was identified with FITC-VAD-FMK (Qi et al. 2003. CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK In Situ Marker (Promega Corporation, Madison WI) is a fluorescent analog of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone) (Qi et al. 2003). The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) group has been substituted for the carbobenzoxy (Z) N-terminal blocking group to create a fluorescent apoptosis marker. This structure allows delivery of the inhibitor into the cell where it irreversibly binds to activated caspases. Flow cytometry was performed in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute Research Flow Cytometry Shared Resource Facility under the direction of Dr. Gregory D. Sempowski (Durham, NC). Flow cytometric studies were carried on a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) LSRII cell analyzer flow cytometer using Excitation/Emission of 510/580nm, 532/610nm, and 488/530 nm for DHE, PI, and GFP/ CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK/annexin, respectively. The instrument was aligned using fluorescent beads. Yeast cell gating was established using a display of log side scatter fluorescence verses linear forward scatter, using glutaraldehyde stained pan fluorescent controls for confirmation in fluorescent channels. Unstained yeast samples were used to determine levels of background fluorescence Measurements were collected on at least 10,000 cells per sample.Statistics Flow cytometry data is presented as geometric mean ±standard error of the mean of fluorescence in arbitrary units compared to a negative control with a minimum of six replicates. Geometric means were determined using FlowJo Software (Ashland, OR). Analysis of variance and post-hoc comparison using Tukey’s test was performed using Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK), using correlation matrix product moment and partial correlations. Flow cytometry data was also analyzed statistically using Kolgomorov-Smirnov summation statistics (Young 1977). Specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for the data in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are tabulated in Tables 2, 3, and 4. Fig. 2.

Colonies were harvested after 28 days, dispersed in saline and analyzed by flow cytometry for uptake of PI. Data from SSA4 and RPL34B clones with no promoter deletion were pooled, data from SSA4 and RPL34B with Sfp1 deletions were pooled, and data from SSA4 and RPL34B with Msn4 deletions were pooled. PI uptake data are the % of yeast that were apoptotic (%low PI uptake) or dead (% high PI uptake) and error bars are the SEM of 8-24 replicates. SSA4 and RPL43B clones without promoter deletions were also assayed for ROS with DHE and for apoptosis by expression of caspase and binding of annexin. Data are the geomean channel fluorescence and error bars are the SEM of 8 replicates. p values are shown for ANOVA, followed by pairwise Tukey analyzes. ns - not significant, p > 0.05Results Expression of the stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, was measured using eGFP fusion protein expression clones. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing the eGFP signal of the parent strains to clones in which the Msn4 or Sfp1 promoter genes had been deleted (Fig. 2 and Table 2). In summary, in colonies grown on rich YPD media, SSA4 increased compared to static culture in all culture modalities. The increases in SSA4 expression seen in flight and rotation, but not random positioning, were Sfp1 dependent. RPL34B gene expression did not change during any culture condition on YPD. Flight and rotation had oppositely directed RPL34B gene expression changes dependent on Msn4. Colonies grown on nutrient poor YE media yielded gene expression changes distinct from those seen in nutrient rich YPD media. SSA4 expression increased in flight and was Sfp1dependent. Ssa4 expression did not change during rotation and decreased during random positioning. In both rotation and random positioning, expression of SSA4 was dependent on both Msn4 and Sfp1. On YE media, RPL34B increased in flight with Msn4 dependence, but did not change during rotation or random positioning. Expression of ATO3, INO1, TRR1, BEM1 and EDC3 is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. Expression of SSA4 and RPL34B is shown in Fig. 2, as noted above. Expression of the EDC3 gene did not change expression during any culture modality, demonstrating that we are not observing a field change. Expression of three genes, INO1, TRR1, and SSA4, changed in flight on both YPD and YE. In flight, expression of RPL34B increased on YE but not YPD, while expression of BEM1 was the reverse, changing in increasing in YPD but not YE. The only other change in INO1 was a decreased expression on YE during rotation. Expression of TRR1 had no other changes. Expression of SSA4 also decreased during random positioning on YE, and increased on YPD during rotation and random positioning. Expression of BEM1 did not change on YE, but increased on YPD with flight, rotation and random positioning. ATO3 expression, which did not change in flight, had no changes on YE, but increased on YPD under both rotation and random positioning growth conditions. Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis (as measured by PI and Annexin V staining) was affected by the culture modalities and manifested diverse stress defense promoter dependence (Fig. 4 and Table 4). In summary, in flight cell necrosis had no baseline changes but showed dramatic Sfp1 and Msn4 dependence only on YE. Necrosis was reduced on YE during both rotation and random positioning dependent on both Sfp1 and Msn4. Basal necrosis rates were decreased and dependence on Sfp1 during rotation, and on Msn4 during both rotation and random positioning. In flight, apoptosis was reduced only on YE, and on YPD basal apoptosis was both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent. During rotation basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent only on YE. During random positioning basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent on both YE and YPD. Changes in Annexin V exposure and caspase activity (indicative of apoptosis) were consistent with the changes in the middle peak of propidium iodide stained cells (e.g. low PI uptake) observed by flow cytometry. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4. As controls, assay of fresh wild type cells was no different to unstained cells for annexin binding but showed caspase expression providing a negative control baseline (data not shown). Treatment with acetic acid or heat induced both caspase activity and annexin binding providing positive controls (data not shown). Annexin only changed from static controls during rotation on YE, and on YPD only in flight. Stress defense promoter dependence was not tested. Caspase only changed from static controls during flight on YE, and on YPD only during rotation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, especially superoxide formation, was monitored with DHE. Positive control cells were induced with acetic acid and heat (data not shown). On YE, none of the culture techniques changed DHE signal, but basal levels were Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4. On YPD, DHE signal was increased in flight, independent of the stress defense promoters. Rotation and random positioning did not change DHE levels, but basal levels were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent under these culture conditions.Discussion Systematic studies of the effects of true microgravity and common microgravity simulations on cell physiology has been lacking. Furthermore, how these environments combine with other fundamental variables such as growth media to influence the cellular response to stress is an outstanding question. We address both of these by examining cellular changes, including gene expression (reported by shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1), reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. The current studies define a role of ammonia signaling and stress pathways using physical methods to disrupt ammonia convection in giant yeast colonies. Several lines of evidence support increased ammonia signaling during the near total lack of convection during colony culture in microgravity. First, of all the models tested, microgravity was the only one to increase both select reactive oxygen species and stress defense genes. These genes include inositol-3-phosphate synthase (INO1), thioredoxin reductase (TRR1), and stress seventy subfamily A (SSA4). These changes were independent of media type. Interestingly, both INO1 and TRR1 are predominantly expressed in the L or lower colony cells when yeast colony stratify into feeder and growing layers in giant colonies (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). This suggests that ammonia signaling is increased when the generated ammonia cannot convect away from the colonies. Second, the increased expression of the stress defense dependent SSA4 gene is consistent with lack of oxygen availability and carbon dioxide accumulation as these gasses are also affected by the lack of convection. Third, expression of both SSA4 and RPL34B increased more in flight when the classic stress defense promoter Msn4 was deleted. Shear stress promoters have a complex interplay of effects on the expression of genes they modify (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002). Table 5 summarizes the effects of shear press promoters on expression of dependent genes during manipulation of physical forces from this report as well as previous studies. Even within just these two shear stress response genes (SSA4 and RPL34b), with and without deletion of shear stress promoters (Msn4 and Sfp1), there is scant commonality of the gene expression changes or promoter dependence. Interestingly, a similar signaling phenomenon was recently reported for bacteria, where acetate accumulation in the boundary layer affected metabolism, presumably likewise due to lack of convection in microgravity (Zea et al. 2016) and in E. coli where nutrient depletion in simulated microgravity induced stress response genes (Vukanti and Leff 2012).

Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012). The changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averaging and rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effects of true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al. 2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of spaceflight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs. We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models in both ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes, providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al. 2016; Frett et al. 2016) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al. 2017; van Loon 2008). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, spaceflight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and spaceflight had very similar effects. The ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a, d; Birdsall et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.Acknowledgments National Aeronautics and Space Association Grants NNX13AN32G, and NNX12AM93G, supported these studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Transcriptome and proteasome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from several animal species flown in space. Many gene and gene pathway changes associated with changes due to the diverse stimuli of spaceflight have been identified: microgravity, radiation exposure, reduction, and reduction of convection, to say nothing about the effects of launch, maneuvers, and landing. By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we can test a unique hypothesis: Are there tissue specific gene expression pathways activated in individual tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? For pathways that are common, do the same genes predominate, or is the distribution of contributing pathway specific genes differ? Using liver and kidney harvested from the same mice after spaceflight and identically housed ground controls, direct comparison can be made between tissues without confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in microbiome and epigenetics. The mice flew on space shuttle flight STS-108, also known as Utilization Flight 1 (UF-1), to the International Space Station. Data were not published immediately due to a laboratory loss occurred during Hurricane Katrina. We present the data now because contemporary analysis methods can be applied to this unique data set to directly address unanswered but relevant questions.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents All reagents were purchased from Sigma Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise noted. 4.2. Spaceflight Conditions and Ground Based Controls. Working in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center and Bioserve Space Technologies, female C57BL/6J mice were housed in the animal enclosure module (AEM) with special food bars, redundant lixit water supply, and a waste management system. The experiment consisted of six AEMs each with eight mice per AEM. On the space shuttle, three AEMs flew and three served as ground controls. The protocol was reviewed by the Ames IACUC (that served as the Flight IACUC) and was approved on 8 August 2001. The title of protocol was “Investigation of osteoprotegerin as a treatment for spaceflight induced osteopenia on UF-1:STS-108:CBT M-01 payload” and the protocol number was 01-028A-1. The mice were in space for 11 days and 19 hours. Animals were removed from the space shuttle, released from the AEMs, euthanized, kidney and liver tissues harvested as rapidly as practical, and snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen. In each group, eight mice were analyzed. The animals were controls in a study conducted by Amgen, after review by NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The present study examines used tissues discarded from Amgen’s studies and therefore did not undergo separate review by the committee. 4.3. RNA Extraction Samples were transferred to pre-chilled tubes that contained 10 microliters of RNAseOUT (400 U) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Added to the tubes and tissues was 3 mL of Trizol homogenized on ice. RNA was extracted using our standard protocol [8,11]. RNA purity was confirmed by the ratio of OD260 nm to OD 280 nm, which averaged 1.7 and 1.8, and by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with 18S and 28S ribosomal bands corresponding to sizes on a ladder. 4.4. Gene Arrays Gene arrays were performed on Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip® Murine Genome U95Av2.1 (MG-U95Av2.1) set arrays. This array contains transcript coverage of the mouse genome to study the expression level of more than 60,000 murine genes and expressed sequence tags, including ~12,000 sequences characterized in terms of function or disease association. Hybridization controls included bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre. Poly A controls were dap, lys, phe, thr, and trp. Housekeeping/control genes were glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, transferrin receptor, and interferon-stimulated gene factor-3. Gene arrays were performed at the Medical College of Georgia. 4.5. Data Analysis and Statistics Affymetrix Gene Chip microarray data underwent strict quality control processing using the affy package [12] in Bioconductor [1] in the R statistical programming environment. Log-scale Robust Multiarray Analysis was used for normalization to eliminate systematic differences across the arrays. Significant differentially expressed genes were identified using a linear regression model with an empirical Bayes method for parameter estimation from the limma package [13] in the Bioconductor. The False Discovery Rate method was employed to control for multiple hypothesis testing. To perform GSEA, we used Gene Ontology (GO) pathway gene sets found at the Molecular Signatures Database. The DNA microarray data was compared between space flown and ground control tissues and analyzed as to whether the majority of genes in a set fell in the extremes of the list: the top (overexpressed) and bottom (underexpressed) of the list, corresponding to the largest differences in expression between the two conditions. If the gene set was significantly overexpressed or underexpressed, it was taken to be related to phenotypic differences. 4.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis We obtained gene ontology annotations of murine genes using ClueGO. ClueGO is a Cytoscape plug-in that visualizes the non-redundant biological terms for large clusters of genes in a functionally grouped network. ClueGO network is created with kappa statistics and reflects the relationships between the terms based on the similarity of their associated genes. GO biological processes that were too specific (containing less than five genes) or too general (containing greater than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis. Given a query set of genes, we used the hyper geometric test to obtain a P value, estimating the significance with which the set is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process, relative to a gene universe defined as the set of genes with usable data for both static and rotating conditions. 4.7. Cytoscape Analysis Using ClueGO We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps that were generated using an approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin v1.1 [10,14,15]. In contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each map were clustered with Markov cluster (inflation = 2), using the overlap coefficient computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefficients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes in the same cluster were assigned the same node color and a cluster label was determined based on common themes in the processes within the cluster.",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. Gene Arrays Liver and kidney tissues showed similar gene response to spaceflight. Figure 1 shows responses of 12,489 genes in liver versus kidney, expressed as a fold change in space flown versus ground controls, as analyzed by Affymetrix hybridization, along with representative heat maps for the two tissues. (Fold change, average expression, t scores, p-values, and adjusted p values for each gene can be found in Supplementary Table S1.) Of note, CYP4A1 was increased in space-flown liver, whereas over 20 other CYP genes did not change. Figure 1.

Panel (B) is the heat map for representative kidney samples. Panel (C) is the fold-change in gene expression for liver (y-axis) plotted against kidney (x-axis). 2.2. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) provides a computational method to determine whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant and concordant differences between spaceflight and ground controls. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes rather than a single gene. It does not, however, require setting a cutoff, but does allow for an analysis of the complete data set and thus identifies the set of relevant genes as part of the analysis, providing a robust statistical framework. Using a modified Fisher’s exact test, the replicates are integrated into the analysis so that no data are lost [1]. Of the 785 gene ontology (GO) pathways analyzed by GSEA, 764 trended towards concordance between liver and kidney tissue response to spaceflight (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment scores for space-flown vs. ground control mouse liver and kidney. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes across a gene ontology (GO) pathway. A positive score indicates enrichment in the space-flown mice relative to the ground controls. In 764 of the 785 pathways analyzed, there was enrichment in both kidney and liver in response to spaceflight. The nine pathways that were upregulated in liver and downregulated in kidney are listed in the upper left corner and detailed in Table 1. The 12 pathways that were upregulated in kidney but downregulated in liver are listed on the lower right corner and detailed in Table 2.Furthermore, nine pathways were upregulated in the liver and downregulated in the kidney. Five of those pathways were related to T cell activation and the others were related to calcium channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism (see Table 1 for details). Moreover, 12 pathways were upregulated only in kidney but downregulated in liver, whereas only three of those pathways were related to peptide binding and two were related to coagulation. The others were related to amino acid metabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, cell division, DNA packaging, Golgi compartment, and cytokinesis (see Table 2 for details). Table 1.

Cytoscape/ClueGO ClueGO visualizes the interactions of gene clusters in a functionally grouped network using enrichment maps. Similar to the GSEA analysis, liver and kidney showed striking similarities in the ways that they responded to spaceflight (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. In many cases, the exact same pathways were overexpressed in both tissues, as noted by the clusters identified with arrows in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Additional details of the genes for each node can be found in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Mouse liver pathways overexpressed in space.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we were able to evaluate the extent to which tissues from different organs respond to spaceflight in shared ways versus organ-specific ways. We began by examining gene arrays using Affymetrix hybridization and heat maps. We then analyzed the results through GSEA to look for changes across sets of genes, rather than single genes, in order to identify pathways that were in common between the tissues or unique to the particular organs. Finally, we visualized the data by Cytoscape with ClueGO to identify interactions of gene clusters in kidney versus liver. The first major finding of this study was that we had not only shown tissue specific gene pathway response to spaceflight, but we have identified those gene pathways. GSEA analysis of the samples identified significant liver-specific changes in genes for T cell activation, calcium channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism. It is likely that the upregulated T cell activation genes in the liver came from infiltrating T cells. Activation of T cells in spaceflight has been well-described [2], as has the infiltration of the liver with inflammatory mononuclear cells [3]. GSEA analysis also identified significant kidney-specific changes in peptide binding, amine receptor, amino acid catabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, coagulation, cell division, DNA packaging, cytokinesis, and Golgi compartment. The second major finding of this study was that there were common gene pathways upregulated in both the liver and kidney during spaceflight. Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. Our findings in these areas are consistent with the other reports on the livers from mice flown in space, such as an altered ability to respond to insulin [4], impaired management of reactive oxidation (an integral part of apoptosis) [3,5], dysregulated lipid metabolism [3,4], and altered protein kinases [5]. Blaber et al. performed unbiased, unsupervised, and integrated multi-omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets on liver tissue derived from nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice flown in space for 13.5 days [3]. They observed an increased enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. The current data sets show changes in cell death pathways in both kidney and liver, with an emphasis on apoptosis, but also autophagy. Blaber et al. also reported hepatic negative regulation of protein phosphorylation [3], something we now demonstrate in space flown kidney tissue. Like Blaber et al., we saw a highly significant increase in Cdkn1a, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21), in hepatic tissue and now report the same observation in kidney tissue. Cdkn1a gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. The effect of Cdkn1a activation is apparent in the overexpression of apoptosis-regulating pathways in both liver and kidney tissues in space. Baba et al. analyzed gene and protein expression of 11 cytochrome P450s and stress-associated molecules in liver tissue from male Sprague–Dawley rats, aged 65 days at launch and flown in space for nine days [6]. The gene and protein expression of stress-related proteins CYP4A1and Cirp gene expression was significantly increased whereas HSP90 and p53 gene expression was significantly decreased in the flight group than in the ground control. Combined with histology, it was concluded that the effects of spaceflight on the liver may be similar to mild cold stress or fasting. From our data, we can confirm a large increase in hepatic CYP4A1 during spaceflight, as 47 other hepatic CYPs did not change in space. This is consistent with the finding of Brown et al. in the rotating wall vessel, that rat hepatocytes maintained CYP functions and albumin production for more than 30 days in suspension culture [7]. In our data, HSP90 and p53 gene expression were decreased in the flight group similar to the observations of Baba et al. [6], but did not reach statistical significance. Baqai et al. harvested liver, spleen, and thymus from female C57BL/6 mice flown for 13 days in order to study the effects of spaceflight on innate immune function and antioxidant gene expression [5]. During the flight, animals had a reduction in liver, spleen, and thymus masses, compared with ground controls; splenic lymphocyte, monocyte/macrophage, and granulocyte counts were significantly reduced in the flight mice. Baqai et al. concluded that exposure to the spaceflight environment can increase anti-inflammatory mechanisms. No transcriptome analysis was performed. We observed an alpha-beta T-cell activation that is heavily liver-specific, suggesting different immune responses in the liver and kidney during spaceflight. Martinez et al. found a significant reduction of key gene expression in early T-cell activation in C57BL/6J wild-type female mice of similar age and weight flown in space for 15 days [2]. They demonstrated decreases in gene expression for IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ during spaceflight. In our data IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ gene expression was decreased in the flight group similar to the observations of Martinez et al., but did not reach statistical significance [2]. Pecaut et al. studied age- and weight-matched, 11-week-old female C57BL/6J mice flown in space for ~13 days [4]. There were increases in liver expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. They suggested that, given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements. Our data demonstrates changes in lipid metabolism in both liver and kidney tissues in space and further clarifies the gene pathway mediators. In the kidney, we confirm many of the pathways implicated in responses to spaceflight and rotating wall suspension culture in renal proximal tubular cells [8,9]. During spaceflight, we confirmed changes we previously observed in kidney gene pathways, including apoptosis and cellular response to peptides [8]. During the rotating wall suspension culture of renal proximal tubular cells, we observed changes in phosphorylation and protein kinase activity similar to the changes incurred in spaceflight [9]. Spaceflight is a complex mixture of changes in gravity, convection, radiation exposure, and other stressors. While we do not have a detailed similar date on the isolated stimuli for comparison, changes in cell cycle, DNA packing, and oxygenation are consistent with changes in these pathways observed in a number of other systems [10]. We report tissue-specific gene expression pathways in liver and kidney during spaceflight, and for gene pathways that are common, there is a substantial concurrence of the genes that predominate many pathways in both tissues. The confirmation of data from single tissue findings in the literature suggests that our study is reliable. Utilizing liver and kidney tissue harvested from the same mice after spaceflight and identically housed ground controls, is a powerful protocol to optimally remove confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in micro biome and epigenetics.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Liver and kidney show both tissue-specific and shared tissue-common responses to the stress of spaceflight. Liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.

Copyright notice ID: 6321533 PMID: 30567358 Abstract Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. Keywords: spaceflight, microgravity, gene expression, liver, kidney, gene array, gene expression, transcriptome, apoptosis, Cdkn1a, CYP4A11. Introduction Transcriptome and proteasome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from several animal species flown in space. Many gene and gene pathway changes associated with changes due to the diverse stimuli of spaceflight have been identified: microgravity, radiation exposure, reduction, and reduction of convection, to say nothing about the effects of launch, maneuvers, and landing. By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we can test a unique hypothesis: Are there tissue specific gene expression pathways activated in individual tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? For pathways that are common, do the same genes predominate, or is the distribution of contributing pathway specific genes differ? Using liver and kidney harvested from the same mice after spaceflight and identically housed ground controls, direct comparison can be made between tissues without confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in microbiome and epigenetics. The mice flew on space shuttle flight STS-108, also known as Utilization Flight 1 (UF-1), to the International Space Station. Data were not published immediately due to a laboratory loss occurred during Hurricane Katrina. We present the data now because contemporary analysis methods can be applied to this unique data set to directly address unanswered but relevant questions.2. Results 2.1. Gene Arrays Liver and kidney tissues showed similar gene response to spaceflight. Figure 1 shows responses of 12,489 genes in liver versus kidney, expressed as a fold change in space flown versus ground controls, as analyzed by Affymetrix hybridization, along with representative heat maps for the two tissues. (Fold change, average expression, t scores, p-values, and adjusted p values for each gene can be found in Supplementary Table S1.) Of note, CYP4A1 was increased in space-flown liver, whereas over 20 other CYP genes did not change. Figure 1.

Panel (B) is the heat map for representative kidney samples. Panel (C) is the fold-change in gene expression for liver (y-axis) plotted against kidney (x-axis).2.2. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) provides a computational method to determine whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant and concordant differences between spaceflight and ground controls. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes rather than a single gene. It does not, however, require setting a cutoff, but does allow for an analysis of the complete data set and thus identifies the set of relevant genes as part of the analysis, providing a robust statistical framework. Using a modified Fisher’s exact test, the replicates are integrated into the analysis so that no data are lost [1]. Of the 785 gene ontology (GO) pathways analyzed by GSEA, 764 trended towards concordance between liver and kidney tissue response to spaceflight (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment scores for space-flown vs. ground control mouse liver and kidney. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes across a gene ontology (GO) pathway. A positive score indicates enrichment in the space-flown mice relative to the ground controls. In 764 of the 785 pathways analyzed, there was enrichment in both kidney and liver in response to spaceflight. The nine pathways that were upregulated in liver and downregulated in kidney are listed in the upper left corner and detailed in Table 1. The 12 pathways that were upregulated in kidney but downregulated in liver are listed on the lower right corner and detailed in Table 2.Furthermore, nine pathways were upregulated in the liver and downregulated in the kidney. Five of those pathways were related to T cell activation and the others were related to calcium channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism (see Table 1 for details). Moreover, 12 pathways were upregulated only in kidney but downregulated in liver, whereas only three of those pathways were related to peptide binding and two were related to coagulation. The others were related to amino acid metabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, cell division, DNA packaging, Golgi compartment, and cytokinesis (see Table 2 for details). Table 1.

Cytoscape/ClueGO ClueGO visualizes the interactions of gene clusters in a functionally grouped network using enrichment maps. Similar to the GSEA analysis, liver and kidney showed striking similarities in the ways that they responded to spaceflight (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. In many cases, the exact same pathways were overexpressed in both tissues, as noted by the clusters identified with arrows in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Additional details of the genes for each node can be found in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Mouse liver pathways overexpressed in space.

Discussion By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we were able to evaluate the extent to which tissues from different organs respond to spaceflight in shared ways versus organ-specific ways. We began by examining gene arrays using Affymetrix hybridization and heat maps. We then analyzed the results through GSEA to look for changes across sets of genes, rather than single genes, in order to identify pathways that were in common between the tissues or unique to the particular organs. Finally, we visualized the data by Cytoscape with ClueGO to identify interactions of gene clusters in kidney versus liver. The first major finding of this study was that we had not only shown tissue specific gene pathway response to spaceflight, but we have identified those gene pathways. GSEA analysis of the samples identified significant liver-specific changes in genes for T cell activation, calcium channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism. It is likely that the upregulated T cell activation genes in the liver came from infiltrating T cells. Activation of T cells in spaceflight has been well-described [2], as has the infiltration of the liver with inflammatory mononuclear cells [3]. GSEA analysis also identified significant kidney-specific changes in peptide binding, amine receptor, amino acid catabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, coagulation, cell division, DNA packaging, cytokinesis, and Golgi compartment. The second major finding of this study was that there were common gene pathways upregulated in both the liver and kidney during spaceflight. Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. Our findings in these areas are consistent with the other reports on the livers from mice flown in space, such as an altered ability to respond to insulin [4], impaired management of reactive oxidation (an integral part of apoptosis) [3,5], dysregulated lipid metabolism [3,4], and altered protein kinases [5]. Blaber et al. performed unbiased, unsupervised, and integrated multi-omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets on liver tissue derived from nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice flown in space for 13.5 days [3]. They observed an increased enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. The current data sets show changes in cell death pathways in both kidney and liver, with an emphasis on apoptosis, but also autophagy. Blaber et al. also reported hepatic negative regulation of protein phosphorylation [3], something we now demonstrate in space flown kidney tissue. Like Blaber et al., we saw a highly significant increase in Cdkn1a, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21), in hepatic tissue and now report the same observation in kidney tissue. Cdkn1a gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. The effect of Cdkn1a activation is apparent in the overexpression of apoptosis-regulating pathways in both liver and kidney tissues in space. Baba et al. analyzed gene and protein expression of 11 cytochrome P450s and stress-associated molecules in liver tissue from male Sprague–Dawley rats, aged 65 days at launch and flown in space for nine days [6]. The gene and protein expression of stress-related proteins CYP4A1and Cirp gene expression was significantly increased whereas HSP90 and p53 gene expression was significantly decreased in the flight group than in the ground control. Combined with histology, it was concluded that the effects of spaceflight on the liver may be similar to mild cold stress or fasting. From our data, we can confirm a large increase in hepatic CYP4A1 during spaceflight, as 47 other hepatic CYPs did not change in space. This is consistent with the finding of Brown et al. in the rotating wall vessel, that rat hepatocytes maintained CYP functions and albumin production for more than 30 days in suspension culture [7]. In our data, HSP90 and p53 gene expression were decreased in the flight group similar to the observations of Baba et al. [6], but did not reach statistical significance. Baqai et al. harvested liver, spleen, and thymus from female C57BL/6 mice flown for 13 days in order to study the effects of spaceflight on innate immune function and antioxidant gene expression [5]. During the flight, animals had a reduction in liver, spleen, and thymus masses, compared with ground controls; splenic lymphocyte, monocyte/macrophage, and granulocyte counts were significantly reduced in the flight mice. Baqai et al. concluded that exposure to the spaceflight environment can increase anti-inflammatory mechanisms. No transcriptome analysis was performed. We observed an alpha-beta T-cell activation that is heavily liver-specific, suggesting different immune responses in the liver and kidney during spaceflight. Martinez et al. found a significant reduction of key gene expression in early T-cell activation in C57BL/6J wild-type female mice of similar age and weight flown in space for 15 days [2]. They demonstrated decreases in gene expression for IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ during spaceflight. In our data IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ gene expression was decreased in the flight group similar to the observations of Martinez et al., but did not reach statistical significance [2]. Pecaut et al. studied age- and weight-matched, 11-week-old female C57BL/6J mice flown in space for ~13 days [4]. There were increases in liver expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. They suggested that, given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements. Our data demonstrates changes in lipid metabolism in both liver and kidney tissues in space and further clarifies the gene pathway mediators. In the kidney, we confirm many of the pathways implicated in responses to spaceflight and rotating wall suspension culture in renal proximal tubular cells [8,9]. During spaceflight, we confirmed changes we previously observed in kidney gene pathways, including apoptosis and cellular response to peptides [8]. During the rotating wall suspension culture of renal proximal tubular cells, we observed changes in phosphorylation and protein kinase activity similar to the changes incurred in spaceflight [9]. Spaceflight is a complex mixture of changes in gravity, convection, radiation exposure, and other stressors. While we do not have a detailed similar date on the isolated stimuli for comparison, changes in cell cycle, DNA packing, and oxygenation are consistent with changes in these pathways observed in a number of other systems [10]. We report tissue-specific gene expression pathways in liver and kidney during spaceflight, and for gene pathways that are common, there is a substantial concurrence of the genes that predominate many pathways in both tissues. The confirmation of data from single tissue findings in the literature suggests that our study is reliable. Utilizing liver and kidney tissue harvested from the same mice after spaceflight and identically housed ground controls, is a powerful protocol to optimally remove confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in micro biome and epigenetics.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents All reagents were purchased from Sigma Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise noted. 4.2. Spaceflight Conditions and Ground Based Controls. Working in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center and Bioserve Space Technologies, female C57BL/6J mice were housed in the animal enclosure module (AEM) with special food bars, redundant lixit water supply, and a waste management system. The experiment consisted of six AEMs each with eight mice per AEM. On the space shuttle, three AEMs flew and three served as ground controls. The protocol was reviewed by the Ames IACUC (that served as the Flight IACUC) and was approved on 8 August 2001. The title of protocol was “Investigation of osteoprotegerin as a treatment for spaceflight induced osteopenia on UF-1:STS-108:CBT M-01 payload” and the protocol number was 01-028A-1. The mice were in space for 11 days and 19 hours. Animals were removed from the space shuttle, released from the AEMs, euthanized, kidney and liver tissues harvested as rapidly as practical, and snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen. In each group, eight mice were analyzed. The animals were controls in a study conducted by Amgen, after review by NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The present study examines used tissues discarded from Amgen’s studies and therefore did not undergo separate review by the committee. 4.3. RNA Extraction Samples were transferred to pre-chilled tubes that contained 10 microliters of RNAseOUT (400 U) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Added to the tubes and tissues was 3 mL of Trizol homogenized on ice. RNA was extracted using our standard protocol [8,11]. RNA purity was confirmed by the ratio of OD260 nm to OD 280 nm, which averaged 1.7 and 1.8, and by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with 18S and 28S ribosomal bands corresponding to sizes on a ladder.4.4. Gene Arrays Gene arrays were performed on Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip® Murine Genome U95Av2.1 (MG-U95Av2.1) set arrays. This array contains transcript coverage of the mouse genome to study the expression level of more than 60,000 murine genes and expressed sequence tags, including ~12,000 sequences characterized in terms of function or disease association. Hybridization controls included bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre. Poly A controls were dap, lys, phe, thr, and trp. Housekeeping/control genes were glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, transferrin receptor, and interferon-stimulated gene factor-3. Gene arrays were performed at the Medical College of Georgia.4.5. Data Analysis and Statistics Affymetrix Gene Chip microarray data underwent strict quality control processing using the affy package [12] in Bioconductor [1] in the R statistical programming environment. Log-scale Robust Multiarray Analysis was used for normalization to eliminate systematic differences across the arrays. Significant differentially expressed genes were identified using a linear regression model with an empirical Bayes method for parameter estimation from the limma package [13] in the Bioconductor. The False Discovery Rate method was employed to control for multiple hypothesis testing. To perform GSEA, we used Gene Ontology (GO) pathway gene sets found at the Molecular Signatures Database. The DNA microarray data was compared between space flown and ground control tissues and analyzed as to whether the majority of genes in a set fell in the extremes of the list: the top (overexpressed) and bottom (underexpressed) of the list, corresponding to the largest differences in expression between the two conditions. If the gene set was significantly overexpressed or underexpressed, it was taken to be related to phenotypic differences.4.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis We obtained gene ontology annotations of murine genes using ClueGO. ClueGO is a Cytoscape plug-in that visualizes the non-redundant biological terms for large clusters of genes in a functionally grouped network. ClueGO network is created with kappa statistics and reflects the relationships between the terms based on the similarity of their associated genes. GO biological processes that were too specific (containing less than five genes) or too general (containing greater than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis. Given a query set of genes, we used the hyper geometric test to obtain a P value, estimating the significance with which the set is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process, relative to a gene universe defined as the set of genes with usable data for both static and rotating conditions. 4.7. Cytoscape Analysis Using ClueGO We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps that were generated using an approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin v1.1 [10,14,15]. In contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each map were clustered with Markov cluster (inflation = 2), using the overlap coefficient computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefficients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes in the same cluster were assigned the same node color and a cluster label was determined based on common themes in the processes within the cluster. 5. Conclusions Liver and kidney show both tissue-specific and shared tissue-common responses to the stress of spaceflight. Liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. CYP4A1 was increased in space-flown liver, whereas over 20 other CYP genes did not change. Cdkn1a, which encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis was particularly significantly overexpressed in both liver and kidney tissues in space.Acknowledgments We thank the Medical College of Georgia for performing gene arrays.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Central nervous system (CNS) infections of Cryptococcus species are life-threatening diseases. C albidus, also called Naganishia albida, was first reported to infect humans in 1965,[1] and several opportunistic infections associated with C albidus have since been reported.[2–4] To date, the yeast has been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lung abscesses, pleural fluids, and blood specimens of patients.[5] Of those invasive infections, 30% of the patients had a CNS infections.[6] Most notably, the mortality rate was 67% in patients with CNS infections caused by C albidus, which is more than double that of patients infected with other Cryptococcus species.[6] Although fewer than 10 cases of C albidus infection have been reported,[1,7] the fungus has received attention because its mortality rate is high. Here, we report a clinical case of cryptococcal meningitis caused by C albidus. Clinically isolated C albidus may include many other related species, for example, C adeliensis and C diffluent.[8] No clear-cut epidemiological markers have been described to determine the likelihood of C albidus. Recommended guidelines for its treatment are also lacking. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify the risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment for CNS infection due to C albidus and its related species.",

    "discussion": "3. Discussion C albidus in the genus Cryptococcus, is a rare species that causes cryptococcal infections, especially in the CNS infections. The antifungal treatment recommended for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is liposomal-AmB plus flucytosine.[10,11] Although liposomal-AmB has been used for several decades, little is known about its pharmacokinetics in obese patients.[12,13] The prescribing information for cryptococcal disease recommends weight-based doses of 0.7 to 6 mg/kg/day AmB, depending upon the AmB product used. To date, the calculation of the appropriate dose for severely obese patients is controversial.[13,14] Animal studies have demonstrated significantly increased AmB serum concentrations and increased rates of nephrotoxicity in obese rats and rabbits, with poor distribution of adipose tissue.[15] Furthermore, women have a higher body fat rate than men, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury caused by liposomal-AmB.[16] Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider the ideal bodyweight rather than the actual bodyweight when calculating the dose of liposomal-AmB for severely obese female patients. In this case, we have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of using the ideal bodyweight, rather than the actual bodyweight, to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in accordance with the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.”[17–19] Studies of case report relevant to CNS infections attributed to C albidus and its related species in the PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 2024. The following key words were used: fungus, human infection, CNS, meningitis, ventriculitis, encephalitis, non-neoformans, cryptococcus, naganishia, adeliensis, albida, albidus, chernovii, curvatus, diffluens, friedmannii, liquefaciens, magnus, terreus, uniguttulatus, and uzbekitanensis. The references in each manuscript were also reviewed to identify additional cases. Our searches yielded 104 potentially relevant records. After nonhuman species (e.g., dog, cat, pigeon) were excluded,[20,21] 86 studies were included. After non-CNS cases, non-research studies, non-Cryptococcus, C neoformans species complex, and C gattii species complex infections were excluded,[10,22–28] 17 studies were reported. Of those 17 studies, 7 were cohort studies of Cryptococcus,[11,29–34] and 1 study was of C laurentii meningitis combined with C albidus cryptococcaemia.[35] Finally, 9 cases of CNS infections caused by C albidus or its related species have been reported. The risk factors, manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment for these pathogens are presented in table 2. Like other Cryptococcus species, C albidus and its related species were commonly isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts and droppings of birds.[2,36] There is, as yet, no explanation of how humans contract these infections. Reasons may include the worldwide increase in immunocompromised patients, the widespread use of immunosuppressive agents, and the prolonged use of central venous catheters or indwelling devices.[9] In our systematic review of the literature, we detected 2 cases of infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults and 4 in apparently immunodeficient individuals.[3,7,9,38] Leukemia and cancer are important risk factors in HIV-negative patients.[36,37,39] The administration of corticosteroids agents, exposure to bird excrement, contact with animals, and surgery are also risk factors for these infections.[2,3,36] Table 2.

Patients can present with headache, fever, altered mental state, nausea, and vomiting. Headache is the commonest symptom, and only 1 patient reported no headache.[7] Although fever is possible, it only presented in 3 cases (31%). These results are similar to a cohort study that showed fever present in 28% of cases.[29] Patients also presented with increased intracranial pressure increasing and altered mental states, and these neurological symptoms are similar to other cryptococcal infections.[28] The cryptococcal capsule lodges in the arachnoid villi and subsequently prevents CSF reabsorption may explain the elevated intracranial pressure.[40] Culture and API® strip assimilation test are laboratory commonly used methods to identify isolated Cryptococcus species.[7,38,39] However, it may be difficult to identify species when only 1 or 2 methods are used. Without the sequence of the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), some rare Cryptococcus species can be misidentified as C albidus.[8,27,41] For example, a yeast isolate was initially identified as C albidus with an API® strip assimilation test. However, after the internal transcribed spacer and the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit rRNA were sequenced, the isolate was finally confirmed as C liquefaciens.[38] Mass spectrometry is a new methodology for identifying bacterial species, and some studies have shown that the accuracy of mass spectrometry for their identification is over 95% at the species level.[42–44] Hence, the identification of C albidus based on VITEK mass spectrometry is reliable. Because these fungi are infrequent causes of disease, there are no evidence-based guidelines or standard recommendations for their treatment. The susceptibility of C albidus and its related species to antifungal agents is shown in Table 3. The cumulative experience reported in the published literature suggests that AmB is the only agent to which C albidus and its related species are consistently sensitive.[45,46] Therefore, AmB is a safe and effective drug for use as initial induction therapy against these infections in the CNS. However, consideration should be given henceforth to submitting these clinical isolates for susceptibility testing and proper identification to guide subsequent therapeutic decisions. To date, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to optimize the choice of AmB or the duration of its therapy. We recommend: (1) using liposomal-AmB instead of AmB deoxycholate because liposomal-AmB is safer and more rapidly sterilizes the CSF than AmB deoxycholate[11,12,32]; (2) at least 1 g of AmB during treatment and prolonged treatment are recommended.[47] (3) The combination of AmB and 5-fluorocytosine, is recommended because it has been shown to reduce the toxicity of this drug and reduce the relapse rate of C albidus infections.[30,31] Table 3.

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusion Using the ideal bodyweight to calculate the appropriate dose of liposomal-AmB for obese patients with C albidus meningitis is both efficacious and safe. Based on the systematic review of CNS infections of C albidus and its related species, we also concluded that leukemia and cancer are important risk factors for these infections and that headache is the most frequent symptom. The identification of fungal pathogens requires the analysis the rRNA sequences because many species share phenotypic similarities. AmB-based treatment should be the first choice, and subsequent treatment should be guided by susceptibility testing.",

Recommended guidelines for its treatment are also lacking. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify the risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment for CNS infection due to C albidus and its related species.2. Case presentation A 25-year-old female patient (height was 158 cm, bodyweight was 100 kg) was admitted to Beijing Electric Power Hospital (Beijing, China) in March, 2022 with lesions in the intracranial space and accompanying headache. Six months before admission to the hospital, she had undergone successful left temporoparietal occipital craniotomy and decompressive craniectomy. Afterwards, she subsequently suffered intermittent headache, concurrently with nausea and disordered consciousness, and was treated with mannitol and levetiracetam before her admission. The patient denied any family or medical history, except invasive procedures of her CNS 6 months previously. She was a farmer, in frequent contact with cats and dogs. A physical examination revealed no unusual findings. Specifically, her body temperature was 36 °C, blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, pulse rate 68 beats/min, and respiratory rate 17 breaths/min. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal accompanied by moderate edema and left frontal insular region with mild edema. The lesion volume in the right parietal region and the left frontal insular was about 4 × 4 × 3 cm3 and 3 × 3 × 3 cm3, respectively (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the patient before surgery. A type of circular lesion was observed in the right parietal lobe with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted (B) images. The lesion was about 4 × 4 × 3 cm3 in size (red arrow) and accompanied by moderate edema of surrounding brain tissue (yellow arrow). Another type of circular lesion was deep in the left frontal lobe, with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted (B) images. The lesion was about 3 × 3 × 3 cm3 in size (red arrow) and accompanied by mild edema (yellow arrow). Enhanced MRI scanning showed that the lesions were unevenly and significantly enhanced (C).On day 0 (admission), the patient’s associated laboratory data were normal. Specifically, her white blood cell count was 9.5 × 109 L-1; neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes accounted for 73.8%, 21.1%, and 4.9%, respectively. Her red blood cell count was 4.4 × 1012 L-1, hemoglobin level was 133.0 g L-1, and platelet count was 213.0 × 109 L-1. Urinalysis, hepatic and renal function tests were normal. During hospitalization, no chemotherapy and/or other immunosuppressive drug was administered. On day 5 after admission, the patient underwent right parieto-occipital for glioma resection. However, her headache persisted. In the postoperative period, the patient experienced seizures, treated with mannitol and valproic acid. On day 14, she was diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species infection. On day 16, the culture from her CSF sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with VITEK mass spectrometry (BioMerieux, France). To date, no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cutoff values have been established for C albidus. The susceptibility of the pathogen to 5 antifungal compounds was tested in accordance with the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document M27-A3.[9] The minimal inhibitory concentrations of amphotericin B (AmB), fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and 5-fluorocytosine for C albidus were determined to be 0.5, 4, 1, 0.125, and 4 mg L-1, respectively. After the patient was diagnosed with a Cryptococcus species infection, she was administered with of liposomal-AmB (50 mg day-1 intravenously) qd plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally in 4 divided doses) for 6 weeks. Her magnetic resonance imaging results showed that only the left frontal insular region still had a lesion, with otherwise normal parenchyma, after 3 weeks of treatment (Fig. 2). In addition, no yeast was isolated from 3 different CSF samples after 4 weeks of treatment (Table 1). The patient maintained normal renal function during the entire treatment period (Fig. 3). On day 48 after admission, the patient stopped complaining of headache, and suffered no further nausea or consciousness disorder. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge, with normal glucose, protein, and lactate levels in the CSF. Figure 2. Open in a new tab MRI scan of the patient after surgery. The lesion in the right parietal lobe was resected, whereas the lesion in the left frontal lobe (red arrow) was still observed with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted (B) images. Enhanced MRI scanning showed that the lesion was only mildly enhanced after treatment (C).Table 1. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.

Like other Cryptococcus species, C albidus and its related species were commonly isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts and droppings of birds.[2,36] There is, as yet, no explanation of how humans contract these infections. Reasons may include the worldwide increase in immunocompromised patients, the widespread use of immunosuppressive agents, and the prolonged use of central venous catheters or indwelling devices.[9] In our systematic review of the literature, we detected 2 cases of infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults and 4 in apparently immunodeficient individuals.[3,7,9,38] Leukemia and cancer are important risk factors in HIV-negative patients.[36,37,39] The administration of corticosteroids agents, exposure to bird excrement, contact with animals, and surgery are also risk factors for these infections.[2,3,36] Table 2.

Headache is the commonest symptom, and only 1 patient reported no headache.[7] Although fever is possible, it only presented in 3 cases (31%). These results are similar to a cohort study that showed fever present in 28% of cases.[29] Patients also presented with increased intracranial pressure increasing and altered mental states, and these neurological symptoms are similar to other cryptococcal infections.[28] The cryptococcal capsule lodges in the arachnoid villi and subsequently prevents CSF reabsorption may explain the elevated intracranial pressure.[40] Culture and API® strip assimilation test are laboratory commonly used methods to identify isolated Cryptococcus species.[7,38,39] However, it may be difficult to identify species when only 1 or 2 methods are used. Without the sequence of the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), some rare Cryptococcus species can be misidentified as C albidus.[8,27,41] For example, a yeast isolate was initially identified as C albidus with an API® strip assimilation test. However, after the internal transcribed spacer and the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit rRNA were sequenced, the isolate was finally confirmed as C liquefaciens.[38] Mass spectrometry is a new methodology for identifying bacterial species, and some studies have shown that the accuracy of mass spectrometry for their identification is over 95% at the species level.[42–44] Hence, the identification of C albidus based on VITEK mass spectrometry is reliable. Because these fungi are infrequent causes of disease, there are no evidence-based guidelines or standard recommendations for their treatment. The susceptibility of C albidus and its related species to antifungal agents is shown in Table 3. The cumulative experience reported in the published literature suggests that AmB is the only agent to which C albidus and its related species are consistently sensitive.[45,46] Therefore, AmB is a safe and effective drug for use as initial induction therapy against these infections in the CNS. However, consideration should be given henceforth to submitting these clinical isolates for susceptibility testing and proper identification to guide subsequent therapeutic decisions. To date, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to optimize the choice of AmB or the duration of its therapy. We recommend: (1) using liposomal-AmB instead of AmB deoxycholate because liposomal-AmB is safer and more rapidly sterilizes the CSF than AmB deoxycholate[11,12,32]; (2) at least 1 g of AmB during treatment and prolonged treatment are recommended.[47] (3) The combination of AmB and 5-fluorocytosine, is recommended because it has been shown to reduce the toxicity of this drug and reduce the relapse rate of C albidus infections.[30,31] Table 3.

Conclusion Using the ideal bodyweight to calculate the appropriate dose of liposomal-AmB for obese patients with C albidus meningitis is both efficacious and safe. Based on the systematic review of CNS infections of C albidus and its related species, we also concluded that leukemia and cancer are important risk factors for these infections and that headache is the most frequent symptom. The identification of fungal pathogens requires the analysis the rRNA sequences because many species share phenotypic similarities. AmB-based treatment should be the first choice, and subsequent treatment should be guided by susceptibility testing.Acknowledgments We thank the patient for participating in this study.

    "abstract": "Abstract A study was conducted to evaluate the three-dimensional clinostat simulated microgravity effect on mouse models, focusing on the central nervous system. Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional changes in space.

    "introduction": "Introduction Space exploration is a long-term dream and pursuit of humanity, and it is also one of the important fields of technological development. In long-term space flight, astronauts face many problems. One of them is the reduction of gravitational force. Terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and long-term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological changes1. Numerous studies have shown that long-term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and nervous system2. Prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. One of the crucial issues is the impact of long-term spaceflight on brain function. Studies have shown that astronauts experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment3. The high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. Currently, tail-suspension hindlimb unloading is the most classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system4. However, this model has certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal. Besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption5. Three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device that generates multi-directional G forces. By controlling the rotation on both axes, it can offset the cumulative gravity vector at the center of the device6. Previous studies have shown that 3D clinostat have been widely used on plants, cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to simulate microgravity effects7–9. Our previous studies suggest that the central nervous system probably changed in mice trained with 3D clinostat10. Therefore, the aim of our work is to systematically assess 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice by behavioral and multi group analysis, focusing on the changes in central nervous system and cognitive function.",
    "methods": "Methods Mice and treatment 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd and kept in the experimental room at temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 40 ± 5%, under a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) MC group with mice housed in ordinary cage (MC, n = 6); (2) SB group with mice housed in survival box (SB, n = 6); (3) CS group with mice housed in survival box receiving 3D clinostat treatment (CS, n = 6). The structure of the 3D clinostat and the survival box (shown in Supplementary Figure S1) has been described in detail in our previous study10. The rotation modes are as follows: random rotation speed, 0–10 rpm; speed resolution, 0.1 rpm. Before the study, all mice were acclimated to the facility environment for 2 days and then adaptive training was carried out for 5 days to alleviate stress and adapt to the jelly like diet containing 59% water, 1% agar, and 40% purified feed. During training, the CS group underwent adaptive rotation for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h each day, while the MC group was always placed in ordinary cage and the SB group was always placed in survival boxes without any treatment. The formal experiments began at 11 weeks old. The CS group experienced continuous simulated microgravity effect on clinostat for 8 weeks with the exception of cleaning cages and changing food for approximately 20 min per day; the other two groups of mice always lived in corresponding living facilities in the same room. To avoid the interference of acute stress, weight monitoring showed that the body weight of mice in the CS group gradually returned to the control group level after 28 days, suggesting that the mice had fully adapted to the 3D clinostat. Starting from the fifth week, mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments. Following each behavioral experiment, the mice were promptly placed into a 3D clinostat to ensure continuous microgravity effect stimulation. After 8 weeks, the mice were euthanized dissected for sampling at the end of the experiment (Fig. 1a). Animal care was provided in accordance with institutional guidelines and all animal studies were performed in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Laboratory of Animal Science of Peking Union Medical College (IACUC-20220415).

MC: ordinary cage control group; SB: survival box control group; CS: 3D clinostat model group. The data are presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n = 6 for each group. Mouse behavioral tests The sequence of the behavioral experiments was arranged as follows: Grip strength experiment (day 29), Open field test (day 30), Novel object recognition test (day 30–32), Y-Maze (day 33), Elevated plus maze (day 34), Tail suspension test (day 35), Gait analysis (day 36–40), Rotarod test (day 42–44), Morris water maze (day 45–51), Forced swim test (day 52) and Fear conditioning test (day 53–56). Each mouse was tested individually and then put back into the 3D clinostat as soon as possible after the test to minimize the time spent disengaging from the rotation. Detailed methods of behavioral testing are as follows: Grip strength experiment The evaluation of grip strength was conducted using a grip strength meter. Each animal was individually placed on the grip strength board and pulled by the tail, prompting them to grasp the bar. The rodents instinctively grasp anything in order to prevent this involuntary backward movement until the pulling force exceeds their grip strength. The maximum value of grip strength was recorded using the Bioseb system. Each animal was tested three times repeatedly, and the mean value was calculated. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 15 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Open field test The open field was an empty square environment, with a size of 50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm. A central area was marked in the open field, centered in the middle of the empty space, with a square length of 16 cm zone. The fringe area was 10 cm wide. The animals were placed in the middle of the central area and observed for five minutes. Behavioral parameters including velocity, distance traveled, and time spent in the central and fringe areas were recorded by a computerized video tracking system (Ethovision XT; Noldus, Information Technology, The Netherlands). The open field apparatus was cleaned after each session using 70% ethanol and allowed to dry between tests. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Novel object recognition test The novel object recognition test was used to assess short- and long-term recognition memory. The experimental procedure consisted of three stages. On the first day, there was an adaptation period without any toy bricks. On the second day, familiarization took place with two toy bricks (2 cm × 2 cm) in opposite corners, both with the same shape, size, and color. On the third day, the test period occurred, with one of the toy bricks changed to a different shape and color. The camera on top of the box was used to record how long it took for a mouse to examine the new object (TN) and the familiar object (TF), allowing a total of five minutes for exploring the two distinct objects. The recognition index was calculated as follows: Recognition index = (TN/(TN + TF)) × 100%. A higher recognition index reflected better short- and long-term recognition memory abilities in animals within this group. The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Y-maze In the Y-maze test, each mouse was placed at the end of one arm of the 'Y' and allowed to explore the maze freely for five minutes. The sequence of entry of the mice in the arms was recorded to calculate the percentage of change. The mouse entered three different arms in turn, which was counted as one alternation. Spontaneous alternations (%) = Number of spontaneous alternations/(Total number of arm entries − 2) *100%. Higher spontaneous alternations indicated better learning and memory ability. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Elevated plus maze During the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test, the maze was composed of four arms (30 cm × 5 cm). Two opposite arms were closed, enclosed by lateral walls (depth 5 cm), and the remaining two arms were open and lacked walls. The four arms were connected by a central area (5 cm × 5 cm), and the maze was elevated 50 cm from the floor. During the test, mice were placed on the central square platform and allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. The following parameters were recorded and analyzed: the number of entries into open/closed arms, the time spent in the open/closed arms, and the total number of arm entries. These data were recorded by a camera and analyzed using a computerized video tracking system. The anxiety index was calculated as the ratio of open arm time and entries to total time and total entries. The open arm entries percent was calculated as entries into the open arm divided by the total number of arm entries (entries into the open arm + entries into the closed arm). During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Tail suspension test The Tail Suspension Test was performed as previously described11. Adhesive tape was applied to the tail, approximately 1 cm from the tip, and the mouse was suspended for 6 min. After a 2 min habituation period, the immobility time was recorded during the final 4 min using Tail Suspension Real-Time Analysis (System-2.0). During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Gait analysis The gait of naturally moving mice was analyzed using CatWalk XT (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands), as previously described12. This gait analysis system consists of a glass walkway floor illuminated with a green light that is completely internally reflected in the glass, a standard charge-coupled device (CCD) camera underneath, and software for recording and analyzing the data obtained from mouse paws. A darkroom box was used at the end of the walkway to create an incentive for the mice to cross the field, where the entrance to their home cage is placed. The mice were placed in the front of the start zone of the walkway and were trained to cross the walkway with five accomplished runs per day on five consecutive days. The test was started on the fifth day, and each mouse was tested three times. The successful run was defined as a mouse walking across the runway without any hesitation. The walkway was cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol between each animal. Gait parameters of footprints were automatically generated (left front, LF; left hind, LH; right front, RF; and right hind, RH). The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Rotarod test The rotarod apparatus (Model: 47600, Italy) was used to assess the locomotor abilities of rodents, particularly their coordination and endurance. Mice were subjected to a training session of four trials per day for 3 days, the rotarod gradually accelerated from 5 to 40 rpm within 120 s until the mouse fell off. Starting from the 4th day after training, formal testing experiments were conducted. During test trial, the rotarod gradually accelerated from 5 to 40 rpm within 300 s. The latency at which the mouse fell from the rod (or a maximum of 5 min) was recorded. The average latency from three trials was determined. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 30 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Morris water maze The water maze was divided into four quadrants and contained a platform that remained submerged under 1–1.5 cm of water. During the training trials, mice were placed in the water from the opposite quadrant of the platform. Successful navigation to the platform was considered when the mouse found it within 1 min. If the mouse failed to find the platform within this time limit, a guidance rod was used to guide the mouse to stay on the platform for 10 s and the latency was recorded as 60 s. Training trials were conducted for three trial sessions each day for six consecutive days. During probe trials, the platform was removed from the maze. Frequency of visits to the platform, time spent in the platform quadrant, cumulative duration in the target zone, and latency to the platform were used as indicators of memory performance. The behavioral test time was about 30 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Forced swim test The forced swim test was performed as previous studies13. Each mouse was individually placed into a non-transparent cylindrical plastic container (height of 25 cm; diameter of 18 cm) containing 15 cm of water at 23–25 °C. The test duration was 6 min, and immobility was analyzed during the last 4 min. Immobility behavior was considered by inactive time when the animal remained floating passively without any movements, with the exception of minimal movements to keep the head above water. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Fear conditioning test Both contextual and cued fear conditioning protocols were implemented as previous studies14. On the first day, mice were introduced to a Plexiglas training cage under constant illumination for 5 min. On the second day, animals were allowed to adapt for 180 s in the box before commencing three to five rounds of circulation training. Auditory stimulation (30 s, 5 kHz, 70 dB) was then administered, followed by the delivery of electric current stimulation (0.65 mA, 1 s). The intervals between each training session were 30–60 s. Animals were allowed to remain in the cage for 30 s before being returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, a contextual fear conditioning test was conducted by placing animals back into the same training cage without any sound or electric current stimulation, and their freezing behavior was recorded over a 330 s period. On the fourth day, cued fear conditioning began. The background and smell of the boxes were changed, and after 180 s of adaptation in the box, only auditory stimulation (5 kHz, 70 dB) was presented. Freezing behavior was then recorded over a 420 s period. Prior to each animal’s placement, the fear-conditioning box was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing. Brain transcriptomics Brain samples were bisected along the plane separating the hemispheres. For each brain, one hemisphere was selected for the generation of mRNA sequencing data, following a methodology similar to that described in the previously published paper15. Total RNA extraction was carried out using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. To assess the quality and quantity of the extracted RNA, the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) was employed. The integrity of the RNA was then evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Subsequently, RNA libraries were constructed with the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit, strictly adhering to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transcriptome sequencing and subsequent analysis were conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads. The raw reads in fastq format underwent an initial processing step using fastp. During this process, low-quality reads were filtered out to obtain clean reads suitable for further analysis. The clean reads were then mapped to the reference genome using HISAT2. To quantify gene expression levels, the FPKM of each gene was calculated and the read counts for each gene were obtained via HTSeq-count. To evaluate the biological duplication of the samples, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the R programming language (version 3.2.0). For the differential expression analysis, the DESeq2 package was utilized. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed if they met the criteria of a P value < 0.05 and a fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.667. Bioinformatic analysis and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at https://cloud.oebiotech.com/task/. The hindlimb unloading mice and real spaceflight microgravity mice brain transcriptome data have been sourced from published data. Specifically, the brain RNA-seq data of hindlimb unloading mice, which underwent hindlimb unloading for 2 weeks and had their total RNA extracted from each brain using Trizol for transcriptome analysis (GeneLab ID: GLDS-32, 10.26030/jpyz-fn46), and the data from spaceflight mice, that were housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days, euthanized in space (mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine and subjected to cardiac puncture followed by cervical dislocation), and had their whole carcasses stored at − 80 °C during the Rodent Research-3 mission (GeneLab ID: GLDS-352, 10.26030/jm59-zy54), are both accessible within the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio). Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2. P value < 0.05 and foldchange > 1.5 or foldchange < 0.667 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression gene. Bioinformatic analysis and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at https://cloud.oebiotech.com/task/. To compare the differences between three models, namely the 3D clinostat model (CS), hindlimb unloading model (HU), and space flight mice (FL), we conducted a distance comparison of transcriptome changes. Select shared genes from transcriptome data for analysis, and obtain log2FoldChang values for each gene, namely FCCS(1,2,3…n), FCHU(1,2,3…n), FCFL(1,2,3…n), and then calculate the brain transcriptome distance between each model, SCS/FL = , SHU/FL = , SCS/HU = . The similarity of the three models can be compared by the magnitude of the distance value S. By utilizing the multiple expression changes of each gene in different models relative to their respective control groups, a heatmap can be drawn to visually display and compare the differences in the brain transcriptome of each model. Serum metabolomics To extract metabolites, 400 μl of cold extraction solvent methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:2:1) was added to 100 μl of serum sample and adequately vortexed. The samples were then incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For LC–MS analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) solvent and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C for 15 min, then the supernatant was injected. For the untargeted metabolomics of polar metabolites, extracts were analyzed using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Sciex Triple TOF 6600) coupled to hydrophilic interaction chromatography via electrospray ionization by the Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. Ltd. Preparation of QC samples by mixing aliquots of all samples. The raw LC–MS data obtained were processed using Proqenesis QI Software (Waters Corporation Milford, USA). For statistical analysis, we made use of both univariate (Student’s t-test and fold change analysis) and multivariate (principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) method. The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores > 1 and P values < 0.05, and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 were used to filter the differential metabolites. For the KEGG annotation of metabolic pathways, the metabolites were compared against the online KEGG database using BLAST to retrieve their COs, and then mapped to the corresponding KEGG pathways16–18. Analysis of the diversity of gut microbiota in feces OE biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) conducted the 16S amplicon sequencing and analysis. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and its concentration and purity were assessed by NanoDrop 2000 (Agilent, USA). The extracted DNA was used as template for PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA with universal primers for V3-V4 variable regions. Sequencing was performed by Illuminaa NovaSeq 6000 with 250 bp paired-end reads. The raw sequencing data, in FASTQ format, were preprocessed using Cutadapt software to remove adapters. Following trimming, low-quality sequences were filtered out, and the remaining reads were denoised, merged, and chimera-checked using DADA2 with default QIIME2 parameters. The software ultimately output representative reads and an ASV abundance table. The representative read of each ASV was selected using the QIIME2 package, and all representative reads were annotated against the Silva database using q2-feature-classifier. Micro-CT imaging of bone The femoral bone was dissected of soft tissues, fixed in formalin and the distal metaphysis scanned with a Siemens INVEON scanner using the following settings: tube voltage, 60 kV; tube current, 400 µA; and exposure time, 800 ms over 360° rotation. The Feldkamp filtered back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the images to generate 3D reconstructions. Images acquired from the scanner were viewed and calculated morphometric parameters with INVEON Workplace software. Statistical analysis The data are shown as means ± SD. GraphPad Prism 10.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc test evaluated the significance of differences between groups. A difference was considered significant if the P value < 0.05.",
    "results": "Results Effects of 3D clinostat on the body weight and general status in mice Figure 1b showed the daily changes in weight of mice over the first 4 weeks. The SB group mice exhibited a weight profile similar to that of the MC group, indicating good adaptability to survival box. In contrast, the CS group mice undergoing 3D clinostat initially experienced a significant weight loss during the first 4 days. However, these mice gradually adapted to the 3D clinostat and their weight stabilized, followed by a slow recovery to levels similar to those of the SB control group and MC control group. Overall, the mice appeared healthy throughout the study period, indicating good adaptability to the 3D clinostat instrument. The impact of 3D clinostat on cognitive and motor related behavior We conducted a series of behavioral experiments to observe the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect on cognitive and motor related behaviors in mice. The results showed 3D clinostat treatment significantly reduced mice activity and exploratory desire, indicated by the significant reduction in movement distance and exercise time in the open field test as shown in Fig. 1c–d, as well as in other behavioral experiments, including Y Maze, elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test (data not shown). In terms of learning and memory, there were no statistically significant differences in the recognition index in novel object recognition test (Fig. 1e), the spontaneous alternations index in the Y maze (Fig. 1f), and the latency to the platform in the Morris water maze (Fig. 1g) between CS and SB group, suggesting that 3D clinostat did not have a significant impact on the learning and memory. Regarding motor ability, a series of tests including grip strength test, rotarod test, and gait analysis were conducted. The results of the grip strength test revealed no notable differences among the three groups of mice (Fig. 2a). In the rotarod test, mice in the SB group exhibited a significantly shorter latency to fall compared to those in the MC group. This shorter latency may be attributed to the restricted activity space within the survival box for the SB group mice. Conversely, the CS group mice displayed a significantly longer latency to fall compared to the SB group, potentially due to their gradually acquired balancing ability through the 3D clinostat process (Fig. 2b). Besides, gait analysis revealed significant changes in certain gait parameters in the CS group compared to the SB group, indicating that prolonged exposure to the 3D clinostat had a notable impact on the vestibular balance system (Table 1, with the raw data shown in Supplementary Table S1). In terms of anxiety and depression, we conducted a series of experiments including the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and elevated plus maze. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups of mice in terms of the duration of immobility in both the forced swim test and tail suspension test, as well as the percentage of open arm entries in the elevated plus maze. These findings suggest that exposure to the 3D clinostat did not result in significant depression or anxiety tendencies (Fig. 2, c-e). However, in the fear conditioning test, the 3D clinostat seemed to induce a trend towards increased sensitivity to fear behavior and enhanced fear memory. During the fear memory learning phase, the CS group mice exhibited a notable increase in freezing rates (Fig. 2f), coupled with a tendency of increased freezing rates in the contextual memory phase (Fig. 2g). Especially during the extinction phase, CS mice still demonstrated a significant increase in freezing rate, indicating enhanced fear memory and weakened extinction (Fig. 2h). Additionally, an increasing trend in freezing rate was also observed in the CS group mice during the subsequent sound stimulus phase (Fig. 2i). Upon comprehensive analysis of the behavioral research, it can be concluded that the 3D clinostat did not exert a notable influence on learning and memory processes. However, it potentially influenced the fear behavioral, along with subtle alterations related to motor balance. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Behavioral test results.

The impact of 3D clinostat on femur parameter To investigate the effects of 3D clinostat on bone metabolism, we utilized micro-CT to scan the femurs of mice and analyzed changes in parameters such as bone volume, tissue volume, trabecular pattern factor, trabecular number, and trabecular separation. The results revealed that both SB and CS group of mice exhibited significant bone loss compared to the MC group, with a notable decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, as well as a significant increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation. Furthermore, compared to the SB group, the CS group displayed a trend of further aggravating bone loss (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Changes in femoral bone parameters by micro-CT scanning.

The impact of 3D clinostat on brain transcriptome To evaluate the impact of 3D clinostat on the central nervous system, we conducted whole brain transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that there were 568, 320, and 426 significantly different genes between each group respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a. Figure 4b displays a heatmap of gene expression among the three groups for 320 genes that exhibited significant differences between the CS and SB groups. To further analyze the impact of 3D clinostat on the brain, we conducted KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes, as shown in Fig. 4 c. 3D clinostat may primarily affect immune and endocrine-related signaling pathways, such as those associated with human diseases like Malaria, African trypanosomiasis, Autoimmune thyroid disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and Staphylococcus aureus infection, as well as GnRH secretion and signaling pathway, Ovarian steroidogenesis, IL17 signaling pathway, Prolactin signaling pathway, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, PPAR signaling pathway, and Neutrophil extracellular trap formation.

MC: ordinary cage control group; SB: survival box control group; CS: 3D clinostat model group. The impact of 3D clinostat on serum metabolomics To investigate the systemic effects of the 3D clinostat on mice, we conducted a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples. This experiment yielded a total of 15,470 detected substances, among which 1431 were annotated as known metabolic molecules. OPLS-DA analysis revealed distinct differentiation among the three groups (Fig. 4d). Notably, in comparison to the SB group, the CS group exhibited significant upregulation of serum metabolites such as Lys-Leu, 2-keto-D-Gluconic acid, Thyroxine 4’-o-.beta.-d-glucuronide, Beta-octylglucoside, Demissidine, Pro-Trp, and Pentobarbital. Conversely, serum metabolites including Poricoic acid a, L-Lysine, Oleic acid, Ile-Pro, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-n,n-dimethyl, Niacinamide, and 1-(1z-octadecenyl)-2-(4z,7z,10z,13z,16z,19z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were significantly downregulated (Fig. 4e). These alterations primarily implicate pathways such as ABC transporters, Sphingolipid signaling pathway and metabolism, Biotin metabolism, and the Pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 4f). The impact of 3D clinostat on microbiome To investigate the impact of 3D clinostat on the gastrointestinal microbiota, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on mouse feces samples, revealing 333 ± 23, 273 ± 36, and 267 ± 43 ASVs detected in each group, respectively. In terms of alpha diversity, the fecal microbiota richness was observed to be higher in the MC group compared to the SB and CS groups (Fig. 5b). However, no significant differences were observed in the Shannon index among the three groups (Fig. 5c). Regarding beta diversity, PCA analysis demonstrated distinct segregation of the fecal microbiota profiles among the three groups (Fig. 5a). At the genus level, Fig. 6d illustrated the top 10 differentially abundant bacterial genera among the three groups. Notably, the Bacteroides and Turicibacter were significantly reduced in the CS group compared to both the SB and MC groups (Fig. 5d). Functional analysis of the microbial community was conducted using the PICRUSt2 software. The results indicated significant differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups, specifically in Ferroptosis, PPAR signaling pathway, Lysosome, Glycosaminoglycan degradation, Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and Other glycan degradation (Fig. 5e). These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of 3D clinostat on the composition and functional properties of the gastrointestinal microbiota, suggesting potential implications for host health.

Comparison of 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect model with classical hindlimb unloading model and spaceflight mice. To comprehensively assess the validity of the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect model, we conducted a comparative analysis of mRNA expression profiles in brain tissue, juxtaposing our findings with those derived from literature on hindlimb unloading (HU) mice and spaceflight (FL) mice models. The study revealed minimal overlap among the three models, underscoring substantial variations. Specifically, eight differentially expressed genes (Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1) were shared between the CS and FL models, whereas only two genes (Serpinc1 and Ccl19) overlapped between the HU and FL models. Notably, no shared differentially expressed genes were identified between the CS and HU models, highlighting notable disparities between these two models (Fig. 6a). These findings imply that neither the CS nor the HU model perfectly recapitulates the complex effects of actual space microgravity on the brain, albeit the CS model demonstrates relatively greater fidelity compared to the HU model. With respect to the functional disparities among genes, the HU model predominantly features genes tied to neurodegenerative disorders, whereas the FL model encompassed a diverse array of genes related to immunity, endocrinology, cardiovascular functions, and beyond. Among the top 20 KEGG pathways, the GnRH signaling pathway stands out as a significantly altered pathway across all three models, highlighted in red. Notably, the CS and FL models share additional two commonly altered pathways: Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and Ovarian steroidogenesis, both denoted with blue. Furthermore, Diabetic cardiomyopathy, indicated with green, emerges as a shared altered pathway between the CS and HU models. These observations imply that the CS model exhibited a greater degree of similarity to the FL model in comparison to the HU model (Fig. 6b–c). To compare the differences in brain gene expression profiles across these three models, we performed a comprehensive distance comparison involving 5687 genes that were consistently detected in all models. The results of this analysis are as follows: SCS/FL = , SHU/FL = , and SCS/HU = . Notably, the SCS/FL distance emerges as significantly smaller than the SHU/FL distance, underscoring the closer resemblance of the CS model to the FL model in terms of gene expression patterns. Additionally, by generating a heatmap that visualizes the expression levels of 131 genes commonly detected in all three models and fulfilling the criteria of differential expression (P value < 0.05 and and foldchange > 2 or foldchange < 0.5) in at least one model, it becomes strikingly apparent that the CS model demonstrates a superior performance compared to the HU model (Fig. 6d).",
    "discussion": "Discussion This study explored the impact of simulated microgravity effect using a 3D clinostat on mice, with a particular focus on behavioral, metabolic, gut microbiome and brain transcriptome changes. Our findings revealed that the simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3D clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the central nervous system. This model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying spaceflight-related health risks. In this study, the behavioral experiments demonstrated that the 3D clinostat had a significant impact on the physical activity and exploratory behavior. The observed reduction in movement distance and exercise time in the open field test, combined with similar findings in the Y Maze, elevated plus maze, and novel object recognition tests, suggests a marked decrease in the overall motivation and exploratory drive. These results are consistent with existing literature on the effects of microgravity, where diminished activity levels and altered behavioral patterns have been reported19–21. For instance, mice displayed similar declines in exploratory behavior after a 30-day spaceflight on Bion-M1 satellite21. Different from past results, we did not find obvious anxiety or depression in mice20,22,23. It is known that chronic restraint can lead to anxiety and depression24. We speculate that the anxiety or depression emotion of animals found in the HU model might be caused by tail suspension and restraint, rather than the direct effect of microgravity. The absence of notable disparities in learning and memory between the CS and SB groups, as assessed by the Morris water maze and other memory related tests, might initially seem surprising. One would expect that the reduced physical activity and altered emotional states might extend to cognitive functions. However, the results suggest that the impact of microgravity on cognition might be more complex, potentially involving compensatory mechanisms that preserve cognitive abilities despite changes in other behavioral domains. This finding aligns with studies in which astronauts, despite experiencing emotional and physical stressors, often maintain cognitive performance during space missions, possibly due to intensive training and adaptation processes25. In fact, there are indeed some controversies about the effects of microgravity on cognitive function25–27. During spaceflights, the overall cognitive performance of astronauts does not show significant decline, but their cognitive function declines notably after returning to Earth25. Wollseiffen et al. found that neurocognitive performance can even be improved during short-term microgravity, thus suspecting that cognitive impairment is caused by the combined effects of complex spaceflight stressors rather than microgravity itself28. The adaptive changes such as changes in brain blood supply caused by re-adaptation to the gravitational environment after the flight, rather than microgravity itself, may be the key factors that lead to changes in cognitive function. Besides, it is also possible that the short duration of microgravity effect exposure in our study was insufficient to produce detectable cognitive deficits. Future studies with prolonged exposure and more sensitive cognitive assessments might reveal subtle impairments not captured in this study. The motor coordination and balance tests, such as the rotarod and gait analysis, indicated subtle yet significant changes in the vestibular system of the mice. These alterations are particularly relevant given the well-documented vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during and after space missions29. The role of vestibular system in spatial orientation and balance is crucial, and its disruption in microgravity can lead to disorientation, dizziness, and impaired motor function30. Under the premise that there was no significant change in grip strength, our findings indicated that the latency to fall in the rotarod test for CS group was increased compared to SB group, suggesting an adaptation or learning process that may mimic the vestibular compensation observed in astronauts. This adaptive response could be due to the continuous 3D clinostat environment, which might induce a reorganization of neural circuits involved in balance and coordination. Interestingly, the fear conditioning test showed that the 3D clinostat treated mice exhibited an increased sensitivity to fear stimuli and enhanced fear memory. This observation might be linked to changes in the amygdala and related brain structures, which are critical for processing fear and stress responses31. Research on rats has revealed significant alterations in amygdala neural activity after landing, marked by Fos-positive cells, suggesting a potential impact on fear-related emotional responses32,33. In 15 days of –6° head-down bed rest, volunteers showed temporal overestimation of the fear stimuli in the middle phase34. This finding has important implications for understanding the psychological and emotional challenges faced by astronauts during long-term space missions, where prolonged exposure to microgravity could exacerbate stress and anxiety, potentially impairing mission performance and well-being. In the conditioned fear experiment, the most significant difference between the CS and SB groups occurred during the fear extinction phase, suggesting an attenuation of fear memory extinction. The specific neural circuit mechanisms underlying this phenomenon require further in-depth research. In terms of bone density, mice in the CS group exhibited a decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, accompanied by a notable increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation, indicating bone loss changes, when compared to the MC control group. However, despite a seemingly more pronounced tendency towards bone loss in the CS group compared to the SB group, no statistically significant difference was observed. This may be attributed to the enhanced gripping and limb loading during the 3D clinostat process, as the mice attempted to counteract the body repositioning caused by the rotation. In the rotarod test, the prolonged fall latency observed in mice from the CS group, as well as subtle gait alterations detected in gait analysis, may also be associated with the similar underlying reasons. On the other hand, the restricted space within the survival box likely constrained the motor abilities of the SB group mice, and simultaneously induced bone loss in these mice. This could potentially account for the reduced difference between the CS and SB groups, representing another plausible explanation. The transcriptomic analysis of the brain tissues revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with immune response, endocrine signaling, and nervous system functions. These alterations suggested that the simulated microgravity effect triggered a broad and complex biological response, affecting multiple systems that are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and health. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances in response to microgravity in spaceflight animal models35,36. Immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances could lead to a range of health problems, including increased susceptibility to infections, metabolic disorders, and mental health issues. Effective monitoring and the development of targeted interventions could help mitigate these risks and improve the health of astronauts. One of the key findings of this study is the differential gene expression pattern observed in the CS model compared to the HU and FL models. The minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes between these models highlights the distinct biological effects induced by each type of simulated microgravity effect. Specifically, the CS model appears to more closely mimic the gene expression changes seen in real spaceflight, particularly in terms of immune and endocrine-related pathways. This suggests that the 3D clinostat might be a more accurate and reliable model for studying the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system. The CS and FL models demonstrated a convergent alteration in three KEGG signaling pathways: GnRH signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and Ovarian steroidogenesis, as well as eight common differential genes, including Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1. The GnRH signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the hypothalamus, regulating the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Under microgravity conditions, significant changes occur in the endocrine system, which may impact the release of GnRH and the activity of the signaling pathway. This alteration in the GnRH signaling pathway may subsequently lead to fluctuations in sex hormone levels and participate in the regulation of cognition, emotion, and behavior37. The Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction pathway encompasses the intricate interplay between numerous neurotransmitters and hormones (such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and others) and their respective receptors. This interaction is vital for neural transmission, emotional regulation, cognitive functions, and neural plasticity. Microgravity and spaceflight can potentially induce alterations in neural adaptability, as well as changes in the levels and sensitivity of neurotransmitters, which may be linked to the Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction38. The Ovarian Steroidogenesis signaling pathway is concerned with the production of estrogen and progesterone. Although ovarian steroidogenesis primarily occurs within the reproductive system, it also exerts significant influence on the brain, particularly in regulating emotions, cognition, and neural plasticity39. Furthermore, estrogen possesses neuroprotective properties, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal health and function40. Under microgravity conditions, a decrease in estrogen levels may diminish its neuroprotective effects, potentially increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases or cognitive decline. The greater similarity in gene expression profiles between the CS and FL models supports the use of this method as a representative model for spaceflight-induced neurobiological changes. The lack of overlap in differentially expressed genes between the HU and FL models further underscores the limitations of the HU model in replicating the effects of actual spaceflight. While the HU model has been widely used to simulate microgravity effect, particularly for studying muscle atrophy and bone loss, it appears to fall short in accurately modeling the complex changes in brain function induced by real spaceflight41,42. This discrepancy may be due to the localized nature of the HU model, which primarily affects the hindlimbs and may not adequately capture the whole-body effects of microgravity. In contrast, the 3D clinostat model provides a more holistic simulation of microgravity effect, potentially leading to more relevant insights into how spaceflight affects the brain. The HU model demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to alterations in cerebral blood flow, rendering it an appropriate choice for investigating notable cognitive shifts following return from spaceflight, while the 3D clinostat model is more likely to focus on subtle cognitive changes caused by adaptation to microgravity in space, which may be related to vestibular function and spatial orientation. The metabolomic analysis of serum samples provided additional insights into the systemic effects of 3D clinostat model. The observed alterations in various metabolic pathways, including ABC transporters, Sphingolipid signaling, and the Pentose phosphate pathway, suggest that microgravity effect disrupts lipid metabolism, energy production, and cellular signaling processes. The downregulation of key metabolites such as L-Lysine, oleic acid, and niacinamide points to potential deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could exacerbate the stress response and impair overall health. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid involved in protein synthesis, while oleic acid is a major component of membrane phospholipids and has anti-inflammatory properties43. Niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, is crucial for energy production and DNA repair44,45. The reduction in these metabolites suggests that microgravity might lead to nutritional imbalances that could have far-reaching effects on health. The microbiome analysis further supports these findings, showing significant alterations in gut microbiota composition, particularly the reduction in Bacteroides and Turicibacter. The reduction in Bacteroides is consistent with the reported elevation of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the intestinal flora of astronauts during spaceflights25. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in regulating immune function, metabolism, and overall health, and its disruption could have serious consequences during spaceflight. Previous studies have shown that changes in the gut microbiota can lead to a range of health issues, including immune dysregulation, metabolic disorders, and even mental health problems45. The observed changes in the gut microbiota in this study suggest that simulated microgravity effect may lead to similar health challenges, emphasizing the need for strategies to maintain gut health during long-term space missions. The functional analysis of the microbial community revealed significant differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups. Pathways such as Ferroptosis, PPAR signaling, and Glycosaminoglycan degradation were notably affected, indicating potential alterations in cellular death processes, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These changes could have implications for tissue integrity and function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, which is highly sensitive to environmental stressors46. The disruption of these pathways could contribute to the gastrointestinal problems of astronauts, such as increased gut permeability, altered bowel habits and increased susceptibility to infections47. The alterations in gut microbiota composition observed in this study also suggest that dietary interventions or probiotics could be explored as potential strategies to maintain gut health during space missions. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the health risks associated with long-term spaceflight. The 3D clinostat model offers a practical and cost-effective method for simulating microgravity effect on Earth, allowing for the systematic study of its effects on various physiological systems. The results suggest that microgravity may have a more pronounced impact on emotional and motivational states than on cognitive functions, highlighting the need for further research into the psychological well-being of astronauts during extended missions. While our study provided important insights into the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, although some behavioral changes were observed, many of them did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the relatively small sample size in the study, leading to the possibility that subtle behavioral changes might have been overlooked. Secondly, in space environments, males and females exhibit gender-specific differences in the responses of various bodily systems. This study exclusively used male mice; however, considering the impact of gender factors, it is a scientifically valuable question worth further investigation to determine whether female mice exhibit different responses to the 3D clinostat. Furthermore, we noted significant differences in multiple behavioral indicators, as well as in the transcriptome and metabolome, between mice in the survival box control (SB) group compared to ordinary cage control (MC) group, highlighting the crucial impact of social isolation and spatial confinement on the organism. Further analysis of the synergistic effects of microgravity, social isolation, and spatial constraints is a scientific issue worthy of further attention in the next step. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that variability in transcriptome data may be influenced by differences in time points, exposure durations, and collection methodologies employed across clinostat studies, hindlimb unloading experiments, and spaceflight missions. Additionally, although mice spend most of their time inactive in the resting chamber of the survival box, they may still be forced to move or perform actions against gravity-direction changes. It is acknowledged that the 3D clinostat and hindlimb unloading models do not truly simulate microgravity in a strict physical sense. The 3D clinostat creates a condition where the gravity orientation continuously changes, and the hindlimb unloading model provides mechanical unloading. However, our study focuses on the biological effects that resemble those under microgravity conditions. The data from the 3D clinostat—treated mice show changes in behavior, metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Although these changes may be due to the mice’s response to altered gravity orientation rather than actual microgravity, they share similarities with the biological effects observed in spaceflight studies. For instance, the changes in the vestibular system, as indicated by gait analysis, are consistent with the vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during space missions. Similarly, the alterations in immune and endocrine—related signaling pathways in the brain transcriptome are also in line with previous spaceflight—related research. These similarities suggest that the 3D clinostat model can serve as a valuable tool for studying the potential biological consequences of microgravity on Earth. It is important to acknowledge the differences in physical principles between our models and actual spaceflight, and when selecting models, one must be mindful of these differences to ensure that the appropriate animal model is chosen according to the research objectives. Nevertheless, due to the limitations and difficulties of simulating microgravity on Earth, the 3D clinostat mouse model for simulating microgravity is a powerful supplement to the limited ground-based models currently available. The 3D clinostat model provided a more similar simulation of brain gene expression alterations than hindlimb unloading, yet future research is essential to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed behavioral and neurobiological changes, particularly through targeted studies on specific brain regions and molecular pathways. For example, studying the effects of microgravity effect on the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex could provide deeper insights into how microgravity impacts cognitive function and emotional regulation. Additionally, exploring potential therapeutic interventions could provide valuable insights into mitigating the adverse effects of microgravity on astronaut health. Pharmacological treatments that target specific pathways affected by microgravity, such as immune or endocrine signaling, could also help maintain health during long-term space missions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion In summary, our research underscored that 3D clinostat model exerted profound effects on the behavior, metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Compared to hindlimb unloading model, the 3D clinostat model demonstrates a closer resemblance to the brain transcriptome expression profiles observed in spaceflight animals, thereby offering a novel and invaluable research tool for simulating microgravity effect on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 11833055 PMID: 39962314 Abstract A study was conducted to evaluate the three-dimensional clinostat simulated microgravity effect on mouse models, focusing on the central nervous system. Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional changes in space.

In long-term space flight, astronauts face many problems. One of them is the reduction of gravitational force. Terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and long-term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological changes1. Numerous studies have shown that long-term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and nervous system2. Prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. One of the crucial issues is the impact of long-term spaceflight on brain function. Studies have shown that astronauts experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment3. The high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. Currently, tail-suspension hindlimb unloading is the most classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system4. However, this model has certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal. Besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption5. Three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device that generates multi-directional G forces. By controlling the rotation on both axes, it can offset the cumulative gravity vector at the center of the device6. Previous studies have shown that 3D clinostat have been widely used on plants, cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to simulate microgravity effects7–9. Our previous studies suggest that the central nervous system probably changed in mice trained with 3D clinostat10. Therefore, the aim of our work is to systematically assess 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice by behavioral and multi group analysis, focusing on the changes in central nervous system and cognitive function.Methods Mice and treatment 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd and kept in the experimental room at temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 40 ± 5%, under a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) MC group with mice housed in ordinary cage (MC, n = 6); (2) SB group with mice housed in survival box (SB, n = 6); (3) CS group with mice housed in survival box receiving 3D clinostat treatment (CS, n = 6). The structure of the 3D clinostat and the survival box (shown in Supplementary Figure S1) has been described in detail in our previous study10. The rotation modes are as follows: random rotation speed, 0–10 rpm; speed resolution, 0.1 rpm. Before the study, all mice were acclimated to the facility environment for 2 days and then adaptive training was carried out for 5 days to alleviate stress and adapt to the jelly like diet containing 59% water, 1% agar, and 40% purified feed. During training, the CS group underwent adaptive rotation for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h each day, while the MC group was always placed in ordinary cage and the SB group was always placed in survival boxes without any treatment. The formal experiments began at 11 weeks old. The CS group experienced continuous simulated microgravity effect on clinostat for 8 weeks with the exception of cleaning cages and changing food for approximately 20 min per day; the other two groups of mice always lived in corresponding living facilities in the same room. To avoid the interference of acute stress, weight monitoring showed that the body weight of mice in the CS group gradually returned to the control group level after 28 days, suggesting that the mice had fully adapted to the 3D clinostat. Starting from the fifth week, mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments. Following each behavioral experiment, the mice were promptly placed into a 3D clinostat to ensure continuous microgravity effect stimulation. After 8 weeks, the mice were euthanized dissected for sampling at the end of the experiment (Fig. 1a). Animal care was provided in accordance with institutional guidelines and all animal studies were performed in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Laboratory of Animal Science of Peking Union Medical College (IACUC-20220415).

The data are presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n = 6 for each group.Mouse behavioral tests The sequence of the behavioral experiments was arranged as follows: Grip strength experiment (day 29), Open field test (day 30), Novel object recognition test (day 30–32), Y-Maze (day 33), Elevated plus maze (day 34), Tail suspension test (day 35), Gait analysis (day 36–40), Rotarod test (day 42–44), Morris water maze (day 45–51), Forced swim test (day 52) and Fear conditioning test (day 53–56). Each mouse was tested individually and then put back into the 3D clinostat as soon as possible after the test to minimize the time spent disengaging from the rotation. Detailed methods of behavioral testing are as follows: Grip strength experiment The evaluation of grip strength was conducted using a grip strength meter. Each animal was individually placed on the grip strength board and pulled by the tail, prompting them to grasp the bar. The rodents instinctively grasp anything in order to prevent this involuntary backward movement until the pulling force exceeds their grip strength. The maximum value of grip strength was recorded using the Bioseb system. Each animal was tested three times repeatedly, and the mean value was calculated. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 15 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Open field test The open field was an empty square environment, with a size of 50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm. A central area was marked in the open field, centered in the middle of the empty space, with a square length of 16 cm zone. The fringe area was 10 cm wide. The animals were placed in the middle of the central area and observed for five minutes. Behavioral parameters including velocity, distance traveled, and time spent in the central and fringe areas were recorded by a computerized video tracking system (Ethovision XT; Noldus, Information Technology, The Netherlands). The open field apparatus was cleaned after each session using 70% ethanol and allowed to dry between tests. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Novel object recognition test The novel object recognition test was used to assess short- and long-term recognition memory. The experimental procedure consisted of three stages. On the first day, there was an adaptation period without any toy bricks. On the second day, familiarization took place with two toy bricks (2 cm × 2 cm) in opposite corners, both with the same shape, size, and color. On the third day, the test period occurred, with one of the toy bricks changed to a different shape and color. The camera on top of the box was used to record how long it took for a mouse to examine the new object (TN) and the familiar object (TF), allowing a total of five minutes for exploring the two distinct objects. The recognition index was calculated as follows: Recognition index = (TN/(TN + TF)) × 100%. A higher recognition index reflected better short- and long-term recognition memory abilities in animals within this group. The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Y-maze In the Y-maze test, each mouse was placed at the end of one arm of the 'Y' and allowed to explore the maze freely for five minutes. The sequence of entry of the mice in the arms was recorded to calculate the percentage of change. The mouse entered three different arms in turn, which was counted as one alternation. Spontaneous alternations (%) = Number of spontaneous alternations/(Total number of arm entries − 2) *100%. Higher spontaneous alternations indicated better learning and memory ability. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Elevated plus maze During the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test, the maze was composed of four arms (30 cm × 5 cm). Two opposite arms were closed, enclosed by lateral walls (depth 5 cm), and the remaining two arms were open and lacked walls. The four arms were connected by a central area (5 cm × 5 cm), and the maze was elevated 50 cm from the floor. During the test, mice were placed on the central square platform and allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. The following parameters were recorded and analyzed: the number of entries into open/closed arms, the time spent in the open/closed arms, and the total number of arm entries. These data were recorded by a camera and analyzed using a computerized video tracking system. The anxiety index was calculated as the ratio of open arm time and entries to total time and total entries. The open arm entries percent was calculated as entries into the open arm divided by the total number of arm entries (entries into the open arm + entries into the closed arm). During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Tail suspension test The Tail Suspension Test was performed as previously described11. Adhesive tape was applied to the tail, approximately 1 cm from the tip, and the mouse was suspended for 6 min. After a 2 min habituation period, the immobility time was recorded during the final 4 min using Tail Suspension Real-Time Analysis (System-2.0). During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Gait analysis The gait of naturally moving mice was analyzed using CatWalk XT (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands), as previously described12. This gait analysis system consists of a glass walkway floor illuminated with a green light that is completely internally reflected in the glass, a standard charge-coupled device (CCD) camera underneath, and software for recording and analyzing the data obtained from mouse paws. A darkroom box was used at the end of the walkway to create an incentive for the mice to cross the field, where the entrance to their home cage is placed. The mice were placed in the front of the start zone of the walkway and were trained to cross the walkway with five accomplished runs per day on five consecutive days. The test was started on the fifth day, and each mouse was tested three times. The successful run was defined as a mouse walking across the runway without any hesitation. The walkway was cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol between each animal. Gait parameters of footprints were automatically generated (left front, LF; left hind, LH; right front, RF; and right hind, RH). The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Rotarod test The rotarod apparatus (Model: 47600, Italy) was used to assess the locomotor abilities of rodents, particularly their coordination and endurance. Mice were subjected to a training session of four trials per day for 3 days, the rotarod gradually accelerated from 5 to 40 rpm within 120 s until the mouse fell off. Starting from the 4th day after training, formal testing experiments were conducted. During test trial, the rotarod gradually accelerated from 5 to 40 rpm within 300 s. The latency at which the mouse fell from the rod (or a maximum of 5 min) was recorded. The average latency from three trials was determined. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 30 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Morris water maze The water maze was divided into four quadrants and contained a platform that remained submerged under 1–1.5 cm of water. During the training trials, mice were placed in the water from the opposite quadrant of the platform. Successful navigation to the platform was considered when the mouse found it within 1 min. If the mouse failed to find the platform within this time limit, a guidance rod was used to guide the mouse to stay on the platform for 10 s and the latency was recorded as 60 s. Training trials were conducted for three trial sessions each day for six consecutive days. During probe trials, the platform was removed from the maze. Frequency of visits to the platform, time spent in the platform quadrant, cumulative duration in the target zone, and latency to the platform were used as indicators of memory performance. The behavioral test time was about 30 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Forced swim test The forced swim test was performed as previous studies13. Each mouse was individually placed into a non-transparent cylindrical plastic container (height of 25 cm; diameter of 18 cm) containing 15 cm of water at 23–25 °C. The test duration was 6 min, and immobility was analyzed during the last 4 min. Immobility behavior was considered by inactive time when the animal remained floating passively without any movements, with the exception of minimal movements to keep the head above water. During the behavioral testing time, each mouse was removed from the 3D clinostat device for about 20 min for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat device after testing.Fear conditioning test Both contextual and cued fear conditioning protocols were implemented as previous studies14. On the first day, mice were introduced to a Plexiglas training cage under constant illumination for 5 min. On the second day, animals were allowed to adapt for 180 s in the box before commencing three to five rounds of circulation training. Auditory stimulation (30 s, 5 kHz, 70 dB) was then administered, followed by the delivery of electric current stimulation (0.65 mA, 1 s). The intervals between each training session were 30–60 s. Animals were allowed to remain in the cage for 30 s before being returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, a contextual fear conditioning test was conducted by placing animals back into the same training cage without any sound or electric current stimulation, and their freezing behavior was recorded over a 330 s period. On the fourth day, cued fear conditioning began. The background and smell of the boxes were changed, and after 180 s of adaptation in the box, only auditory stimulation (5 kHz, 70 dB) was presented. Freezing behavior was then recorded over a 420 s period. Prior to each animal’s placement, the fear-conditioning box was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. The behavioral test time was about 20 min per day for each mouse to be removed from the 3D clinostat for testing, and then quickly returned to the 3D clinostat after testing.Brain transcriptomics Brain samples were bisected along the plane separating the hemispheres. For each brain, one hemisphere was selected for the generation of mRNA sequencing data, following a methodology similar to that described in the previously published paper15. Total RNA extraction was carried out using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. To assess the quality and quantity of the extracted RNA, the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) was employed. The integrity of the RNA was then evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Subsequently, RNA libraries were constructed with the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit, strictly adhering to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transcriptome sequencing and subsequent analysis were conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads. The raw reads in fastq format underwent an initial processing step using fastp. During this process, low-quality reads were filtered out to obtain clean reads suitable for further analysis. The clean reads were then mapped to the reference genome using HISAT2. To quantify gene expression levels, the FPKM of each gene was calculated and the read counts for each gene were obtained via HTSeq-count. To evaluate the biological duplication of the samples, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the R programming language (version 3.2.0). For the differential expression analysis, the DESeq2 package was utilized. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed if they met the criteria of a P value < 0.05 and a fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.667. Bioinformatic analysis and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at https://cloud.oebiotech.com/task/. The hindlimb unloading mice and real spaceflight microgravity mice brain transcriptome data have been sourced from published data. Specifically, the brain RNA-seq data of hindlimb unloading mice, which underwent hindlimb unloading for 2 weeks and had their total RNA extracted from each brain using Trizol for transcriptome analysis (GeneLab ID: GLDS-32, 10.26030/jpyz-fn46), and the data from spaceflight mice, that were housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days, euthanized in space (mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine and subjected to cardiac puncture followed by cervical dislocation), and had their whole carcasses stored at − 80 °C during the Rodent Research-3 mission (GeneLab ID: GLDS-352, 10.26030/jm59-zy54), are both accessible within the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio). Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2. P value < 0.05 and foldchange > 1.5 or foldchange < 0.667 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expression gene. Bioinformatic analysis and graphics was performed using the OECloud tools at https://cloud.oebiotech.com/task/. To compare the differences between three models, namely the 3D clinostat model (CS), hindlimb unloading model (HU), and space flight mice (FL), we conducted a distance comparison of transcriptome changes. Select shared genes from transcriptome data for analysis, and obtain log2FoldChang values for each gene, namely FCCS(1,2,3…n), FCHU(1,2,3…n), FCFL(1,2,3…n), and then calculate the brain transcriptome distance between each model, SCS/FL = , SHU/FL = , SCS/HU = . The similarity of the three models can be compared by the magnitude of the distance value S. By utilizing the multiple expression changes of each gene in different models relative to their respective control groups, a heatmap can be drawn to visually display and compare the differences in the brain transcriptome of each model.Serum metabolomics To extract metabolites, 400 μl of cold extraction solvent methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:2:1) was added to 100 μl of serum sample and adequately vortexed. The samples were then incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For LC–MS analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in 100 μL acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) solvent and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C for 15 min, then the supernatant was injected. For the untargeted metabolomics of polar metabolites, extracts were analyzed using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Sciex Triple TOF 6600) coupled to hydrophilic interaction chromatography via electrospray ionization by the Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. Ltd. Preparation of QC samples by mixing aliquots of all samples. The raw LC–MS data obtained were processed using Proqenesis QI Software (Waters Corporation Milford, USA). For statistical analysis, we made use of both univariate (Student’s t-test and fold change analysis) and multivariate (principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) method. The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores > 1 and P values < 0.05, and fold change > 2 or < 0.5 were used to filter the differential metabolites. For the KEGG annotation of metabolic pathways, the metabolites were compared against the online KEGG database using BLAST to retrieve their COs, and then mapped to the corresponding KEGG pathways16–18.Analysis of the diversity of gut microbiota in feces OE biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) conducted the 16S amplicon sequencing and analysis. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and its concentration and purity were assessed by NanoDrop 2000 (Agilent, USA). The extracted DNA was used as template for PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA with universal primers for V3-V4 variable regions. Sequencing was performed by Illuminaa NovaSeq 6000 with 250 bp paired-end reads. The raw sequencing data, in FASTQ format, were preprocessed using Cutadapt software to remove adapters. Following trimming, low-quality sequences were filtered out, and the remaining reads were denoised, merged, and chimera-checked using DADA2 with default QIIME2 parameters. The software ultimately output representative reads and an ASV abundance table. The representative read of each ASV was selected using the QIIME2 package, and all representative reads were annotated against the Silva database using q2-feature-classifier.Micro-CT imaging of bone The femoral bone was dissected of soft tissues, fixed in formalin and the distal metaphysis scanned with a Siemens INVEON scanner using the following settings: tube voltage, 60 kV; tube current, 400 µA; and exposure time, 800 ms over 360° rotation. The Feldkamp filtered back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct the images to generate 3D reconstructions. Images acquired from the scanner were viewed and calculated morphometric parameters with INVEON Workplace software.Statistical analysis The data are shown as means ± SD. GraphPad Prism 10.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc test evaluated the significance of differences between groups. A difference was considered significant if the P value < 0.05.Results Effects of 3D clinostat on the body weight and general status in mice Figure 1b showed the daily changes in weight of mice over the first 4 weeks. The SB group mice exhibited a weight profile similar to that of the MC group, indicating good adaptability to survival box. In contrast, the CS group mice undergoing 3D clinostat initially experienced a significant weight loss during the first 4 days. However, these mice gradually adapted to the 3D clinostat and their weight stabilized, followed by a slow recovery to levels similar to those of the SB control group and MC control group. Overall, the mice appeared healthy throughout the study period, indicating good adaptability to the 3D clinostat instrument.The impact of 3D clinostat on cognitive and motor related behavior We conducted a series of behavioral experiments to observe the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect on cognitive and motor related behaviors in mice. The results showed 3D clinostat treatment significantly reduced mice activity and exploratory desire, indicated by the significant reduction in movement distance and exercise time in the open field test as shown in Fig. 1c–d, as well as in other behavioral experiments, including Y Maze, elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test (data not shown). In terms of learning and memory, there were no statistically significant differences in the recognition index in novel object recognition test (Fig. 1e), the spontaneous alternations index in the Y maze (Fig. 1f), and the latency to the platform in the Morris water maze (Fig. 1g) between CS and SB group, suggesting that 3D clinostat did not have a significant impact on the learning and memory. Regarding motor ability, a series of tests including grip strength test, rotarod test, and gait analysis were conducted. The results of the grip strength test revealed no notable differences among the three groups of mice (Fig. 2a). In the rotarod test, mice in the SB group exhibited a significantly shorter latency to fall compared to those in the MC group. This shorter latency may be attributed to the restricted activity space within the survival box for the SB group mice. Conversely, the CS group mice displayed a significantly longer latency to fall compared to the SB group, potentially due to their gradually acquired balancing ability through the 3D clinostat process (Fig. 2b). Besides, gait analysis revealed significant changes in certain gait parameters in the CS group compared to the SB group, indicating that prolonged exposure to the 3D clinostat had a notable impact on the vestibular balance system (Table 1, with the raw data shown in Supplementary Table S1). In terms of anxiety and depression, we conducted a series of experiments including the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and elevated plus maze. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups of mice in terms of the duration of immobility in both the forced swim test and tail suspension test, as well as the percentage of open arm entries in the elevated plus maze. These findings suggest that exposure to the 3D clinostat did not result in significant depression or anxiety tendencies (Fig. 2, c-e). However, in the fear conditioning test, the 3D clinostat seemed to induce a trend towards increased sensitivity to fear behavior and enhanced fear memory. During the fear memory learning phase, the CS group mice exhibited a notable increase in freezing rates (Fig. 2f), coupled with a tendency of increased freezing rates in the contextual memory phase (Fig. 2g). Especially during the extinction phase, CS mice still demonstrated a significant increase in freezing rate, indicating enhanced fear memory and weakened extinction (Fig. 2h). Additionally, an increasing trend in freezing rate was also observed in the CS group mice during the subsequent sound stimulus phase (Fig. 2i). Upon comprehensive analysis of the behavioral research, it can be concluded that the 3D clinostat did not exert a notable influence on learning and memory processes. However, it potentially influenced the fear behavioral, along with subtle alterations related to motor balance. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Behavioral test results.

The results revealed that both SB and CS group of mice exhibited significant bone loss compared to the MC group, with a notable decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, as well as a significant increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation. Furthermore, compared to the SB group, the CS group displayed a trend of further aggravating bone loss (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Changes in femoral bone parameters by micro-CT scanning.

MC: ordinary cage control group; SB: survival box control group; CS: 3D clinostat model group. The data are presented as the mean ± SD, *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, n = 6 for each group.The impact of 3D clinostat on brain transcriptome To evaluate the impact of 3D clinostat on the central nervous system, we conducted whole brain transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that there were 568, 320, and 426 significantly different genes between each group respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a. Figure 4b displays a heatmap of gene expression among the three groups for 320 genes that exhibited significant differences between the CS and SB groups. To further analyze the impact of 3D clinostat on the brain, we conducted KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes, as shown in Fig. 4 c. 3D clinostat may primarily affect immune and endocrine-related signaling pathways, such as those associated with human diseases like Malaria, African trypanosomiasis, Autoimmune thyroid disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and Staphylococcus aureus infection, as well as GnRH secretion and signaling pathway, Ovarian steroidogenesis, IL17 signaling pathway, Prolactin signaling pathway, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, PPAR signaling pathway, and Neutrophil extracellular trap formation.

MC: ordinary cage control group; SB: survival box control group; CS: 3D clinostat model group.The impact of 3D clinostat on serum metabolomics To investigate the systemic effects of the 3D clinostat on mice, we conducted a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples. This experiment yielded a total of 15,470 detected substances, among which 1431 were annotated as known metabolic molecules. OPLS-DA analysis revealed distinct differentiation among the three groups (Fig. 4d). Notably, in comparison to the SB group, the CS group exhibited significant upregulation of serum metabolites such as Lys-Leu, 2-keto-D-Gluconic acid, Thyroxine 4’-o-.beta.-d-glucuronide, Beta-octylglucoside, Demissidine, Pro-Trp, and Pentobarbital. Conversely, serum metabolites including Poricoic acid a, L-Lysine, Oleic acid, Ile-Pro, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-n,n-dimethyl, Niacinamide, and 1-(1z-octadecenyl)-2-(4z,7z,10z,13z,16z,19z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were significantly downregulated (Fig. 4e). These alterations primarily implicate pathways such as ABC transporters, Sphingolipid signaling pathway and metabolism, Biotin metabolism, and the Pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 4f).The impact of 3D clinostat on microbiome To investigate the impact of 3D clinostat on the gastrointestinal microbiota, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on mouse feces samples, revealing 333 ± 23, 273 ± 36, and 267 ± 43 ASVs detected in each group, respectively. In terms of alpha diversity, the fecal microbiota richness was observed to be higher in the MC group compared to the SB and CS groups (Fig. 5b). However, no significant differences were observed in the Shannon index among the three groups (Fig. 5c). Regarding beta diversity, PCA analysis demonstrated distinct segregation of the fecal microbiota profiles among the three groups (Fig. 5a). At the genus level, Fig. 6d illustrated the top 10 differentially abundant bacterial genera among the three groups. Notably, the Bacteroides and Turicibacter were significantly reduced in the CS group compared to both the SB and MC groups (Fig. 5d). Functional analysis of the microbial community was conducted using the PICRUSt2 software. The results indicated significant differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups, specifically in Ferroptosis, PPAR signaling pathway, Lysosome, Glycosaminoglycan degradation, Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and Other glycan degradation (Fig. 5e). These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of 3D clinostat on the composition and functional properties of the gastrointestinal microbiota, suggesting potential implications for host health.

To comprehensively assess the validity of the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect model, we conducted a comparative analysis of mRNA expression profiles in brain tissue, juxtaposing our findings with those derived from literature on hindlimb unloading (HU) mice and spaceflight (FL) mice models. The study revealed minimal overlap among the three models, underscoring substantial variations. Specifically, eight differentially expressed genes (Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1) were shared between the CS and FL models, whereas only two genes (Serpinc1 and Ccl19) overlapped between the HU and FL models. Notably, no shared differentially expressed genes were identified between the CS and HU models, highlighting notable disparities between these two models (Fig. 6a). These findings imply that neither the CS nor the HU model perfectly recapitulates the complex effects of actual space microgravity on the brain, albeit the CS model demonstrates relatively greater fidelity compared to the HU model. With respect to the functional disparities among genes, the HU model predominantly features genes tied to neurodegenerative disorders, whereas the FL model encompassed a diverse array of genes related to immunity, endocrinology, cardiovascular functions, and beyond. Among the top 20 KEGG pathways, the GnRH signaling pathway stands out as a significantly altered pathway across all three models, highlighted in red. Notably, the CS and FL models share additional two commonly altered pathways: Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and Ovarian steroidogenesis, both denoted with blue. Furthermore, Diabetic cardiomyopathy, indicated with green, emerges as a shared altered pathway between the CS and HU models. These observations imply that the CS model exhibited a greater degree of similarity to the FL model in comparison to the HU model (Fig. 6b–c). To compare the differences in brain gene expression profiles across these three models, we performed a comprehensive distance comparison involving 5687 genes that were consistently detected in all models. The results of this analysis are as follows: SCS/FL = , SHU/FL = , and SCS/HU = . Notably, the SCS/FL distance emerges as significantly smaller than the SHU/FL distance, underscoring the closer resemblance of the CS model to the FL model in terms of gene expression patterns. Additionally, by generating a heatmap that visualizes the expression levels of 131 genes commonly detected in all three models and fulfilling the criteria of differential expression (P value < 0.05 and and foldchange > 2 or foldchange < 0.5) in at least one model, it becomes strikingly apparent that the CS model demonstrates a superior performance compared to the HU model (Fig. 6d).Discussion This study explored the impact of simulated microgravity effect using a 3D clinostat on mice, with a particular focus on behavioral, metabolic, gut microbiome and brain transcriptome changes. Our findings revealed that the simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3D clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the central nervous system. This model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying spaceflight-related health risks. In this study, the behavioral experiments demonstrated that the 3D clinostat had a significant impact on the physical activity and exploratory behavior. The observed reduction in movement distance and exercise time in the open field test, combined with similar findings in the Y Maze, elevated plus maze, and novel object recognition tests, suggests a marked decrease in the overall motivation and exploratory drive. These results are consistent with existing literature on the effects of microgravity, where diminished activity levels and altered behavioral patterns have been reported19–21. For instance, mice displayed similar declines in exploratory behavior after a 30-day spaceflight on Bion-M1 satellite21. Different from past results, we did not find obvious anxiety or depression in mice20,22,23. It is known that chronic restraint can lead to anxiety and depression24. We speculate that the anxiety or depression emotion of animals found in the HU model might be caused by tail suspension and restraint, rather than the direct effect of microgravity. The absence of notable disparities in learning and memory between the CS and SB groups, as assessed by the Morris water maze and other memory related tests, might initially seem surprising. One would expect that the reduced physical activity and altered emotional states might extend to cognitive functions. However, the results suggest that the impact of microgravity on cognition might be more complex, potentially involving compensatory mechanisms that preserve cognitive abilities despite changes in other behavioral domains. This finding aligns with studies in which astronauts, despite experiencing emotional and physical stressors, often maintain cognitive performance during space missions, possibly due to intensive training and adaptation processes25. In fact, there are indeed some controversies about the effects of microgravity on cognitive function25–27. During spaceflights, the overall cognitive performance of astronauts does not show significant decline, but their cognitive function declines notably after returning to Earth25. Wollseiffen et al. found that neurocognitive performance can even be improved during short-term microgravity, thus suspecting that cognitive impairment is caused by the combined effects of complex spaceflight stressors rather than microgravity itself28. The adaptive changes such as changes in brain blood supply caused by re-adaptation to the gravitational environment after the flight, rather than microgravity itself, may be the key factors that lead to changes in cognitive function. Besides, it is also possible that the short duration of microgravity effect exposure in our study was insufficient to produce detectable cognitive deficits. Future studies with prolonged exposure and more sensitive cognitive assessments might reveal subtle impairments not captured in this study. The motor coordination and balance tests, such as the rotarod and gait analysis, indicated subtle yet significant changes in the vestibular system of the mice. These alterations are particularly relevant given the well-documented vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during and after space missions29. The role of vestibular system in spatial orientation and balance is crucial, and its disruption in microgravity can lead to disorientation, dizziness, and impaired motor function30. Under the premise that there was no significant change in grip strength, our findings indicated that the latency to fall in the rotarod test for CS group was increased compared to SB group, suggesting an adaptation or learning process that may mimic the vestibular compensation observed in astronauts. This adaptive response could be due to the continuous 3D clinostat environment, which might induce a reorganization of neural circuits involved in balance and coordination. Interestingly, the fear conditioning test showed that the 3D clinostat treated mice exhibited an increased sensitivity to fear stimuli and enhanced fear memory. This observation might be linked to changes in the amygdala and related brain structures, which are critical for processing fear and stress responses31. Research on rats has revealed significant alterations in amygdala neural activity after landing, marked by Fos-positive cells, suggesting a potential impact on fear-related emotional responses32,33. In 15 days of –6° head-down bed rest, volunteers showed temporal overestimation of the fear stimuli in the middle phase34. This finding has important implications for understanding the psychological and emotional challenges faced by astronauts during long-term space missions, where prolonged exposure to microgravity could exacerbate stress and anxiety, potentially impairing mission performance and well-being. In the conditioned fear experiment, the most significant difference between the CS and SB groups occurred during the fear extinction phase, suggesting an attenuation of fear memory extinction. The specific neural circuit mechanisms underlying this phenomenon require further in-depth research. In terms of bone density, mice in the CS group exhibited a decrease in bone volume and trabecular number, accompanied by a notable increase in trabecular pattern factor and trabecular separation, indicating bone loss changes, when compared to the MC control group. However, despite a seemingly more pronounced tendency towards bone loss in the CS group compared to the SB group, no statistically significant difference was observed. This may be attributed to the enhanced gripping and limb loading during the 3D clinostat process, as the mice attempted to counteract the body repositioning caused by the rotation. In the rotarod test, the prolonged fall latency observed in mice from the CS group, as well as subtle gait alterations detected in gait analysis, may also be associated with the similar underlying reasons. On the other hand, the restricted space within the survival box likely constrained the motor abilities of the SB group mice, and simultaneously induced bone loss in these mice. This could potentially account for the reduced difference between the CS and SB groups, representing another plausible explanation. The transcriptomic analysis of the brain tissues revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with immune response, endocrine signaling, and nervous system functions. These alterations suggested that the simulated microgravity effect triggered a broad and complex biological response, affecting multiple systems that are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and health. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances in response to microgravity in spaceflight animal models35,36. Immune dysregulation and hormonal imbalances could lead to a range of health problems, including increased susceptibility to infections, metabolic disorders, and mental health issues. Effective monitoring and the development of targeted interventions could help mitigate these risks and improve the health of astronauts. One of the key findings of this study is the differential gene expression pattern observed in the CS model compared to the HU and FL models. The minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes between these models highlights the distinct biological effects induced by each type of simulated microgravity effect. Specifically, the CS model appears to more closely mimic the gene expression changes seen in real spaceflight, particularly in terms of immune and endocrine-related pathways. This suggests that the 3D clinostat might be a more accurate and reliable model for studying the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system. The CS and FL models demonstrated a convergent alteration in three KEGG signaling pathways: GnRH signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and Ovarian steroidogenesis, as well as eight common differential genes, including Ibsp, Adam3, Xlr3b, G530011O06Rik, Wdr62, Cd22, Gm4675, and Nusap1. The GnRH signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the hypothalamus, regulating the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Under microgravity conditions, significant changes occur in the endocrine system, which may impact the release of GnRH and the activity of the signaling pathway. This alteration in the GnRH signaling pathway may subsequently lead to fluctuations in sex hormone levels and participate in the regulation of cognition, emotion, and behavior37. The Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction pathway encompasses the intricate interplay between numerous neurotransmitters and hormones (such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and others) and their respective receptors. This interaction is vital for neural transmission, emotional regulation, cognitive functions, and neural plasticity. Microgravity and spaceflight can potentially induce alterations in neural adaptability, as well as changes in the levels and sensitivity of neurotransmitters, which may be linked to the Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Interaction38. The Ovarian Steroidogenesis signaling pathway is concerned with the production of estrogen and progesterone. Although ovarian steroidogenesis primarily occurs within the reproductive system, it also exerts significant influence on the brain, particularly in regulating emotions, cognition, and neural plasticity39. Furthermore, estrogen possesses neuroprotective properties, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal health and function40. Under microgravity conditions, a decrease in estrogen levels may diminish its neuroprotective effects, potentially increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases or cognitive decline. The greater similarity in gene expression profiles between the CS and FL models supports the use of this method as a representative model for spaceflight-induced neurobiological changes. The lack of overlap in differentially expressed genes between the HU and FL models further underscores the limitations of the HU model in replicating the effects of actual spaceflight. While the HU model has been widely used to simulate microgravity effect, particularly for studying muscle atrophy and bone loss, it appears to fall short in accurately modeling the complex changes in brain function induced by real spaceflight41,42. This discrepancy may be due to the localized nature of the HU model, which primarily affects the hindlimbs and may not adequately capture the whole-body effects of microgravity. In contrast, the 3D clinostat model provides a more holistic simulation of microgravity effect, potentially leading to more relevant insights into how spaceflight affects the brain. The HU model demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to alterations in cerebral blood flow, rendering it an appropriate choice for investigating notable cognitive shifts following return from spaceflight, while the 3D clinostat model is more likely to focus on subtle cognitive changes caused by adaptation to microgravity in space, which may be related to vestibular function and spatial orientation. The metabolomic analysis of serum samples provided additional insights into the systemic effects of 3D clinostat model. The observed alterations in various metabolic pathways, including ABC transporters, Sphingolipid signaling, and the Pentose phosphate pathway, suggest that microgravity effect disrupts lipid metabolism, energy production, and cellular signaling processes. The downregulation of key metabolites such as L-Lysine, oleic acid, and niacinamide points to potential deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could exacerbate the stress response and impair overall health. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid involved in protein synthesis, while oleic acid is a major component of membrane phospholipids and has anti-inflammatory properties43. Niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, is crucial for energy production and DNA repair44,45. The reduction in these metabolites suggests that microgravity might lead to nutritional imbalances that could have far-reaching effects on health. The microbiome analysis further supports these findings, showing significant alterations in gut microbiota composition, particularly the reduction in Bacteroides and Turicibacter. The reduction in Bacteroides is consistent with the reported elevation of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the intestinal flora of astronauts during spaceflights25. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in regulating immune function, metabolism, and overall health, and its disruption could have serious consequences during spaceflight. Previous studies have shown that changes in the gut microbiota can lead to a range of health issues, including immune dysregulation, metabolic disorders, and even mental health problems45. The observed changes in the gut microbiota in this study suggest that simulated microgravity effect may lead to similar health challenges, emphasizing the need for strategies to maintain gut health during long-term space missions. The functional analysis of the microbial community revealed significant differences in KEGG signaling pathways between the CS and SB groups. Pathways such as Ferroptosis, PPAR signaling, and Glycosaminoglycan degradation were notably affected, indicating potential alterations in cellular death processes, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These changes could have implications for tissue integrity and function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, which is highly sensitive to environmental stressors46. The disruption of these pathways could contribute to the gastrointestinal problems of astronauts, such as increased gut permeability, altered bowel habits and increased susceptibility to infections47. The alterations in gut microbiota composition observed in this study also suggest that dietary interventions or probiotics could be explored as potential strategies to maintain gut health during space missions. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the health risks associated with long-term spaceflight. The 3D clinostat model offers a practical and cost-effective method for simulating microgravity effect on Earth, allowing for the systematic study of its effects on various physiological systems. The results suggest that microgravity may have a more pronounced impact on emotional and motivational states than on cognitive functions, highlighting the need for further research into the psychological well-being of astronauts during extended missions. While our study provided important insights into the 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, although some behavioral changes were observed, many of them did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the relatively small sample size in the study, leading to the possibility that subtle behavioral changes might have been overlooked. Secondly, in space environments, males and females exhibit gender-specific differences in the responses of various bodily systems. This study exclusively used male mice; however, considering the impact of gender factors, it is a scientifically valuable question worth further investigation to determine whether female mice exhibit different responses to the 3D clinostat. Furthermore, we noted significant differences in multiple behavioral indicators, as well as in the transcriptome and metabolome, between mice in the survival box control (SB) group compared to ordinary cage control (MC) group, highlighting the crucial impact of social isolation and spatial confinement on the organism. Further analysis of the synergistic effects of microgravity, social isolation, and spatial constraints is a scientific issue worthy of further attention in the next step. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that variability in transcriptome data may be influenced by differences in time points, exposure durations, and collection methodologies employed across clinostat studies, hindlimb unloading experiments, and spaceflight missions. Additionally, although mice spend most of their time inactive in the resting chamber of the survival box, they may still be forced to move or perform actions against gravity-direction changes. It is acknowledged that the 3D clinostat and hindlimb unloading models do not truly simulate microgravity in a strict physical sense. The 3D clinostat creates a condition where the gravity orientation continuously changes, and the hindlimb unloading model provides mechanical unloading. However, our study focuses on the biological effects that resemble those under microgravity conditions. The data from the 3D clinostat—treated mice show changes in behavior, metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Although these changes may be due to the mice’s response to altered gravity orientation rather than actual microgravity, they share similarities with the biological effects observed in spaceflight studies. For instance, the changes in the vestibular system, as indicated by gait analysis, are consistent with the vestibular dysfunctions reported by astronauts during space missions. Similarly, the alterations in immune and endocrine—related signaling pathways in the brain transcriptome are also in line with previous spaceflight—related research. These similarities suggest that the 3D clinostat model can serve as a valuable tool for studying the potential biological consequences of microgravity on Earth. It is important to acknowledge the differences in physical principles between our models and actual spaceflight, and when selecting models, one must be mindful of these differences to ensure that the appropriate animal model is chosen according to the research objectives. Nevertheless, due to the limitations and difficulties of simulating microgravity on Earth, the 3D clinostat mouse model for simulating microgravity is a powerful supplement to the limited ground-based models currently available. The 3D clinostat model provided a more similar simulation of brain gene expression alterations than hindlimb unloading, yet future research is essential to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed behavioral and neurobiological changes, particularly through targeted studies on specific brain regions and molecular pathways. For example, studying the effects of microgravity effect on the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex could provide deeper insights into how microgravity impacts cognitive function and emotional regulation. Additionally, exploring potential therapeutic interventions could provide valuable insights into mitigating the adverse effects of microgravity on astronaut health. Pharmacological treatments that target specific pathways affected by microgravity, such as immune or endocrine signaling, could also help maintain health during long-term space missions.Conclusion In summary, our research underscored that 3D clinostat model exerted profound effects on the behavior, metabolism, microbiome, and brain transcriptome. Compared to hindlimb unloading model, the 3D clinostat model demonstrates a closer resemblance to the brain transcriptome expression profiles observed in spaceflight animals, thereby offering a novel and invaluable research tool for simulating microgravity effect on Earth.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

    "abstract": "Abstract Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies. Keywords: contrast-induced nephropathy, kidney-on-a-chip, acute kidney injury, contrast media",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major health problem that manifests as an abrupt decline in renal function after iodine contrast exposure. CIN is known as the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [1]. CIN contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and prolonged length of hospital stay. Moreover, the rapidly increasing use of computed tomography scans or interventions using contrast agents, such as angiography, is raising concerns regarding CIN. In addition, there are limited options for the prevention and treatment of CIN, including fluid therapy and avoidance of additional nephrotoxins. Potential pathogenic mechanisms of CIN include vasoconstriction, medullary hypoxia, direct cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and increased tubular fluid viscosity [2]. Previous experimental studies have mainly focused on direct tubular toxicity, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress following contrast exposure [3]. Many researchers have linked the physicochemical properties of iodinated contrast materials to CIN. The administered volume, osmolality, and viscosity of contrast media (CM) may be related to nephrotoxicity [4]. Indeed, high-osmolar ionic CM is no longer used because of the high risk of adverse drug reactions and renal toxicity [5]. Currently, two types of contrast agents are widely used in clinical practice: high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) and low-viscosity low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM). IOCM has an osmolality similar to that of blood (290 mOsm/kg), while LOCM has a higher osmolality (600–900 mOsm/kg) than IOCM. Some studies have suggested the superiority of IOCM over LOCM in the prevention of CIN [6,7]. However, there was no difference in the overall risk of CIN according to the type of CM in meta-analyses [8,9]. It still remains unclear which of these two types of CM is better for renal safety. To date, the effect of CM viscosity on renal function has not been fully investigated due to the difficulty in experimental methodology. Accurately controlling and measuring fluid viscosity and shear stress is challenging in conventional experimental designs. Under in vivo conditions, the high viscosity of IOCM can be harmful to renal function. IOCM is further concentrated in the renal medulla with increasing viscosity, particularly in dehydrated individuals, which increases intraluminal pressure and decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [10]. Nevertheless, previous in vitro studies in static conditions showed that LOCM has more cytotoxic effects than IOCM [11]. However, this static condition does not reflect the rheological effects of CM. Given that animal models for CIN are not well established and clinical trials are much harder to implement due to high cost and ethical issues [12], alternative experimental approaches are warranted. In the field of nephrology, organ-on-a-chip technology is gradually being utilized for physiological in vitro disease models [13]. One of the key features of the organ-on-a-chip is the exposure of cells to easily controlled microfluidic conditions, which could enable rheological studies. Therefore, organ-on-a-chip experiments could be an alternative approach to bridge the gap between the in vitro and in vivo findings in CIN. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of the rheological factors of LOCM and IOCM using a kidney-on-a-chip platform.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture and Microfluid Device Human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC; CC-2553, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were purchased and used to evaluate the nephrotoxicity of iodinated CM. RPTEC were cultured in renal epithelial growth medium (REGM CC-3191, Lonza) supplemented with 0.5% FBS (CC-4127, Lonza) and GA-1000 (30 mg/mL gentamicin and 15 µg/mL amphotericin). We used a three-lane OrganoPlate (Mimetas BV, 4003 400B) with a channel width of 400 μm and height of 220 μm to construct three-dimensional tubular structures (Figure 1A). Before cell seeding, 1.6 μL of collagen 1 (AMSbio cultrex, 3447-020-01, 4 mg/mL) was injected into the middle inlet of the chip with 100 mM HEPES (15630, Life Technologies, CA, USA) and 3.7 mg/dL NaHCO3 (S5761, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the chip was subsequently incubated at 37 °C overnight. RPTEC were seeded at 2 × 107/mL into each upper inlet of the plate. To facilitate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, we maintained the inclination of the chip at 70° for 4 h before placement on an interval rocker. RPTEC were perfused at an angle of 7° and at intervals of 8 min using a rocker at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Under our experimental conditions, the cells reached confluence 10 days after rocking perfusion. Before administration of the test solutions, we examined whether the three-dimensional tubular structure was well formed within the chips. Three-dimensional reconstructed fluorescent images revealed a well-demarcated tubular lumen with a confluent epithelial monolayer (Figure 1B). For comparison with static culture conditions, RPTEC was also cultured in 96-well plates without fluid shear stress in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Figure 1.

Chemicals and Reagents The test solutions were IOCM iodixanol (Visipaque 320 mgI/mL, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), LOCM iopromide (Ultravist 300 mgI/mL, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany), 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (viscosity control; Volulyte, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), and 15% mannitol (osmolality control; JW Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea). The characteristic parameters of the test solutions are listed in Table 1. To simulate the urine concentration process, we tested different CM concentrations. The dynamic viscosity of CM specimens according to the preselected iodine concentrations was measured with an SV-10 viscometer (A&D, Japan) at a temperature of 37 °C with three replicates per group. As shown in Figure 2, the viscosity of each contrast agent increased exponentially with iodine concentration. The viscosities of LOCM and IOCM differed substantially at high iodine concentrations. Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) performed according to a standard protocol, and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader (Gemini EM, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were detached from the OrganoPlate using Accutase (A6964, Sigma) and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (9803, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Protein lysates were centrifuged at 14,000× g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein extracts were quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and separated with 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (1704156, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against GAPDH (Santa Cruz, 47724), Akt (Cell Signaling, 9272), phospho-Akt (p-Akt; Ser473; 9271, Cell Signaling), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2; 9102, Cell Signaling), and phospho-Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; 9101, Cell Signaling), followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies (7074 and 7076, Cell Signaling). Each protein band was developed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (34577, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and detected using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Table 1.

Experimental Model In the present study, we investigated CM-induced nephrotoxicity under shear-stress conditions using kidney-on-a-chip models compared to that under static conditions. RPTEC was treated with varying iodine concentrations of IOCM and LOCM, which reflect renal concentrating process. Because IOCM and LOCM have different osmolalities and viscosities, we compared the nephrotoxic effects of each contrast agent in terms of physicochemical stress and performed mathematical simulations. IOCM and LOCM were used to evaluate the effects of high viscosity and osmolality on renal tubular cells, respectively. We tested each experimental group under different shear-stress conditions. Fluid shear-stress in vivo in human proximal tubules is estimated to be 0.1–1 dyn/cm2 [14,15,16]; however, it was applied differently depending on the experimental conditions [17]. In a rectangular pipe-shaped channel of the OrganoPlate, the fluid shear-stress (τ) can be calculated as τ=6µQbh2, where b and h represent the width and height of the channel, respectively, Q represents the flow rate, and μ denotes the fluid viscosity. The fluid shear-stress is approximately 0.13 dyn/cm2 when the rocker is set at an inclination of ±7° and an interval of 8 min [18]. Given that a single nephron glomerular filtrate directly reaches the initial part of the proximal tubule, a single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) can be used for the calculation of shear stress. The SNGFR of healthy adults has been reported to be 80 ± 40 nL/min [19], and the diameter of the proximal tubule has been reported to be ~60 μm [20,21]. The fluid shear-stress at the proximal tubular wall can be calculated as τ=4µQπR2 under the assumption of a laminar, incompressible Newtonian flow of urine filtrate through a cylindrical tube, where R represents the radius of the proximal tubule. Since about 60–70% of the filtered water and sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule [22], fluid shear-stress in the human proximal tubule ranges from approximately 0.44 (initial part) to 0.13 (distal part) dyn/cm2 (at 37 °C), which is comparable to that in the OrganoPlate. CKD is accompanied by a progressive loss of functioning glomeruli in the kidneys. Depending on renal disease, nephron loss induces an increase in the SNGFR of remaining nephrons [23]. These phenomena are particularly observed in post-nephrectomy animal models [24]. To mimic progressive nephron loss, we designed different mean flow rate conditions with varying rocker intervals (8 min, 4 min, and 2 min) applied to the chips. 2.4. Mathematical Simulation Mathematical simulation was performed using Python (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) and gnuplot to examine the flow rate and shear stress in the upper channel of the chip. The test fluids, including iodinated CMs, were regarded as Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity and incompressibility. Parameters such as the dimensions of the OrganoPlate provided by the manufacturer were used. Mass density and dynamic viscosity at 37 °C were used for the calculations. Different viscosities of test fluids and rocking conditions were also considered. The shear stress and fluid flow rate at each time point during a single cycle of rocking were calculated. The time-averaged shear-stress and flow rate were calculated from the average of each value over multiple cycles of bidirectional flows. 2.5. Image and Statistical Analysis Three-dimensional images were reconstructed using the ImageJ software (, USA). Graph plotting and data analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Each experiment was performed and analyzed in triplicate. Differences between experimental groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni t-tests. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Mathematical simulation As the viscosity of CM increased with concentration, the mean flow rate of CM decreased, particularly at high iodine concentrations of more than 200 mg/dL, which was pronounced at 2 min rocking intervals (Figure 3A–C). The flow rate of IOCM was substantially reduced due to its relatively higher viscosity compared to LOCM. The difference in flow rate between IOCM and LOCM was apparent at higher iodine concentrations and shorter rocking intervals (Figure 3D). Notably, the flow rate of IOCM at an iodine concentration of 300 mgI/mL and 2 min intervals was less than half of that of LOCM. Since shear stress is linearly proportional to the product of fluid viscosity and flow rate, the peak shear-stress is theoretically not different between IOCM and LOCM. However, time-averaged shear-stress was greater in IOCM than in LOCM due to the slower fluid flow rate (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). This indicates that IOCM is retained longer than LOCM, which also implies longer exposure to CM-induced nephrotoxicity. In the human kidney, urinary flow is not bidirectional; thus, we additionally examined the shear stress and fluid flow-rate versus time within a single cycle (Figure 3E,F). Depending on the viscosity of the test fluid, time durations of shear stress above 1 dyn/cm2 were 0.23 min (media), 0.67 min (iopromide), and 4.52 min (iodixanol; Figure 3E). Peak flow rates were 48.08 μL/min (media), 24.82 μL/min (iopromide), and 3.82 μL/min (iodixanol; Figure 3F). Iodixanol flows more slowly than iopromide and causes a higher shear-stress for a longer duration. Figure 3.

The concentrations of iodixanol and iopromide were selected on the assumption that IOCM is approximately two times more concentrated than LOCM through the renal tubule. (F) Fluid flow rate during a single cycle of rocking. 3.2. Modeling of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Kidney-on-a-Chip In the static condition, the overall cytotoxicity was higher for both LOCM and IOCM compared to the control (Figure 4). In particular, LOCM showed a marked dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM at concentrations of 100 mgI/mL or higher. This finding was consistent with a previous study [11]. Under shear-stress conditions using bidirectional rocker perfusion at 8 min intervals, there was no difference in cell viability between IOCM and the control across all iodine concentrations. However, LOCM induced greater cytotoxicity than IOCM. LOCM significantly decreased cell viability in the range of 100–250 mgI/mL, with corresponding osmolalities of 393, 447, 501, and 555 mOsm/kg, whereas those of IOCM ranged from 286 to 290 mOsm/kg. These patterns remained unchanged at 4 min rocking intervals; LOCM was more cytotoxic than IOCM at the same range of concentrations. Interestingly, increased cell viability was observed in some high-viscosity experimental groups, such as the HES and IOCM groups. However, at 2 min rocking intervals, there was no difference in cytotoxicity between LOCM and IOCM. Both LOCM and IOCM induced significant cytotoxicity at concentrations of 150 mgI/mL or higher. Mean shear-stress at the ranges showing cytotoxic effects was estimated from 0.89 dyn/cm2 (iodixanol concentration of 150 mgI/mL) to 1.23 dyn/cm2 (iodixanol concentration of 250 mgI/mL) from the mathematical simulation. The corresponding mean flow rate of iodixanol ranged from 8.59 μL/min to 2.09 μL/min. Under the same experimental conditions, we performed Western blot analysis of signaling molecules reported to be associated with CIN, including Erk1/2, and Akt (Figure 5) [25]. During the 8 min rocking interval, LOCM significantly induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, especially at high concentrations. A similar pattern was observed when cells were treated with the high-osmolar agent mannitol. However, there was no change in the expression of these molecules in IOCM groups. This pattern was similar when applying the 2 min rocking interval. LOCM inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in a dose-dependent manner. IOCM did not induce any significant changes in the expression of signaling molecules at any concentration. Figure 4.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion In the present study, we suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using a three-dimensional proximal tubule-on-a-chip. Renal tubular cell injury induced by IOCM and LOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations and shear-stress conditions, which represent urine concentrations depending on the hydration status and SNGFR. The high viscosity of the concentrated IOCM noticeably slowed the tubular flow rate and increased the mean shear-stress levels. We identified significant cytotoxic effects from the increased viscosity of IOCM within a three-dimensionally perfused channel, which was not apparent under low-shear-stress conditions. LOCM was cytotoxic, even under static or low-shear-stress conditions, and the cytotoxicity was possibly mediated by Erk1/2 inactivation. However, nephrotoxicity was comparable between LOCM and IOCM under high-shear-stress conditions. To date, researchers have suggested that the high viscosity of CM is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of CIN. In particular, IOCM has physiological osmolality at the cost of increased viscosity, and thus, its high viscosity could have detrimental effects on the kidney. However, the rheological aspects of CM have not been fully addressed in the pathophysiology of CIN. A previous in vitro study revealed that LOCM is more cytotoxic than IOCM under static conditions, which is inconsistent with clinical data [11]. The implementation of the microenvironment in a single nephron was not feasible using conventional in vitro experiments. The physicochemical properties of CM have been evaluated using indirect methods, such as dialysis [26]. We constructed the CIN-on-a-chip using the OrganoPlate platform, which contains an extracellular matrix and forms a 3D perfused tubular structure, mimicking an in vivo environment [18]. Functional studies of transporters, biomarkers, and gene expression using the OrganoPlate have already been tested and validated [27]. Given that renal tubular epithelial cells are continuously exposed to the fluid shear-stress of urine filtrate [28], kidney-on-a-chip may be an indispensable tool for the rheological study of renal diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on CIN using an organ-on-a-chip platform. Overall, our findings showed nephrotoxic effects of CM under shear-stress conditions which were distinct from those under static conditions. Under static conditions, higher cytotoxicity was observed even at low concentrations of CM compared to that of the control, which is not seen under in vivo conditions and in clinical settings. Since CIN mainly occurs when high-dose CM are used in patients with risk factors [29], our results under shear-stress conditions are more similar to the clinical situations. These findings may indicate the beneficial effects of fluid shear-stress within physiological levels. Shear stress is reported to activate Nrf2 expression in the renal proximal tubules, resulting in a protective role in CIN [30,31]. However, our findings also highlight the critical role of the high viscosity of IOCM in CIN. Increased viscosity of CM could contribute to tubular cell damage through flow-derived stresses such as tubular stretching, increased shear stress, and transmural pressure [32]. Similarly, renal tubular injury in urinary tract obstruction models is also mediated mainly through cellular stretching and altered shear-stress [33]. Fluid shear-stress beyond physiological levels could cause renal epithelial damage. Although the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, there has been some evidence related to the harmful effects of increased shear-stress on the cells. Studies on microfluidic platforms suggest that excessive shear-stress has detrimental effects on cells by detaching or disrupting the cytoskeleton [29,30]. Exposure of HK2 cells to high shear-stress (5 dyne/cm2) for 48 h caused structural derangement, including the loss of tight junctions, adherent junctions, and primary cilia [17]. Therefore, most microfluidic studies with renal tubular epithelial cells have used a physiological shear-stress of 0.2–1 dyn/cm2. As observed in our findings, viscosity-induced cytotoxicity was pronounced at a mean shear-stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. Additionally, a study by Garvin et al. suggested the vital role of tubular cell stretching in producing reactive oxygen species [34], which is a key pathogenesis in CIN. With a typical dose of CM, the plasma concentration is less than 20 mgI/mL [35]. However, CM are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules, and their intraluminal concentration increase along the renal tubules, with a peak concentration up to 100 times higher than that in plasma [36]. IOCM are approximately two times more concentrated due to their lower osmolality, which further exponentially increases urine viscosity (Figure 6A) [26]. In our mathematical simulation, the time constant of exponential decay for the fluid flow-rate is proportional to the fluid viscosity; therefore, it is much greater with IOCM. As a result, IOCM is excreted more slowly than LOCM, exerting high levels of shear stress on the tubular cells for a longer duration (Figure 6B,C). We showed that when assuming that the iodixanol and iopromide concentrations at the corticomedullary junction are 300 mgI/mL and 150 mgI/mL, respectively, the peak flow rate of iodixanol was six times slower than that of iopromide, and the time during which the shear stress level is above 1 dyn/cm2 was also seven times longer with iodixanol than with iopromide. These findings are in line with the results of some in vivo studies that related highly viscous CM to increased tubular pressure, prolonged CM retention, and subsequent decreased GFR and hypoxia [10]. A micropuncture study in rats by Ueda et al. showed that the viscosity of IOCM (iotrolan) was significantly higher than that of other LOCMs with slower urinary excretion [37]. Iotrolan also induced high intratubular hydrostatic pressure for a longer duration than LOCMs [38]. The high viscosity of iodixanol induces prolonged reduction in medullary oxygenation [39], which is a key feature of CIN. Nevertheless, these animal studies require sophisticated techniques and lack reproducibility; thus, similar findings have only been identified in a few studies. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Overview of the proposed models of contrast-induced nephropathy. (A) Iso-osmolar contrast media are twice as concentrated as low-osmolar contrast media and have a much greater viscosity. Data from Jost et al. [26]. The concentration and viscosity of CM are obtained from an in vitro dialysis model using polyethylene glycol solution with different osmolalities (290, 500, and 1000 mOsm/kg, which represents the mean osmolality of the renal cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla, respectively). (B) Overall mechanisms of contrast-induced nephropathy. (C) Comparison of iso-osmolar and low-osmolar contrast media in our model. CM—contrast media; LOCM—low-osmolar contrast media; IOCM—iso-osmolar contrast media; GFR—glomerular filtration rate. Urine viscosity can vary significantly with urine volume, which is closely associated with an individual’s hydration status. The effect of dehydration on renal concentration is more pronounced when using IOCM [10]. We assumed that CM was moderately to highly concentrated in the renal tubules. In addition, given that patients with CKD are at a greater risk of CIN, different shear-stress conditions were investigated to reflect the effect of nephron loss and increased SNGFR. Our findings indirectly showed that highly concentrated CM and nephron loss could contribute to increased shear-stress and renal toxicity, which is consistent with the results of a uninephrectomy mouse model [17]. We treated RPTEC with CM for 24 h, which also reflected the CKD condition. Patients with CKD usually show a longer retention of CM. Cortical retention of CM was observed in patients with CKD 24 h after CM administration, which was more pronounced in patients later diagnosed with CIN [40]. Conventionally, the high osmolality of CM is considered a major determinant of CIN. However, the role of osmolality in CIN pathogenesis has not been clearly determined. Rather, LOCM can confer beneficial effects on tubular cells by inducing osmotic diuresis and subsequently lowering urine viscosity. Indeed, LOCM causes a two-fold higher urine output than IOCM due to osmotic diuresis [41]. In this regard, the higher osmolality of LOCM relative to IOCM may serve as a protective factor against viscosity-induced renal toxicity. Additionally, we evaluated some pathway molecules that have been reported to be linked to CIN. Akt and Erk1/2 are among the molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation [25]. A previous in vitro study of CIN showed that both IOCM and LOCM induced dephosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 [25]. In particular, IOCM caused a greater decrease in p-Erk 1/2 in HK2 cells. However, we revealed that decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was only observed in the LOCM group under shear-stress conditions, and there was no difference in p-Akt levels between groups. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the exact mechanistic pathways of CIN, our findings possibly suggest that osmolar stress is associated with dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 or viscosity-related stress induces the activation of Erk1/2. Mechanical stretching of renal proximal tubular cells activates Erk1/2 signaling [42], and high-osmolar CM diatrizoate causes greater dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 compared to iopromide [43]. Collectively, viscosity-mediated nephrotoxicity was prominent under high shear-stress conditions. We found no difference between IOCM and LOCM under high fluid-shear-stress, which was similar to the clinical data. These findings suggest that the risk of CIN does not differ between IOCM and LOCM in patients with CKD. Even in a study showing a better effect of IOCM on renal toxicity, superiority of IOCM was not significant in the subgroup with lower GFR (<45 or 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [44]. In this context, the kidney-on-a-chip microfluidic platform could be a potential alternative in vitro model, which can provide easier control of various physical parameters. Our study has some limitations. This study highlights the critical role of the rheological effects of CM in terms of tubulodynamics. However, detailed mechanisms that mediate viscosity-induced tubular injury still remain elusive. More sophisticated methodology is warranted to determine the main contributing factors to viscosity-related injury. High viscosity also affects the hemodynamics in peritubular vessels. Therefore, extended microfluidic models combining vascular compartments with tubular counterparts would be useful. In addition, the limitations of the assumptions of the experimental design should be considered. We mathematically regarded the renal tubule as a rigid channel; however, it was highly elastic and deformable. In addition, the bidirectional pulsatile flow used in our model was not the same as the unilateral fluid flow in the renal tubules.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions We demonstrated the application of a three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip model to evaluate the physicochemical factors of CM in CIN. Overall, our CIN model under shear-stress conditions reliably reflected in vivo situations. Our results highlight the role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high-shear-stress conditions and are quite different from the findings of conventional in vitro studies. LOCM showed higher cytotoxicity than IOCM in a dose-dependent manner under physiological shear-stress conditions. However, under high-shear-stress conditions, IOCM caused renal tubular cell damage comparable to that caused by LOCM, decreasing the urine flow rate and exposing cells to high shear-stress for a longer duration.",

Copyright notice ID: 9146534 PMID: 35630155 Abstract Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies. Keywords: contrast-induced nephropathy, kidney-on-a-chip, acute kidney injury, contrast media1. Introduction Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major health problem that manifests as an abrupt decline in renal function after iodine contrast exposure. CIN is known as the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [1]. CIN contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and prolonged length of hospital stay. Moreover, the rapidly increasing use of computed tomography scans or interventions using contrast agents, such as angiography, is raising concerns regarding CIN. In addition, there are limited options for the prevention and treatment of CIN, including fluid therapy and avoidance of additional nephrotoxins. Potential pathogenic mechanisms of CIN include vasoconstriction, medullary hypoxia, direct cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and increased tubular fluid viscosity [2]. Previous experimental studies have mainly focused on direct tubular toxicity, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress following contrast exposure [3]. Many researchers have linked the physicochemical properties of iodinated contrast materials to CIN. The administered volume, osmolality, and viscosity of contrast media (CM) may be related to nephrotoxicity [4]. Indeed, high-osmolar ionic CM is no longer used because of the high risk of adverse drug reactions and renal toxicity [5]. Currently, two types of contrast agents are widely used in clinical practice: high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) and low-viscosity low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM). IOCM has an osmolality similar to that of blood (290 mOsm/kg), while LOCM has a higher osmolality (600–900 mOsm/kg) than IOCM. Some studies have suggested the superiority of IOCM over LOCM in the prevention of CIN [6,7]. However, there was no difference in the overall risk of CIN according to the type of CM in meta-analyses [8,9]. It still remains unclear which of these two types of CM is better for renal safety. To date, the effect of CM viscosity on renal function has not been fully investigated due to the difficulty in experimental methodology. Accurately controlling and measuring fluid viscosity and shear stress is challenging in conventional experimental designs. Under in vivo conditions, the high viscosity of IOCM can be harmful to renal function. IOCM is further concentrated in the renal medulla with increasing viscosity, particularly in dehydrated individuals, which increases intraluminal pressure and decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [10]. Nevertheless, previous in vitro studies in static conditions showed that LOCM has more cytotoxic effects than IOCM [11]. However, this static condition does not reflect the rheological effects of CM. Given that animal models for CIN are not well established and clinical trials are much harder to implement due to high cost and ethical issues [12], alternative experimental approaches are warranted. In the field of nephrology, organ-on-a-chip technology is gradually being utilized for physiological in vitro disease models [13]. One of the key features of the organ-on-a-chip is the exposure of cells to easily controlled microfluidic conditions, which could enable rheological studies. Therefore, organ-on-a-chip experiments could be an alternative approach to bridge the gap between the in vitro and in vivo findings in CIN. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of the rheological factors of LOCM and IOCM using a kidney-on-a-chip platform.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture and Microfluid Device Human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC; CC-2553, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were purchased and used to evaluate the nephrotoxicity of iodinated CM. RPTEC were cultured in renal epithelial growth medium (REGM CC-3191, Lonza) supplemented with 0.5% FBS (CC-4127, Lonza) and GA-1000 (30 mg/mL gentamicin and 15 µg/mL amphotericin). We used a three-lane OrganoPlate (Mimetas BV, 4003 400B) with a channel width of 400 μm and height of 220 μm to construct three-dimensional tubular structures (Figure 1A). Before cell seeding, 1.6 μL of collagen 1 (AMSbio cultrex, 3447-020-01, 4 mg/mL) was injected into the middle inlet of the chip with 100 mM HEPES (15630, Life Technologies, CA, USA) and 3.7 mg/dL NaHCO3 (S5761, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the chip was subsequently incubated at 37 °C overnight. RPTEC were seeded at 2 × 107/mL into each upper inlet of the plate. To facilitate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, we maintained the inclination of the chip at 70° for 4 h before placement on an interval rocker. RPTEC were perfused at an angle of 7° and at intervals of 8 min using a rocker at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Under our experimental conditions, the cells reached confluence 10 days after rocking perfusion. Before administration of the test solutions, we examined whether the three-dimensional tubular structure was well formed within the chips. Three-dimensional reconstructed fluorescent images revealed a well-demarcated tubular lumen with a confluent epithelial monolayer (Figure 1B). For comparison with static culture conditions, RPTEC was also cultured in 96-well plates without fluid shear stress in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Figure 1.

Chemicals and Reagents The test solutions were IOCM iodixanol (Visipaque 320 mgI/mL, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), LOCM iopromide (Ultravist 300 mgI/mL, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany), 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (viscosity control; Volulyte, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), and 15% mannitol (osmolality control; JW Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea). The characteristic parameters of the test solutions are listed in Table 1. To simulate the urine concentration process, we tested different CM concentrations. The dynamic viscosity of CM specimens according to the preselected iodine concentrations was measured with an SV-10 viscometer (A&D, Japan) at a temperature of 37 °C with three replicates per group. As shown in Figure 2, the viscosity of each contrast agent increased exponentially with iodine concentration. The viscosities of LOCM and IOCM differed substantially at high iodine concentrations. Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) performed according to a standard protocol, and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader (Gemini EM, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were detached from the OrganoPlate using Accutase (A6964, Sigma) and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (9803, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Protein lysates were centrifuged at 14,000× g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein extracts were quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and separated with 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (1704156, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against GAPDH (Santa Cruz, 47724), Akt (Cell Signaling, 9272), phospho-Akt (p-Akt; Ser473; 9271, Cell Signaling), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2; 9102, Cell Signaling), and phospho-Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; 9101, Cell Signaling), followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies (7074 and 7076, Cell Signaling). Each protein band was developed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (34577, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and detected using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Table 1.

Experimental Model In the present study, we investigated CM-induced nephrotoxicity under shear-stress conditions using kidney-on-a-chip models compared to that under static conditions. RPTEC was treated with varying iodine concentrations of IOCM and LOCM, which reflect renal concentrating process. Because IOCM and LOCM have different osmolalities and viscosities, we compared the nephrotoxic effects of each contrast agent in terms of physicochemical stress and performed mathematical simulations. IOCM and LOCM were used to evaluate the effects of high viscosity and osmolality on renal tubular cells, respectively. We tested each experimental group under different shear-stress conditions. Fluid shear-stress in vivo in human proximal tubules is estimated to be 0.1–1 dyn/cm2 [14,15,16]; however, it was applied differently depending on the experimental conditions [17]. In a rectangular pipe-shaped channel of the OrganoPlate, the fluid shear-stress (τ) can be calculated as τ=6µQbh2, where b and h represent the width and height of the channel, respectively, Q represents the flow rate, and μ denotes the fluid viscosity. The fluid shear-stress is approximately 0.13 dyn/cm2 when the rocker is set at an inclination of ±7° and an interval of 8 min [18]. Given that a single nephron glomerular filtrate directly reaches the initial part of the proximal tubule, a single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) can be used for the calculation of shear stress. The SNGFR of healthy adults has been reported to be 80 ± 40 nL/min [19], and the diameter of the proximal tubule has been reported to be ~60 μm [20,21]. The fluid shear-stress at the proximal tubular wall can be calculated as τ=4µQπR2 under the assumption of a laminar, incompressible Newtonian flow of urine filtrate through a cylindrical tube, where R represents the radius of the proximal tubule. Since about 60–70% of the filtered water and sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule [22], fluid shear-stress in the human proximal tubule ranges from approximately 0.44 (initial part) to 0.13 (distal part) dyn/cm2 (at 37 °C), which is comparable to that in the OrganoPlate. CKD is accompanied by a progressive loss of functioning glomeruli in the kidneys. Depending on renal disease, nephron loss induces an increase in the SNGFR of remaining nephrons [23]. These phenomena are particularly observed in post-nephrectomy animal models [24]. To mimic progressive nephron loss, we designed different mean flow rate conditions with varying rocker intervals (8 min, 4 min, and 2 min) applied to the chips.2.4. Mathematical Simulation Mathematical simulation was performed using Python (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) and gnuplot to examine the flow rate and shear stress in the upper channel of the chip. The test fluids, including iodinated CMs, were regarded as Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity and incompressibility. Parameters such as the dimensions of the OrganoPlate provided by the manufacturer were used. Mass density and dynamic viscosity at 37 °C were used for the calculations. Different viscosities of test fluids and rocking conditions were also considered. The shear stress and fluid flow rate at each time point during a single cycle of rocking were calculated. The time-averaged shear-stress and flow rate were calculated from the average of each value over multiple cycles of bidirectional flows.2.5. Image and Statistical Analysis Three-dimensional images were reconstructed using the ImageJ software (, USA). Graph plotting and data analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Each experiment was performed and analyzed in triplicate. Differences between experimental groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni t-tests. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.3. Results 3.1. Mathematical simulation As the viscosity of CM increased with concentration, the mean flow rate of CM decreased, particularly at high iodine concentrations of more than 200 mg/dL, which was pronounced at 2 min rocking intervals (Figure 3A–C). The flow rate of IOCM was substantially reduced due to its relatively higher viscosity compared to LOCM. The difference in flow rate between IOCM and LOCM was apparent at higher iodine concentrations and shorter rocking intervals (Figure 3D). Notably, the flow rate of IOCM at an iodine concentration of 300 mgI/mL and 2 min intervals was less than half of that of LOCM. Since shear stress is linearly proportional to the product of fluid viscosity and flow rate, the peak shear-stress is theoretically not different between IOCM and LOCM. However, time-averaged shear-stress was greater in IOCM than in LOCM due to the slower fluid flow rate (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). This indicates that IOCM is retained longer than LOCM, which also implies longer exposure to CM-induced nephrotoxicity. In the human kidney, urinary flow is not bidirectional; thus, we additionally examined the shear stress and fluid flow-rate versus time within a single cycle (Figure 3E,F). Depending on the viscosity of the test fluid, time durations of shear stress above 1 dyn/cm2 were 0.23 min (media), 0.67 min (iopromide), and 4.52 min (iodixanol; Figure 3E). Peak flow rates were 48.08 μL/min (media), 24.82 μL/min (iopromide), and 3.82 μL/min (iodixanol; Figure 3F). Iodixanol flows more slowly than iopromide and causes a higher shear-stress for a longer duration. Figure 3.

(F) Fluid flow rate during a single cycle of rocking.3.2. Modeling of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Kidney-on-a-Chip In the static condition, the overall cytotoxicity was higher for both LOCM and IOCM compared to the control (Figure 4). In particular, LOCM showed a marked dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM at concentrations of 100 mgI/mL or higher. This finding was consistent with a previous study [11]. Under shear-stress conditions using bidirectional rocker perfusion at 8 min intervals, there was no difference in cell viability between IOCM and the control across all iodine concentrations. However, LOCM induced greater cytotoxicity than IOCM. LOCM significantly decreased cell viability in the range of 100–250 mgI/mL, with corresponding osmolalities of 393, 447, 501, and 555 mOsm/kg, whereas those of IOCM ranged from 286 to 290 mOsm/kg. These patterns remained unchanged at 4 min rocking intervals; LOCM was more cytotoxic than IOCM at the same range of concentrations. Interestingly, increased cell viability was observed in some high-viscosity experimental groups, such as the HES and IOCM groups. However, at 2 min rocking intervals, there was no difference in cytotoxicity between LOCM and IOCM. Both LOCM and IOCM induced significant cytotoxicity at concentrations of 150 mgI/mL or higher. Mean shear-stress at the ranges showing cytotoxic effects was estimated from 0.89 dyn/cm2 (iodixanol concentration of 150 mgI/mL) to 1.23 dyn/cm2 (iodixanol concentration of 250 mgI/mL) from the mathematical simulation. The corresponding mean flow rate of iodixanol ranged from 8.59 μL/min to 2.09 μL/min. Under the same experimental conditions, we performed Western blot analysis of signaling molecules reported to be associated with CIN, including Erk1/2, and Akt (Figure 5) [25]. During the 8 min rocking interval, LOCM significantly induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, especially at high concentrations. A similar pattern was observed when cells were treated with the high-osmolar agent mannitol. However, there was no change in the expression of these molecules in IOCM groups. This pattern was similar when applying the 2 min rocking interval. LOCM inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in a dose-dependent manner. IOCM did not induce any significant changes in the expression of signaling molecules at any concentration. Figure 4.

Discussion In the present study, we suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using a three-dimensional proximal tubule-on-a-chip. Renal tubular cell injury induced by IOCM and LOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations and shear-stress conditions, which represent urine concentrations depending on the hydration status and SNGFR. The high viscosity of the concentrated IOCM noticeably slowed the tubular flow rate and increased the mean shear-stress levels. We identified significant cytotoxic effects from the increased viscosity of IOCM within a three-dimensionally perfused channel, which was not apparent under low-shear-stress conditions. LOCM was cytotoxic, even under static or low-shear-stress conditions, and the cytotoxicity was possibly mediated by Erk1/2 inactivation. However, nephrotoxicity was comparable between LOCM and IOCM under high-shear-stress conditions. To date, researchers have suggested that the high viscosity of CM is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of CIN. In particular, IOCM has physiological osmolality at the cost of increased viscosity, and thus, its high viscosity could have detrimental effects on the kidney. However, the rheological aspects of CM have not been fully addressed in the pathophysiology of CIN. A previous in vitro study revealed that LOCM is more cytotoxic than IOCM under static conditions, which is inconsistent with clinical data [11]. The implementation of the microenvironment in a single nephron was not feasible using conventional in vitro experiments. The physicochemical properties of CM have been evaluated using indirect methods, such as dialysis [26]. We constructed the CIN-on-a-chip using the OrganoPlate platform, which contains an extracellular matrix and forms a 3D perfused tubular structure, mimicking an in vivo environment [18]. Functional studies of transporters, biomarkers, and gene expression using the OrganoPlate have already been tested and validated [27]. Given that renal tubular epithelial cells are continuously exposed to the fluid shear-stress of urine filtrate [28], kidney-on-a-chip may be an indispensable tool for the rheological study of renal diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on CIN using an organ-on-a-chip platform. Overall, our findings showed nephrotoxic effects of CM under shear-stress conditions which were distinct from those under static conditions. Under static conditions, higher cytotoxicity was observed even at low concentrations of CM compared to that of the control, which is not seen under in vivo conditions and in clinical settings. Since CIN mainly occurs when high-dose CM are used in patients with risk factors [29], our results under shear-stress conditions are more similar to the clinical situations. These findings may indicate the beneficial effects of fluid shear-stress within physiological levels. Shear stress is reported to activate Nrf2 expression in the renal proximal tubules, resulting in a protective role in CIN [30,31]. However, our findings also highlight the critical role of the high viscosity of IOCM in CIN. Increased viscosity of CM could contribute to tubular cell damage through flow-derived stresses such as tubular stretching, increased shear stress, and transmural pressure [32]. Similarly, renal tubular injury in urinary tract obstruction models is also mediated mainly through cellular stretching and altered shear-stress [33]. Fluid shear-stress beyond physiological levels could cause renal epithelial damage. Although the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, there has been some evidence related to the harmful effects of increased shear-stress on the cells. Studies on microfluidic platforms suggest that excessive shear-stress has detrimental effects on cells by detaching or disrupting the cytoskeleton [29,30]. Exposure of HK2 cells to high shear-stress (5 dyne/cm2) for 48 h caused structural derangement, including the loss of tight junctions, adherent junctions, and primary cilia [17]. Therefore, most microfluidic studies with renal tubular epithelial cells have used a physiological shear-stress of 0.2–1 dyn/cm2. As observed in our findings, viscosity-induced cytotoxicity was pronounced at a mean shear-stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. Additionally, a study by Garvin et al. suggested the vital role of tubular cell stretching in producing reactive oxygen species [34], which is a key pathogenesis in CIN. With a typical dose of CM, the plasma concentration is less than 20 mgI/mL [35]. However, CM are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules, and their intraluminal concentration increase along the renal tubules, with a peak concentration up to 100 times higher than that in plasma [36]. IOCM are approximately two times more concentrated due to their lower osmolality, which further exponentially increases urine viscosity (Figure 6A) [26]. In our mathematical simulation, the time constant of exponential decay for the fluid flow-rate is proportional to the fluid viscosity; therefore, it is much greater with IOCM. As a result, IOCM is excreted more slowly than LOCM, exerting high levels of shear stress on the tubular cells for a longer duration (Figure 6B,C). We showed that when assuming that the iodixanol and iopromide concentrations at the corticomedullary junction are 300 mgI/mL and 150 mgI/mL, respectively, the peak flow rate of iodixanol was six times slower than that of iopromide, and the time during which the shear stress level is above 1 dyn/cm2 was also seven times longer with iodixanol than with iopromide. These findings are in line with the results of some in vivo studies that related highly viscous CM to increased tubular pressure, prolonged CM retention, and subsequent decreased GFR and hypoxia [10]. A micropuncture study in rats by Ueda et al. showed that the viscosity of IOCM (iotrolan) was significantly higher than that of other LOCMs with slower urinary excretion [37]. Iotrolan also induced high intratubular hydrostatic pressure for a longer duration than LOCMs [38]. The high viscosity of iodixanol induces prolonged reduction in medullary oxygenation [39], which is a key feature of CIN. Nevertheless, these animal studies require sophisticated techniques and lack reproducibility; thus, similar findings have only been identified in a few studies. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Overview of the proposed models of contrast-induced nephropathy. (A) Iso-osmolar contrast media are twice as concentrated as low-osmolar contrast media and have a much greater viscosity. Data from Jost et al. [26]. The concentration and viscosity of CM are obtained from an in vitro dialysis model using polyethylene glycol solution with different osmolalities (290, 500, and 1000 mOsm/kg, which represents the mean osmolality of the renal cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla, respectively). (B) Overall mechanisms of contrast-induced nephropathy. (C) Comparison of iso-osmolar and low-osmolar contrast media in our model. CM—contrast media; LOCM—low-osmolar contrast media; IOCM—iso-osmolar contrast media; GFR—glomerular filtration rate.Urine viscosity can vary significantly with urine volume, which is closely associated with an individual’s hydration status. The effect of dehydration on renal concentration is more pronounced when using IOCM [10]. We assumed that CM was moderately to highly concentrated in the renal tubules. In addition, given that patients with CKD are at a greater risk of CIN, different shear-stress conditions were investigated to reflect the effect of nephron loss and increased SNGFR. Our findings indirectly showed that highly concentrated CM and nephron loss could contribute to increased shear-stress and renal toxicity, which is consistent with the results of a uninephrectomy mouse model [17]. We treated RPTEC with CM for 24 h, which also reflected the CKD condition. Patients with CKD usually show a longer retention of CM. Cortical retention of CM was observed in patients with CKD 24 h after CM administration, which was more pronounced in patients later diagnosed with CIN [40]. Conventionally, the high osmolality of CM is considered a major determinant of CIN. However, the role of osmolality in CIN pathogenesis has not been clearly determined. Rather, LOCM can confer beneficial effects on tubular cells by inducing osmotic diuresis and subsequently lowering urine viscosity. Indeed, LOCM causes a two-fold higher urine output than IOCM due to osmotic diuresis [41]. In this regard, the higher osmolality of LOCM relative to IOCM may serve as a protective factor against viscosity-induced renal toxicity. Additionally, we evaluated some pathway molecules that have been reported to be linked to CIN. Akt and Erk1/2 are among the molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation [25]. A previous in vitro study of CIN showed that both IOCM and LOCM induced dephosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 [25]. In particular, IOCM caused a greater decrease in p-Erk 1/2 in HK2 cells. However, we revealed that decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was only observed in the LOCM group under shear-stress conditions, and there was no difference in p-Akt levels between groups. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the exact mechanistic pathways of CIN, our findings possibly suggest that osmolar stress is associated with dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 or viscosity-related stress induces the activation of Erk1/2. Mechanical stretching of renal proximal tubular cells activates Erk1/2 signaling [42], and high-osmolar CM diatrizoate causes greater dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 compared to iopromide [43]. Collectively, viscosity-mediated nephrotoxicity was prominent under high shear-stress conditions. We found no difference between IOCM and LOCM under high fluid-shear-stress, which was similar to the clinical data. These findings suggest that the risk of CIN does not differ between IOCM and LOCM in patients with CKD. Even in a study showing a better effect of IOCM on renal toxicity, superiority of IOCM was not significant in the subgroup with lower GFR (<45 or 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [44]. In this context, the kidney-on-a-chip microfluidic platform could be a potential alternative in vitro model, which can provide easier control of various physical parameters. Our study has some limitations. This study highlights the critical role of the rheological effects of CM in terms of tubulodynamics. However, detailed mechanisms that mediate viscosity-induced tubular injury still remain elusive. More sophisticated methodology is warranted to determine the main contributing factors to viscosity-related injury. High viscosity also affects the hemodynamics in peritubular vessels. Therefore, extended microfluidic models combining vascular compartments with tubular counterparts would be useful. In addition, the limitations of the assumptions of the experimental design should be considered. We mathematically regarded the renal tubule as a rigid channel; however, it was highly elastic and deformable. In addition, the bidirectional pulsatile flow used in our model was not the same as the unilateral fluid flow in the renal tubules.5. Conclusions We demonstrated the application of a three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip model to evaluate the physicochemical factors of CM in CIN. Overall, our CIN model under shear-stress conditions reliably reflected in vivo situations. Our results highlight the role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high-shear-stress conditions and are quite different from the findings of conventional in vitro studies. LOCM showed higher cytotoxicity than IOCM in a dose-dependent manner under physiological shear-stress conditions. However, under high-shear-stress conditions, IOCM caused renal tubular cell damage comparable to that caused by LOCM, decreasing the urine flow rate and exposing cells to high shear-stress for a longer duration.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/mi13050688/s1, Figure S1: Mathematical simulation of bidirectional flows in iopromide groups; Figure S2: Mathematical simulation of bidirectional flows in iodixanol groups.
