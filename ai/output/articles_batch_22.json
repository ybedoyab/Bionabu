    "introduction": "Introduction The researches and clinical application of otoendoscope in otologic surgery are increasing, which not only expands otologists’ understanding of otologic anatomy and pathophysiology but also provides a new way for the treatment of otologic diseases.1,2 Otoendoscopic surgery is now considered as a safe and feasible surgical method. Natasha Pollak et al found that it could not only enhance the visibility of surgery but also reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis of some ear diseases due to its minimally invasion.1,3 However, the surgical field under otoendoscope is relatively narrow, and the light is easily absorbed by dark tissues or objects such as blood, which affects the brightness of the surgical field. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to operate in the narrow ear canal with 1 hand. Therefore, a clearer surgical field and better hemostatic effect are beneficial for the otoendoscopic surgery. Currently, the vasoconstrictor epinephrine is often used as a hemostatic drug in endoscopic surgery of otorhinolaryngology.4,5 Some of the most common methods include local injection and submucosal infiltration administration, both of which are effective in reducing the risk of intraoperative bleeding and improving field clarity.6,7 But the concentration of epinephrine used by different surgeons varies. Regardless of the administration method or concentration, as epinephrine is absorbed through the mucosa, the patients’ hemodynamics will have changes accordingly.8-11 In studies related to otoendoscopic surgery, Ali Moshaver et al found that the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increased 1 to 2 minutes after nasal mucosal injection of 1:200,000 epinephrine and returned to baseline after 5 minutes. 12 Bi Zhang et al found insufficient evidence to support the use of low concentration of epinephrine in the nasal submucosa to improve surgical clarity and hemostatic effect. 13 In the researches of otoendoscopic surgery, Marna List et al found that the hemostasis effect of topical application of 1:1000 epinephrine was equivalent to that of 1:10,000 epinephrine, and the safety factor was also similar in 2 groups. 14 Given the limited research on the use of epinephrine in otoendoscopic surgery, there are also issues such as fewer enrolled patients. We designed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) study to evaluate the effect of 4 different concentrations of epinephrine on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics in otoendoscopic surgery. Our goal was to select an appropriate concentration of epinephrine, while ensuring the safety of patients’ hemodynamic changes, and a clear surgical field can be obtained.",
    "methods": "Patients and Methods Study Design This was a double-blind, RCT study about the effect of subcutaneous injection of different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into external auditory canal (EAC) under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics. The patients who strictly met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to be injected with different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC subcutaneously under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery. The operations were all conducted by the same senior surgeon. The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and the present study was prespecified in the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. See the trial protocol in supplemental content. Patient Selection Assuming a power of 0.85 and a significance value of 0.05, considering a 20% dropout rate, each sample would need 39 patients, and the total sample size would be 156 cases. This double-blind, RCT study finally included 168 patients undergoing otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia from June 25, 2018, to January 17, 2022, at a single institution. Inclusion criteria included the following: The age range was from 18 to 65 years old. Patients who required otoendoscopic surgery and those who underwent bilateral surgery at the same time were only counted on one side. Otoendoscopic surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the preoperative anesthesia evaluation was classified as I or II by American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Exclusion criteria included the following: history of EAC injury (including ear surgery); history of refractory hypertension, obvious cardiovascular, liver, and kidney dysfunction or abnormal coagulation function; and disagree to sign informed consent form. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committees of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (2018-119-T97), and was registered in Clinical Trial Registry-China (ChiCTRI1800016647). All participants have provided written informed consent. Randomization Randomization was conducted by Statistician A from the clinical research center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Randomized seeds were generated by the SAS software, and envelope method was used for allocation and concealment. Randomization numbers were distributed to determine the patient’s treatment group (with serial numbers outside of the envelope and grouping information for group A/B/C/D). Double-Blind Protocol This study was a double-blind, RCT study. The specific process was as follows: The doctor who was not involved in this clinical trial served as the blinding administrator. Blind codes (indicating the epinephrine/physiological saline concentration groups as group A/B/C/D) were placed in envelopes and sealed separately. The envelopes needed to be sealed, signed, and dated by the blind administrator and the lead researcher. The envelopes were photographed and stored in the researcher’s medical record. The blind codes were kept by the blinding administrator. Patients were enrolled according to the random numbers. The anesthesia nurse prepared epinephrine/physiological saline solution and handed it over to the circulating nurse, who then handed over a certain concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline injection to the surgeon. The final data were analyzed by Statistician B, and a statistical report was issued on the differences of the effect among 4 concentration groups. After the envelopes were verified of being unopened by the blinding administrator and the lead researcher, the administrator unblinded handed them over to the lead researcher to make a final research report. General Anesthesia Method A standardized technique for general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation was employed for this study. Premedication was limited to dorasetron and pentylenethyclidine hydrochloride injection. Induction was with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 μg/kg), propofol (4 mg/kg), and rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg). An arterial line was placed by anesthesiology immediately after intubation. The maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with propofol (4 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.1 μg/kg/min), and sevoflurane (1.5 vol%). Data Collection Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded by invasive blood pressure monitoring. If a patient’s SBP is found to be ≥180 mmHg during the surgery, the anesthesiologist would immediately intervene and record the subsequent blood pressure values as pre-intervention ones. HR and ST segment were tracked by electrocardiogram monitor of Dräger’s Zeus Infinity Empowered anesthesia work platform. The following 3 leads were selected to monitor ST changes: Lead II was a limb lead, while lead V recorded for right heart, and lead I was moved to position V5 to record for left heart. Take the position 0.08 seconds after J point as the measurement point for ST analysis. The above-mentioned hemodynamic parameters were collected at the following 8 points: before injection, 0.1 minutes, 1 minute, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after injection. The values before injection were used as the baseline values. Epinephrine Application Preparation method of epinephrine/physiological saline injection: 1:5000 group (group C) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 4 mL physiological saline; 1:10,000 group (group B) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 9 mL physiological saline; 1:20,000 group (group A) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 19 mL physiological saline; and 1:40,000 group (group D) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 39 mL physiological saline. Injection method: Inject 0.5 mL of epinephrine/physiological saline into the junction of bone and cartilage at the posterior wall of EAC under endoscope. Evaluation of Surgical Field Clarity Surgical field clarity grading scale is shown in eTable 1 in the Supplemental Material. The 2 professional otolaryngologists participating in the evaluation were unaware of the concentration groups of epinephrine/physiological saline. If the score were consistent, then the grade would be the final result. If inconsistent, to ensure the conservatism of the results, we took the high grade (poor hemostatic effect) as final results. Evaluation of Tympanic Membrane Flap Flipping Time The starting point of tympanic membrane flap flipping was when the surgeon made an arc-shaped incision at the EAC. Then, the posterior skin and eardrum were flipped, exposing the fibrous bone ring and lifting it from the tympanic groove to identify the mucosa of the tympanic cavity. It was the end time of flap flipping when entering the tympanic cavity after incising the mucosa. The flap flipping time was recorded by the same anesthesia nurse in every surgery. Statistics SPSS for Windows, Version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Changes in hemodynamic parameters were compared with the baseline values for each patient using paired t test in each of the 4 groups. Differences in surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time in 4 concentration groups were compared using the chi-squared test. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.",

For the primary outcome of the surgical field clarity, there was no significant difference between the surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time among 4 concentration groups. On average, the surgical field clarity grade was 2.43 (±0.61) and the tympanic membrane flap flipping time was 371.99 (±230.43) seconds. The comparison results and diagrams among the 4 groups are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Outcome Comparisons in the 4 Treatment Groups.

Increases in HR, MAP, SBP, and DBP values were all observed in the 4 groups after injection (P < .05). Compared with each baseline value, the 1:5000 group brought more significant hemodynamic changes at the most of points of time. After 30 minutes of injection, almost all values of HR, MAP, SBP, and DBP in the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000) were able to return to baseline levels, while the higher ones (1:5000 and 1:10,000) remained elevated (Table 2, Figure 2). For ST values, although there were occasional statistical differences between the baseline and values after injection, considering that the dynamic changes belonged to the normal range of elevation or depression, it was believed that epinephrine injection may have little effect on them (eTable 4 in the Supplemental Material). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Diagram of hemodynamic changes after injection of epinephrine. (a) HR changes after epinephine injection of four groups. (b) MAP changes after epinephine injection of four groups. (c) SBP changes after epinephine injection of four groups. All patients’ SBPs were tracked after epinephrine injection. Once the value exceeds 180 mmHg, the anesthesiologist would immediately provide antihypertensive intervention. Out of 168 patients, 19 patients underwent antihypertensive treatment (eTable 5 in the Supplemental Material). Among them, 11 of these patients were from the 1:5000 group, 6 were from the 1:10,000 group, and 2 were from the 1:20,000 group. The results showed a statistical difference between the number of patients who needed antihypertensive intervention and the concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline (P = .040). By comparing the basic information data of the 19 epinephrine sensitive patients and the other 149 patients, including parameters of age, gender, hypertension or cardiovascular history, and antihypertensive medications, we did not find any characteristics that may be related to epinephrine sensitivity (Table 3).

    "discussion": "Discussion The data we have collected on the evaluation of surgical field clarity and hemodynamics can be interpreted in terms of patients’ effectiveness and safety of epinephrine injection for the otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Currently, topical vasoconstrictors used in endoscopic surgery include cocaine, oxymetazoline, and epinephrine. The use of cocaine has been greatly reduced in clinical practice due to its significant impact on hemodynamic effect and strong addiction.15,16 Although oxymetazoline has a good safety profile, its vasoconstrictor effect is not as good as that of other drugs and is now often used in pediatric surgery.4,16,17 Epinephrine is an α-and-β adrenoceptor agonist that can effectively constrict blood vessels and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators, which is commonly used in many endoscopic surgeries.4,5 Otologic surgeons often use local injection of epinephrine during otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, but the concentrations injected into the EAC vary among different surgeons, ranging from 1:1000 to 1:60,000. 18 Brackmann et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:40,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine, and using 1:60,000 solution when over 65 years old. 19 Mario Sanna et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:10,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine to achieve hemostatic effects. 20 Marna A. List’s research suggests that local injection of epinephrine at concentrations of 1:1000 and 1:10,000 during tympanoplasty can produce equivalent hemostatic effect and ensure safety. 14 However, there is currently no clear guidelines on how to choose the concentration of epinephrine. We believe that an appropriate concentration can maintain patients’ hemodynamic changes within normal ranges, at the same time making the surgical field clear under otoendoscope. In this study, based on a large number of relevant research and data, we selected 4 epinephrine/physiological saline concentration groups (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, and 1:40,000) to undergo subcutaneous local injection during otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Evaluate the impact of different concentrations on surgical field clarity through 2 parameters: surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. The results showed that it was not related to the concentration level, and there was no statistical difference among the 4 groups in terms of surgical field clarity grade (P = .577) or tympanic membrane flap flipping time (P = .490). Since the impact on the surgical field clarity is equivalent, the magnitude of its impact on patients’ hemodynamics can serve as a reference for selecting the optimal concentration. Our study showed that at 1 minute after injection, the HR- and BP-related parameters (HR, MAP, SBP, DBP) of the 4 groups almost all increased compared with the baseline value, especially in the 1:5000 group, whose related data had very significant statistical differences. In the group with relatively-high epinephrine/physiological concentrations (1:5000 and 1:10,000), this hemodynamic change continued until 30 minutes after injection, while in the group with relatively-low concentrations (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the data at 30 minutes after injection showed that the patients’ HR and BP returned to baseline values. It is worth noting that, except for the patients in the 1:5000 concentration group, the curve of HR- and BP-related indicators of the patient presented a double-wave peak shape, showing an upward trend immediately after epinephrine injection, falling back 5 minutes after injection, then rising again, and then slowly falling back to baseline. We believe that the appearance of the first peak originated from α, β adrenergic receptor activation of epinephrine. With the metabolism of the drug, the curve entered its first trough, which triggered a protective mechanism in the body that caused HR and BP to rise again, and gradually returned to baseline as the drug further metabolized. In addition, our data showed that although epinephrine injection occasionally caused significant changes in patients’ ST, its impact on ST was not considered as its dynamic changes were all within the normal range. So, there is not enough evidence in this study to suggest that epinephrine injection may lead to myocardial ischemia. Taking into account the impact of 4 concentration groups on patient’s surgical field clarity and hemodynamics, in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions when the benefits obtained are similar, we believe that it is more recommended to choose a concentration that has a smaller impact on patients’ hemodynamic parameters, that is, a concentration of epinephrine adenosine/physiological saline between 1:20,000 and 1:40,000. Limitations We recognize the greatest limitation to our study is that control group (physiological saline) could be set up to compare with the treatment groups on the outcomes.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Four concentration groups of topical epinephrine injection under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery has the same effect on surgical field clarity. For the stability of patients’ hemodynamics, we would prefer to recommend the use of concentrations with minimal impact on hemodynamics, ranging from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000.",

Minimize the impact on hemodynamics. Introduction The researches and clinical application of otoendoscope in otologic surgery are increasing, which not only expands otologists’ understanding of otologic anatomy and pathophysiology but also provides a new way for the treatment of otologic diseases.1,2 Otoendoscopic surgery is now considered as a safe and feasible surgical method. Natasha Pollak et al found that it could not only enhance the visibility of surgery but also reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis of some ear diseases due to its minimally invasion.1,3 However, the surgical field under otoendoscope is relatively narrow, and the light is easily absorbed by dark tissues or objects such as blood, which affects the brightness of the surgical field. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to operate in the narrow ear canal with 1 hand. Therefore, a clearer surgical field and better hemostatic effect are beneficial for the otoendoscopic surgery. Currently, the vasoconstrictor epinephrine is often used as a hemostatic drug in endoscopic surgery of otorhinolaryngology.4,5 Some of the most common methods include local injection and submucosal infiltration administration, both of which are effective in reducing the risk of intraoperative bleeding and improving field clarity.6,7 But the concentration of epinephrine used by different surgeons varies. Regardless of the administration method or concentration, as epinephrine is absorbed through the mucosa, the patients’ hemodynamics will have changes accordingly.8-11 In studies related to otoendoscopic surgery, Ali Moshaver et al found that the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increased 1 to 2 minutes after nasal mucosal injection of 1:200,000 epinephrine and returned to baseline after 5 minutes. 12 Bi Zhang et al found insufficient evidence to support the use of low concentration of epinephrine in the nasal submucosa to improve surgical clarity and hemostatic effect. 13 In the researches of otoendoscopic surgery, Marna List et al found that the hemostasis effect of topical application of 1:1000 epinephrine was equivalent to that of 1:10,000 epinephrine, and the safety factor was also similar in 2 groups. 14 Given the limited research on the use of epinephrine in otoendoscopic surgery, there are also issues such as fewer enrolled patients. We designed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) study to evaluate the effect of 4 different concentrations of epinephrine on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics in otoendoscopic surgery. Our goal was to select an appropriate concentration of epinephrine, while ensuring the safety of patients’ hemodynamic changes, and a clear surgical field can be obtained.Patients and Methods Study Design This was a double-blind, RCT study about the effect of subcutaneous injection of different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into external auditory canal (EAC) under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics. The patients who strictly met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to be injected with different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC subcutaneously under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery. The operations were all conducted by the same senior surgeon. The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and the present study was prespecified in the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. See the trial protocol in supplemental content.Patient Selection Assuming a power of 0.85 and a significance value of 0.05, considering a 20% dropout rate, each sample would need 39 patients, and the total sample size would be 156 cases. This double-blind, RCT study finally included 168 patients undergoing otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia from June 25, 2018, to January 17, 2022, at a single institution. Inclusion criteria included the following: The age range was from 18 to 65 years old. Patients who required otoendoscopic surgery and those who underwent bilateral surgery at the same time were only counted on one side. Otoendoscopic surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the preoperative anesthesia evaluation was classified as I or II by American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Exclusion criteria included the following: history of EAC injury (including ear surgery); history of refractory hypertension, obvious cardiovascular, liver, and kidney dysfunction or abnormal coagulation function; and disagree to sign informed consent form. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committees of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (2018-119-T97), and was registered in Clinical Trial Registry-China (ChiCTRI1800016647). All participants have provided written informed consent.Randomization Randomization was conducted by Statistician A from the clinical research center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Randomized seeds were generated by the SAS software, and envelope method was used for allocation and concealment. Randomization numbers were distributed to determine the patient’s treatment group (with serial numbers outside of the envelope and grouping information for group A/B/C/D).Double-Blind Protocol This study was a double-blind, RCT study. The specific process was as follows: The doctor who was not involved in this clinical trial served as the blinding administrator. Blind codes (indicating the epinephrine/physiological saline concentration groups as group A/B/C/D) were placed in envelopes and sealed separately. The envelopes needed to be sealed, signed, and dated by the blind administrator and the lead researcher. The envelopes were photographed and stored in the researcher’s medical record. The blind codes were kept by the blinding administrator. Patients were enrolled according to the random numbers. The anesthesia nurse prepared epinephrine/physiological saline solution and handed it over to the circulating nurse, who then handed over a certain concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline injection to the surgeon. The final data were analyzed by Statistician B, and a statistical report was issued on the differences of the effect among 4 concentration groups. After the envelopes were verified of being unopened by the blinding administrator and the lead researcher, the administrator unblinded handed them over to the lead researcher to make a final research report. General Anesthesia Method A standardized technique for general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation was employed for this study. Premedication was limited to dorasetron and pentylenethyclidine hydrochloride injection. Induction was with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 μg/kg), propofol (4 mg/kg), and rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg). An arterial line was placed by anesthesiology immediately after intubation. The maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with propofol (4 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.1 μg/kg/min), and sevoflurane (1.5 vol%).Data Collection Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded by invasive blood pressure monitoring. If a patient’s SBP is found to be ≥180 mmHg during the surgery, the anesthesiologist would immediately intervene and record the subsequent blood pressure values as pre-intervention ones. HR and ST segment were tracked by electrocardiogram monitor of Dräger’s Zeus Infinity Empowered anesthesia work platform. The following 3 leads were selected to monitor ST changes: Lead II was a limb lead, while lead V recorded for right heart, and lead I was moved to position V5 to record for left heart. Take the position 0.08 seconds after J point as the measurement point for ST analysis. The above-mentioned hemodynamic parameters were collected at the following 8 points: before injection, 0.1 minutes, 1 minute, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after injection. The values before injection were used as the baseline values.Epinephrine Application Preparation method of epinephrine/physiological saline injection: 1:5000 group (group C) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 4 mL physiological saline; 1:10,000 group (group B) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 9 mL physiological saline; 1:20,000 group (group A) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 19 mL physiological saline; and 1:40,000 group (group D) (n = 42): 1 mL 0.1% epinephrine and 39 mL physiological saline. Injection method: Inject 0.5 mL of epinephrine/physiological saline into the junction of bone and cartilage at the posterior wall of EAC under endoscope.Evaluation of Surgical Field Clarity Surgical field clarity grading scale is shown in eTable 1 in the Supplemental Material. The 2 professional otolaryngologists participating in the evaluation were unaware of the concentration groups of epinephrine/physiological saline. If the score were consistent, then the grade would be the final result. If inconsistent, to ensure the conservatism of the results, we took the high grade (poor hemostatic effect) as final results.Evaluation of Tympanic Membrane Flap Flipping Time The starting point of tympanic membrane flap flipping was when the surgeon made an arc-shaped incision at the EAC. Then, the posterior skin and eardrum were flipped, exposing the fibrous bone ring and lifting it from the tympanic groove to identify the mucosa of the tympanic cavity. It was the end time of flap flipping when entering the tympanic cavity after incising the mucosa. The flap flipping time was recorded by the same anesthesia nurse in every surgery.Statistics SPSS for Windows, Version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Changes in hemodynamic parameters were compared with the baseline values for each patient using paired t test in each of the 4 groups. Differences in surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time in 4 concentration groups were compared using the chi-squared test. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.Results A total of 168 patients who met inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study (Figure 1). Basic demographic details of all patients are presented in eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplemental Material. There was no statistically-significant difference in all basic information data between the 4 testing groups. The average age was 42.8 (range, 18-65) years old, with a female preponderance. Identified risk factors for hemodynamic changes included hypertension and sinus arrhythmia. Figure 1.

For the primary outcome of the surgical field clarity, there was no significant difference between the surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time among 4 concentration groups. On average, the surgical field clarity grade was 2.43 (±0.61) and the tympanic membrane flap flipping time was 371.99 (±230.43) seconds. The comparison results and diagrams among the 4 groups are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Outcome Comparisons in the 4 Treatment Groups.

Increases in HR, MAP, SBP, and DBP values were all observed in the 4 groups after injection (P < .05). Compared with each baseline value, the 1:5000 group brought more significant hemodynamic changes at the most of points of time. After 30 minutes of injection, almost all values of HR, MAP, SBP, and DBP in the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000) were able to return to baseline levels, while the higher ones (1:5000 and 1:10,000) remained elevated (Table 2, Figure 2). For ST values, although there were occasional statistical differences between the baseline and values after injection, considering that the dynamic changes belonged to the normal range of elevation or depression, it was believed that epinephrine injection may have little effect on them (eTable 4 in the Supplemental Material). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Diagram of hemodynamic changes after injection of epinephrine. (a) HR changes after epinephine injection of four groups. (b) MAP changes after epinephine injection of four groups. (c) SBP changes after epinephine injection of four groups.All patients’ SBPs were tracked after epinephrine injection. Once the value exceeds 180 mmHg, the anesthesiologist would immediately provide antihypertensive intervention. Out of 168 patients, 19 patients underwent antihypertensive treatment (eTable 5 in the Supplemental Material). Among them, 11 of these patients were from the 1:5000 group, 6 were from the 1:10,000 group, and 2 were from the 1:20,000 group. The results showed a statistical difference between the number of patients who needed antihypertensive intervention and the concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline (P = .040). By comparing the basic information data of the 19 epinephrine sensitive patients and the other 149 patients, including parameters of age, gender, hypertension or cardiovascular history, and antihypertensive medications, we did not find any characteristics that may be related to epinephrine sensitivity (Table 3).

Currently, topical vasoconstrictors used in endoscopic surgery include cocaine, oxymetazoline, and epinephrine. The use of cocaine has been greatly reduced in clinical practice due to its significant impact on hemodynamic effect and strong addiction.15,16 Although oxymetazoline has a good safety profile, its vasoconstrictor effect is not as good as that of other drugs and is now often used in pediatric surgery.4,16,17 Epinephrine is an α-and-β adrenoceptor agonist that can effectively constrict blood vessels and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators, which is commonly used in many endoscopic surgeries.4,5 Otologic surgeons often use local injection of epinephrine during otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, but the concentrations injected into the EAC vary among different surgeons, ranging from 1:1000 to 1:60,000. 18 Brackmann et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:40,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine, and using 1:60,000 solution when over 65 years old. 19 Mario Sanna et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:10,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine to achieve hemostatic effects. 20 Marna A. List’s research suggests that local injection of epinephrine at concentrations of 1:1000 and 1:10,000 during tympanoplasty can produce equivalent hemostatic effect and ensure safety. 14 However, there is currently no clear guidelines on how to choose the concentration of epinephrine. We believe that an appropriate concentration can maintain patients’ hemodynamic changes within normal ranges, at the same time making the surgical field clear under otoendoscope. In this study, based on a large number of relevant research and data, we selected 4 epinephrine/physiological saline concentration groups (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, and 1:40,000) to undergo subcutaneous local injection during otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Evaluate the impact of different concentrations on surgical field clarity through 2 parameters: surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. The results showed that it was not related to the concentration level, and there was no statistical difference among the 4 groups in terms of surgical field clarity grade (P = .577) or tympanic membrane flap flipping time (P = .490). Since the impact on the surgical field clarity is equivalent, the magnitude of its impact on patients’ hemodynamics can serve as a reference for selecting the optimal concentration. Our study showed that at 1 minute after injection, the HR- and BP-related parameters (HR, MAP, SBP, DBP) of the 4 groups almost all increased compared with the baseline value, especially in the 1:5000 group, whose related data had very significant statistical differences. In the group with relatively-high epinephrine/physiological concentrations (1:5000 and 1:10,000), this hemodynamic change continued until 30 minutes after injection, while in the group with relatively-low concentrations (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the data at 30 minutes after injection showed that the patients’ HR and BP returned to baseline values. It is worth noting that, except for the patients in the 1:5000 concentration group, the curve of HR- and BP-related indicators of the patient presented a double-wave peak shape, showing an upward trend immediately after epinephrine injection, falling back 5 minutes after injection, then rising again, and then slowly falling back to baseline. We believe that the appearance of the first peak originated from α, β adrenergic receptor activation of epinephrine. With the metabolism of the drug, the curve entered its first trough, which triggered a protective mechanism in the body that caused HR and BP to rise again, and gradually returned to baseline as the drug further metabolized. In addition, our data showed that although epinephrine injection occasionally caused significant changes in patients’ ST, its impact on ST was not considered as its dynamic changes were all within the normal range. So, there is not enough evidence in this study to suggest that epinephrine injection may lead to myocardial ischemia. Taking into account the impact of 4 concentration groups on patient’s surgical field clarity and hemodynamics, in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions when the benefits obtained are similar, we believe that it is more recommended to choose a concentration that has a smaller impact on patients’ hemodynamic parameters, that is, a concentration of epinephrine adenosine/physiological saline between 1:20,000 and 1:40,000. Limitations We recognize the greatest limitation to our study is that control group (physiological saline) could be set up to compare with the treatment groups on the outcomes.Conclusion Four concentration groups of topical epinephrine injection under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery has the same effect on surgical field clarity. For the stability of patients’ hemodynamics, we would prefer to recommend the use of concentrations with minimal impact on hemodynamics, ranging from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000.Supplemental Material sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241288811 – Supplemental material for The Effect of Different Concentrations of Epinephrine in Otoendoscopic Surgery on Surgical Field Clarity: A Double-Blind, Randomized Study sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241288811.docx (27.6KB, docx) Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241288811 for The Effect of Different Concentrations of Epinephrine in Otoendoscopic Surgery on Surgical Field Clarity: A Double-Blind, Randomized Study by Wenying Shu, Tingting Jin, Jinya Shi, Jingjie Li and Zhaoyan Wang in Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck SurgeryFootnotes Author Contributions: W.S.: Data analysis and writing.

Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population.PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS).STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study.SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample.OUTCOME MEASURES: For multifidus and erector spinae at L3–L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1–S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up.METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses.RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation).CONCLUSIONS: We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

    "introduction": "Introduction On Earth, the lumbar spine bears the load of the upper body in upright posture and is stabilized by both passive and active systems [1]. Passive postural stability is provided by the osteoligamentous lumbar spine, which includes the intervertebral discs, vertebrae, synovial facet joint cartilage, and ligaments. This passive system serves to constrain motion via a mixture of complex tissue material properties and geometries. By contrast, active postural stability is provided by muscle tendon complexes that generate force, both locally at the vertebral segments and globally [2,3]. Some muscles act primarily to induce gross trunk movements, whereas others act as stabilizers to support posture and prevent excessive or unwanted motions [4]. Harmony between the passive and active stability systems is coordinated by neural control mechanisms ([1]). Diurnal loading patterns of activity and rest are critical for maintained spine health and function. For instance, as a poro-viscoelastic material, the disc undergoes significant dehydration, height loss, and concomitant decreased bending stiffness after sustained loading [5]. Decreased bending stiffness can lead to increased tissue strains that trigger paraspinal muscle hyperexcitability [6], thereby increasing active stiffness to compensate for deficient passive stiffness. Rest periods allow the disc to osmotically recover water, height, and bio-mechanical properties. Diurnal periods of activity and rest also facilitate transport of nutrients and metabolites to and from cells within the disc matrix and avascular nucleus pulposus. Microgravity exposure removes physiological diurnal loads from the lumbar spine, which can hypothetically disrupt lumbar stabilization by deconditioning both the passive, active, and neural stabilizing systems. Prolonged microgravity is known to cause global muscle atrophy [7] and bone loss [8,9]. It is not surprising therefore, that spaceflight puts astronauts at risk for low back pain and disc injury. In National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies, astronauts experience localized (non-radiating) low back pain during spaceflight (43% incidence [10]) and a 2.8-fold higher prevalence of lumbar disc herniation following spaceflight [11]. Yet, the detrimental mechanisms of microgravity on lumbar health are uncertain. Reports of increased post-flight stature suggest that microgravity causes “spinal lengthening” [12,13] perhaps due to accumulated swelling of unloaded discs [14]. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro microgravity simulations which demonstrate increased disc height and passive spinal bending stiffness [15], and in vivo bed rest studies on Earth [14]. It is tempting to conclude that such changes explain the increased risk of post-flight disc herniation, but space studies to date have not been able to demonstrate lumbar disc height changes following spaceflight of either 8 days [16] or 6 months [17] duration. Therefore, how microgravity adversely affects the human lumbar spine remains undetermined. To identify back pain and injury mechanisms, we conducted a longitudinal study of six NASA astronaut crewmembers in whom lumbar spine anatomy and biomechanics were quantified before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on the International Space Station (ISS). Results of this study are valuable not only to inform countermeasures to reduce disc herniation risk in astronauts, but also to provide insights into spine stability that are relevant to improving back health in the general population.",
    "methods": "Methods Subjects With institutional research board approval, spine imaging and health data were assessed from six NASA astronaut crewmembers at two time points: before launch (“pre”) and 1 day following 6 months’ spaceflight on the ISS (“post”). We followed up with each subject during a mandatory debrief at 1 year following their return to Earth where they self-reported the occurrence and duration of any low back symptoms or injuries within that year. Subjects included one female and five males (ages ranging from 46 to 55 years). No exclusion criteria were applied beyond NASA’s general health and fitness criteria for spaceflight. As such, our sample was uncontrolled for potential comorbidities such as age-related spine degeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging Lumbar spine imaging was performed with subjects lying supine in a 3T scanner with a 4-channel cervical-thoracic-lumbar coil (Siemens Syngo workstation; software Version B19, Siemens AG Healthcare Sector, Erlangen, Germany). Localizer images, sagittal and axial T2-weighted images (TR/TE, 3,010/92 ms; thickness, 4.0 mm; field of view, 220 cm; matrix, 320×320; NEX, 2; bandwidth per pixel, 252 Hz/Px; and fat saturation), and sagittal T1-weighted images (similar parameters as T2, except TR/TE was 2,100/9.4) were acquired. The additional T2 map multiecho sequence was then performed as a single midline sagittal image (TR/TE, 1,800/18 ms; inter-echo delay, 18 ms; echo-train length, 1; section thickness, 7.0 mm; field of view, 22 cm; matrix, 320×320; NEX, 1; and bandwidth per pixel, 260 Hz/Px). Fat saturation and anterior saturation bands were applied. The scanning time for the T2 map sequence was 5 minutes 30 seconds. We measured lumbar lordosis (sagittal angle between L1–S1 cranial end plates on the supine magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), individual disc and vertebral wedging angles in the sagittal plane [17], disc water content (inferred from T2-relaxation maps [18]), Pfirrmann grade (by co-author CWO), the presence or absence of vertebral end plate irregularities (by co-author CWO), cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA as a measure of fat infiltration of lumbar spine extensor muscles (multifidus and erector spinae) at L3–L4. CSA and FCSA data were averaged across four adjacent images at L3–L4. The L3–L4 level was used for our analysis because it was most reliably captured by manual segmentation: there was occasional, inadequate image quality at other lumbar levels. End plate irregularities were scored based on presence or absence of morphologic defects and underlying bone marrow signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images [19]. FCSA was measured by setting a threshold to isolate lean muscle area within the total CSA [20,21]. The interclass correlation for measurement reliability of lumbar lordosis, vertebral and disc wedging, disc water content, and muscle FCSA ranged from 0.89 to 0.99; p<.05. All MRI measurements were done using OsiriX DICOM viewer (Version 8.0, Pixmeo, Bernex, Switzerland) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) software. Dynamic fluoroscopy In separate active (standing) and passive (side lying) postures, we quantified intersegmental flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc. A 12-inch surgical C-arm Vertebral Motion Analysis system (VMA; Orthokinematics, Inc, Austin, TX, USA) captured fluoros-copy videos to measure intervertebral rotation that was measured with vertebral tracking algorithms (KineGraph VMA). Controlled bending platforms achieved passive and active postures, with each subject’s pelvis bolstered to isolate trunk motion. Each subject was guided through a specified range of 70° sagittal and coronal motion, performed at a rate of 5° per second. The measurement reliability of intervertebral rotation from this method has low variability compared with digitized manual techniques with ±1.53° for intra-rater measurements and ±2.15° for inter-rater measurements [22,23]. Data analysis All pre-flight variables were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical analyses included paired t tests to compare changes in pre- and post-flight variables among subjects, and simple regression analysis to test for relationships between pre- to post-flight changes for separate variables. Significance was defined as p<.05. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata (Version 13, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) software.",
    "results": "Results Lumbar lordosis Following spaceflight, lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) in all six subjects (average change: −11.1%, p=.009; Table). After comparing the sums of lumbar disc wedging (L1–L2 through L5–S1) and lumbar vertebral wedging (L1–L5), separately, we found that neither lumbar disc wedging nor vertebral wedging significantly changed following space-flight, implying that both changed variably in contribution to post-flight decreases in lumbar lordosis. In two of the six subjects, total lumbar vertebral wedging decreased by 8° and 9° (−13% and −23% of pre-flight lordosis, respectively), indicating that vertebral bodies lost height on the anterior border relative to the posterior border.

ROM data are available for only five of six crew and in a few cases is missing from L1 to L2 or L5 to S1 because it was outside the field of view. p-Values are from one-tailed paired t tests. Bolded text indicates statistical significance. Intersegmental range of motion Active (standing) FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004; Table). Passive (side lying) FE ROM did not demonstrate similar decreases for those middle three lumbar discs, but did show a surprising decrease in motion at the L5–S1 disc (−40.0%, p=.03; Table). Muscle atrophy Cross-sectional area, FCSA, and FCSA/CSA of the lumbar extensor muscles (multifidus and erector spinae) changed variably among subjects, with one subject showing an unexpected increase in CSA and FCSA following spaceflight. The remaining five subjects experienced a 20% average decrease in FCSA and 8%–9% average decrease in CSA for both multifidus and erector spinae following spaceflight, but there was not a significant decrease in CSA and FCSA for either muscle when accounting for all six subjects (Table). Changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in the observed lumbar lordosis seen with lying supine (r2=0.86, p=.008, Fig. 1) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007, Fig. 1). Changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA also correlated with lumbar lordosis (r2=0.69, p=.03). In comparison, changes in erector spinae did not relate to changes in supine lumbar lordosis (r2=0.35, p=.22), active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.21, p=.44), or FE ROM at any other level affected by spaceflight.

This result was true when testing each lumbar level separately and when testing the total lumbar disc water content for each subject (n=6 and p>.05 for all; Table). We also found no effect of microgravity on water content after pooling all the lumbar discs among six subjects (n=30; p=.51) and testing whether Pfirrmann grade had an effect on pre- to post-flight change in water content (p=.072, Fig. 2). Pfirrmann grade, which is in part defined by disc water content, did not change for any lumbar disc during spaceflight. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Change in water content is represented by the % change in T2 mean between pre- and post-flight. We found no systematic relationship between prolonged microgravity and disc water content, with or without adjusting for pre-flight Pfirrmann grade. End plate irregularities and post-flight symptoms We did not find any pre-existing spinal pathologies or Pfirrmann grade to change following spaceflight. Preexisting spinal pathology included only two subjects with end plate irregularities accompanied by positive bone marrow lesions indicative of Type 2 Modic changes (Fig. 3), a condition previously linked to discogenic pain [24]. At a 1-year post-flight follow-up meeting with each astronaut, we learned whether they experienced chronic low back pain or injury following spaceflight. The same two subjects with end plate irregularities were the only individuals to present post-flight symptoms, one reporting chronic low back pain and the other reporting both chronic low back pain and a disc herniation at L4–L5 (Fig. 3).

    "discussion": "Discussion This unique longitudinal study underscores the coupled role of passive and active spine stabilizers in maintaining lumbar spine health. We observed that 6 months of space-flight produced significant effects on lumbar biomechanics—the supine lordotic curvature flattened, and the intersegmental ROM decreased. These changes can be detrimental by increasing loads and stresses within the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies [25,26], particularly when re-introduced to gravity upon return to Earth. However, the mechanisms for these post-flight changes surprised us. Our results show that the effect of microgravity on active postural stabilizers (eg, muscle atrophy) may be responsible for post-flight increases in stature and risk of disc herniation, rather than the passive postural stabilizers (eg, disc swelling) as previously hypothesized. We observed that paraspinal muscle atrophy, specifically of the multifidus, was strongly associated with post-flight decreases in lumbar lordosis and intersegmental ROM. The multifidus attaches directly to the lumbar vertebra and acts locally to normally provide the greatest active stiffness in both the sagittal and frontal planes [27–29]. It also has an important role in proprioception and facilitating accurate spine positioning [30]. In this manner, the multifidus acts as a bowstring to accomplish fine adjustment and support of lumbar lordosis [31,32]. Multifidus atrophy in the general population has been linked to chronic low back pain, likely due to alterations in lumbar posture and kinematics [33]. For example, paraspinal muscle atrophy associates with a loss of lordosis [34,35] in patients with degenerative flat back syndrome [36]. The relevance of this mechanism to spaceflight has been previously suggested based on human volunteer studies of prolonged bed rest where multifidus atrophy correlated with loss of lumbar lordosis (approximately 1.5 degrees at L4–L5 [37]). A recent study reported trunk muscle cross-sectional area measured in a single astronaut following 6 months space-flight (not a subject of this current study) and showed that multifidus in the lower lumbar spine decreased more than other trunk muscles [38]. Our current study is the first to demonstrate the strong association between multifidus quality, lumbar lordosis, and intersegmental ROM in vivo. Microgravity-induced lumbar spine flattening has been hypothesized based on external postural changes (“spinal lengthening”) noted in-flight [12]. Our results indicate that lumbar flattening persists following return to Earth and is linked to multifidus atrophy rather than disc swelling. Lumbar lordosis is a morphologic and biomechanical adaptation particular to humans, enabling effective upright posture and efficient bipedal locomotion under gravitational load [16,39]. Lordosis decreases the maximum forces on spinal tissues by distributing load between the disc and facet joints [40–42]. Muscular support actively stabilizes lumbar lordosis while bearing compressive loads by directing axial load along the lordotic alignment [43]. Therefore, it is not surprising that prolonged removal of gravitational loading can adversely affect lumbar lordosis. Reduced lumbar lordosis driven by muscular atrophy may lead to spinal lengthening via postural changes, as well as increased herniation risk due to increased compressive disc loads and potential for exceeding ROM in flexion [25]. Although our work is limited because we do not have precise pre- and post-flight stature measurements, future work will investigate the effect of microgravity on lumbar lordosis in standing posture and overall sagittal balance. Our observation that microgravity primarily influences active spine stabilizers is further supported by comparing intersegmental ROM measured in the standing posture (when trunk muscles are active) versus side-lying posture (when trunk muscles are relaxed). Post-flight sagittal ROM of the middle three lumbar segments (L2–L3, L3–L4, L4–L5) was decreased during standing, but not when lying. These data, plus hydration information available from T2-mapping, indicate that disc swelling does not systematically affect post-flight lumbar spine stiffening, and presumably, post-flight disc herniation risk. Absence of systematic disc hydration increases in our subjects is counter to prior studies where it has long been hypothesized that post-flight changes in astronaut stature arise from supraphysiological disc swelling [12–14]. Our current results, along with recently published data from our team showing negligible changes in disc height [20], demonstrate that disc swelling does not drive changes in post-flight lumbar biomechanics. Prior work on mice demonstrate a degradation of disc biomechanical and biochemical properties following 2 weeks’ spaceflight [44–48], but only in the caudal (tail) segments, which may be deteriorating due to excessive use as a means for rodents to propel themselves around the in-flight cages. Furthermore, in prior work, we compared the biomechanical swelling properties of both lumbar and caudal murine discs and report that only the caudal segments showed degraded biomechanical properties following spaceflight [47]. On the other hand, bed rest studies do show increases in disc size following extended inactivity [49,50], an effect that can persist for up to 2 years [51]. An early study by LeBlanc et al. [50] directly compared the effect of 5 weeks of bed rest and 8 days of spaceflight on disc height. They found that bed rest had an effect, but short duration spaceflight did not. The fact that we did not observe systematic lumbar disc swelling from prolonged microgravity may be due to in-flight exercise protocols that axially load the spine. For instance, exercises using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) help maintain spine and hip bone mass [52]. Yet, although exercise protocols designed for ISS are effective for reducing the in-flight loss of general skeletal muscle mass [53], our data indicate they are not preserving core trunk stabilizers, specifically the multifidus. In addition, ground-based studies of ISS countermeasures on individuals following bed-rest induced atrophy show an insufficient effect on lumbopelvic musculoskeletal recovery [54]. This is not surprising because multifidus atrophy can exist in elite, highly conditioned athletes [55], and given the unique role of the multifidus as a stabilizer to stiffen the trunk rather than create motion, it requires specific training regimens directed toward proper activation [56–58]. Although our results show that spaceflight affects the multifidus for all subjects, we found that the risk for post-flight symptoms may relate to pre-existing spinal pathology. Two of the six astronauts presented post-flight symptoms (Fig. 3) and these two subjects also presented end plate irregularities with type 2 Modic changes in the adjacent vertebral bone marrow. End plate irregularities [24,59] and Modic changes [19] have been linked to chronic low back pain in the general population as they represent regions of structural weakening and pro-inflammatory communication between the disc and bone marrow [60]. Weakening at the disc-vertebra junction could be exacerbated by microgravity-induced changes in vertebral bone quality [48,61] and increased disc loading from lumbar flattening [25] that together heighten risk of failure and injury at the disc-bone interface when reintroducing a relatively less stable lumbar spine to gravitational load. Like many prior studies on subjects exposed to microgravity, this work is subject to limitations in sample size and lack of in-flight data. More work needs to be done to understand whether or not there is significant disc swelling during spaceflight. Although our work indicates that disc swelling is not significantly different following spaceflight, we acknowledge that a considerable amount of changes in disc water content could happen in the ~24-hour period between landing and post-flight imaging. Further work is being done using ultrasound to address disc height during spaceflight. Regardless, our results demonstrate that in spite of negligible changes in disc swelling, significant postural and stiffness changes occurred following spaceflight and related to changes in multifidus muscular stability. Future work involves collecting similar data on additional astronauts and aims to implement countermeasure exercises targeting the multifidus. If multifidus health is maintained during spaceflight, astronauts with pre-existing spinal pathology may be less vulnerable to post-flight symptoms and injury. This prospective study sheds light on mechanisms of post-flight back pain and disc injury—multifidus atrophy appears associated with spinal flattening and increased stiffness. We hypothesize that these factors, when combined, increase injury potential, particularly in those subjects with pre-existing evidence of vertebral end plate insufficiency. These results have implications also for deconditioned spines on Earth. We intend to use these results to develop countermeasures targeting the multifidus muscles and new research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury.",

Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population.PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS).STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study.SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample.OUTCOME MEASURES: For multifidus and erector spinae at L3–L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1–S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up.METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses.RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation).CONCLUSIONS: We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Passive postural stability is provided by the osteoligamentous lumbar spine, which includes the intervertebral discs, vertebrae, synovial facet joint cartilage, and ligaments. This passive system serves to constrain motion via a mixture of complex tissue material properties and geometries. By contrast, active postural stability is provided by muscle tendon complexes that generate force, both locally at the vertebral segments and globally [2,3]. Some muscles act primarily to induce gross trunk movements, whereas others act as stabilizers to support posture and prevent excessive or unwanted motions [4]. Harmony between the passive and active stability systems is coordinated by neural control mechanisms ([1]). Diurnal loading patterns of activity and rest are critical for maintained spine health and function. For instance, as a poro-viscoelastic material, the disc undergoes significant dehydration, height loss, and concomitant decreased bending stiffness after sustained loading [5]. Decreased bending stiffness can lead to increased tissue strains that trigger paraspinal muscle hyperexcitability [6], thereby increasing active stiffness to compensate for deficient passive stiffness. Rest periods allow the disc to osmotically recover water, height, and bio-mechanical properties. Diurnal periods of activity and rest also facilitate transport of nutrients and metabolites to and from cells within the disc matrix and avascular nucleus pulposus. Microgravity exposure removes physiological diurnal loads from the lumbar spine, which can hypothetically disrupt lumbar stabilization by deconditioning both the passive, active, and neural stabilizing systems. Prolonged microgravity is known to cause global muscle atrophy [7] and bone loss [8,9]. It is not surprising therefore, that spaceflight puts astronauts at risk for low back pain and disc injury. In National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies, astronauts experience localized (non-radiating) low back pain during spaceflight (43% incidence [10]) and a 2.8-fold higher prevalence of lumbar disc herniation following spaceflight [11]. Yet, the detrimental mechanisms of microgravity on lumbar health are uncertain. Reports of increased post-flight stature suggest that microgravity causes “spinal lengthening” [12,13] perhaps due to accumulated swelling of unloaded discs [14]. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro microgravity simulations which demonstrate increased disc height and passive spinal bending stiffness [15], and in vivo bed rest studies on Earth [14]. It is tempting to conclude that such changes explain the increased risk of post-flight disc herniation, but space studies to date have not been able to demonstrate lumbar disc height changes following spaceflight of either 8 days [16] or 6 months [17] duration. Therefore, how microgravity adversely affects the human lumbar spine remains undetermined. To identify back pain and injury mechanisms, we conducted a longitudinal study of six NASA astronaut crewmembers in whom lumbar spine anatomy and biomechanics were quantified before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on the International Space Station (ISS). Results of this study are valuable not only to inform countermeasures to reduce disc herniation risk in astronauts, but also to provide insights into spine stability that are relevant to improving back health in the general population.Methods Subjects With institutional research board approval, spine imaging and health data were assessed from six NASA astronaut crewmembers at two time points: before launch (“pre”) and 1 day following 6 months’ spaceflight on the ISS (“post”). We followed up with each subject during a mandatory debrief at 1 year following their return to Earth where they self-reported the occurrence and duration of any low back symptoms or injuries within that year. Subjects included one female and five males (ages ranging from 46 to 55 years). No exclusion criteria were applied beyond NASA’s general health and fitness criteria for spaceflight. As such, our sample was uncontrolled for potential comorbidities such as age-related spine degeneration.Magnetic resonance imaging Lumbar spine imaging was performed with subjects lying supine in a 3T scanner with a 4-channel cervical-thoracic-lumbar coil (Siemens Syngo workstation; software Version B19, Siemens AG Healthcare Sector, Erlangen, Germany). Localizer images, sagittal and axial T2-weighted images (TR/TE, 3,010/92 ms; thickness, 4.0 mm; field of view, 220 cm; matrix, 320×320; NEX, 2; bandwidth per pixel, 252 Hz/Px; and fat saturation), and sagittal T1-weighted images (similar parameters as T2, except TR/TE was 2,100/9.4) were acquired. The additional T2 map multiecho sequence was then performed as a single midline sagittal image (TR/TE, 1,800/18 ms; inter-echo delay, 18 ms; echo-train length, 1; section thickness, 7.0 mm; field of view, 22 cm; matrix, 320×320; NEX, 1; and bandwidth per pixel, 260 Hz/Px). Fat saturation and anterior saturation bands were applied. The scanning time for the T2 map sequence was 5 minutes 30 seconds. We measured lumbar lordosis (sagittal angle between L1–S1 cranial end plates on the supine magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), individual disc and vertebral wedging angles in the sagittal plane [17], disc water content (inferred from T2-relaxation maps [18]), Pfirrmann grade (by co-author CWO), the presence or absence of vertebral end plate irregularities (by co-author CWO), cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA as a measure of fat infiltration of lumbar spine extensor muscles (multifidus and erector spinae) at L3–L4. CSA and FCSA data were averaged across four adjacent images at L3–L4. The L3–L4 level was used for our analysis because it was most reliably captured by manual segmentation: there was occasional, inadequate image quality at other lumbar levels. End plate irregularities were scored based on presence or absence of morphologic defects and underlying bone marrow signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images [19]. FCSA was measured by setting a threshold to isolate lean muscle area within the total CSA [20,21]. The interclass correlation for measurement reliability of lumbar lordosis, vertebral and disc wedging, disc water content, and muscle FCSA ranged from 0.89 to 0.99; p<.05. All MRI measurements were done using OsiriX DICOM viewer (Version 8.0, Pixmeo, Bernex, Switzerland) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) software.Dynamic fluoroscopy In separate active (standing) and passive (side lying) postures, we quantified intersegmental flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc. A 12-inch surgical C-arm Vertebral Motion Analysis system (VMA; Orthokinematics, Inc, Austin, TX, USA) captured fluoros-copy videos to measure intervertebral rotation that was measured with vertebral tracking algorithms (KineGraph VMA). Controlled bending platforms achieved passive and active postures, with each subject’s pelvis bolstered to isolate trunk motion. Each subject was guided through a specified range of 70° sagittal and coronal motion, performed at a rate of 5° per second. The measurement reliability of intervertebral rotation from this method has low variability compared with digitized manual techniques with ±1.53° for intra-rater measurements and ±2.15° for inter-rater measurements [22,23].Data analysis All pre-flight variables were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical analyses included paired t tests to compare changes in pre- and post-flight variables among subjects, and simple regression analysis to test for relationships between pre- to post-flight changes for separate variables. Significance was defined as p<.05. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata (Version 13, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) software.Results Lumbar lordosis Following spaceflight, lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) in all six subjects (average change: −11.1%, p=.009; Table). After comparing the sums of lumbar disc wedging (L1–L2 through L5–S1) and lumbar vertebral wedging (L1–L5), separately, we found that neither lumbar disc wedging nor vertebral wedging significantly changed following space-flight, implying that both changed variably in contribution to post-flight decreases in lumbar lordosis. In two of the six subjects, total lumbar vertebral wedging decreased by 8° and 9° (−13% and −23% of pre-flight lordosis, respectively), indicating that vertebral bodies lost height on the anterior border relative to the posterior border.

ROM data are available for only five of six crew and in a few cases is missing from L1 to L2 or L5 to S1 because it was outside the field of view. p-Values are from one-tailed paired t tests. Bolded text indicates statistical significance. Intersegmental range of motion Active (standing) FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004; Table). Passive (side lying) FE ROM did not demonstrate similar decreases for those middle three lumbar discs, but did show a surprising decrease in motion at the L5–S1 disc (−40.0%, p=.03; Table).Muscle atrophy Cross-sectional area, FCSA, and FCSA/CSA of the lumbar extensor muscles (multifidus and erector spinae) changed variably among subjects, with one subject showing an unexpected increase in CSA and FCSA following spaceflight. The remaining five subjects experienced a 20% average decrease in FCSA and 8%–9% average decrease in CSA for both multifidus and erector spinae following spaceflight, but there was not a significant decrease in CSA and FCSA for either muscle when accounting for all six subjects (Table). Changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in the observed lumbar lordosis seen with lying supine (r2=0.86, p=.008, Fig. 1) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007, Fig. 1). Changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA also correlated with lumbar lordosis (r2=0.69, p=.03). In comparison, changes in erector spinae did not relate to changes in supine lumbar lordosis (r2=0.35, p=.22), active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r2=0.21, p=.44), or FE ROM at any other level affected by spaceflight.

This result was true when testing each lumbar level separately and when testing the total lumbar disc water content for each subject (n=6 and p>.05 for all; Table). We also found no effect of microgravity on water content after pooling all the lumbar discs among six subjects (n=30; p=.51) and testing whether Pfirrmann grade had an effect on pre- to post-flight change in water content (p=.072, Fig. 2). Pfirrmann grade, which is in part defined by disc water content, did not change for any lumbar disc during spaceflight. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Change in water content is represented by the % change in T2 mean between pre- and post-flight. We found no systematic relationship between prolonged microgravity and disc water content, with or without adjusting for pre-flight Pfirrmann grade.End plate irregularities and post-flight symptoms We did not find any pre-existing spinal pathologies or Pfirrmann grade to change following spaceflight. Preexisting spinal pathology included only two subjects with end plate irregularities accompanied by positive bone marrow lesions indicative of Type 2 Modic changes (Fig. 3), a condition previously linked to discogenic pain [24]. At a 1-year post-flight follow-up meeting with each astronaut, we learned whether they experienced chronic low back pain or injury following spaceflight. The same two subjects with end plate irregularities were the only individuals to present post-flight symptoms, one reporting chronic low back pain and the other reporting both chronic low back pain and a disc herniation at L4–L5 (Fig. 3).

Example sites for injury and potential sources of pain are pointed out in additional T1-weighted sagittal images (A–C) from two of the subjects who presented post-flight symptoms: (A) indent end plate defect indicated with a yellow asterisk at the cranial L4 end plate, (B) images of post-flight (left) and 30 days recovery following post-flight (right), demonstrating a posterolateral disc herniation indicated with a yellow arrow, (C) T1- (left) and T2-weighted (right) images demonstrated a type 2 Modic change with severe end plate defect (Modic change indicated with a yellow arrow and end plate defect indicated with a yellow asterisk).Discussion This unique longitudinal study underscores the coupled role of passive and active spine stabilizers in maintaining lumbar spine health. We observed that 6 months of space-flight produced significant effects on lumbar biomechanics—the supine lordotic curvature flattened, and the intersegmental ROM decreased. These changes can be detrimental by increasing loads and stresses within the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies [25,26], particularly when re-introduced to gravity upon return to Earth. However, the mechanisms for these post-flight changes surprised us. Our results show that the effect of microgravity on active postural stabilizers (eg, muscle atrophy) may be responsible for post-flight increases in stature and risk of disc herniation, rather than the passive postural stabilizers (eg, disc swelling) as previously hypothesized. We observed that paraspinal muscle atrophy, specifically of the multifidus, was strongly associated with post-flight decreases in lumbar lordosis and intersegmental ROM. The multifidus attaches directly to the lumbar vertebra and acts locally to normally provide the greatest active stiffness in both the sagittal and frontal planes [27–29]. It also has an important role in proprioception and facilitating accurate spine positioning [30]. In this manner, the multifidus acts as a bowstring to accomplish fine adjustment and support of lumbar lordosis [31,32]. Multifidus atrophy in the general population has been linked to chronic low back pain, likely due to alterations in lumbar posture and kinematics [33]. For example, paraspinal muscle atrophy associates with a loss of lordosis [34,35] in patients with degenerative flat back syndrome [36]. The relevance of this mechanism to spaceflight has been previously suggested based on human volunteer studies of prolonged bed rest where multifidus atrophy correlated with loss of lumbar lordosis (approximately 1.5 degrees at L4–L5 [37]). A recent study reported trunk muscle cross-sectional area measured in a single astronaut following 6 months space-flight (not a subject of this current study) and showed that multifidus in the lower lumbar spine decreased more than other trunk muscles [38]. Our current study is the first to demonstrate the strong association between multifidus quality, lumbar lordosis, and intersegmental ROM in vivo. Microgravity-induced lumbar spine flattening has been hypothesized based on external postural changes (“spinal lengthening”) noted in-flight [12]. Our results indicate that lumbar flattening persists following return to Earth and is linked to multifidus atrophy rather than disc swelling. Lumbar lordosis is a morphologic and biomechanical adaptation particular to humans, enabling effective upright posture and efficient bipedal locomotion under gravitational load [16,39]. Lordosis decreases the maximum forces on spinal tissues by distributing load between the disc and facet joints [40–42]. Muscular support actively stabilizes lumbar lordosis while bearing compressive loads by directing axial load along the lordotic alignment [43]. Therefore, it is not surprising that prolonged removal of gravitational loading can adversely affect lumbar lordosis. Reduced lumbar lordosis driven by muscular atrophy may lead to spinal lengthening via postural changes, as well as increased herniation risk due to increased compressive disc loads and potential for exceeding ROM in flexion [25]. Although our work is limited because we do not have precise pre- and post-flight stature measurements, future work will investigate the effect of microgravity on lumbar lordosis in standing posture and overall sagittal balance. Our observation that microgravity primarily influences active spine stabilizers is further supported by comparing intersegmental ROM measured in the standing posture (when trunk muscles are active) versus side-lying posture (when trunk muscles are relaxed). Post-flight sagittal ROM of the middle three lumbar segments (L2–L3, L3–L4, L4–L5) was decreased during standing, but not when lying. These data, plus hydration information available from T2-mapping, indicate that disc swelling does not systematically affect post-flight lumbar spine stiffening, and presumably, post-flight disc herniation risk. Absence of systematic disc hydration increases in our subjects is counter to prior studies where it has long been hypothesized that post-flight changes in astronaut stature arise from supraphysiological disc swelling [12–14]. Our current results, along with recently published data from our team showing negligible changes in disc height [20], demonstrate that disc swelling does not drive changes in post-flight lumbar biomechanics. Prior work on mice demonstrate a degradation of disc biomechanical and biochemical properties following 2 weeks’ spaceflight [44–48], but only in the caudal (tail) segments, which may be deteriorating due to excessive use as a means for rodents to propel themselves around the in-flight cages. Furthermore, in prior work, we compared the biomechanical swelling properties of both lumbar and caudal murine discs and report that only the caudal segments showed degraded biomechanical properties following spaceflight [47]. On the other hand, bed rest studies do show increases in disc size following extended inactivity [49,50], an effect that can persist for up to 2 years [51]. An early study by LeBlanc et al. [50] directly compared the effect of 5 weeks of bed rest and 8 days of spaceflight on disc height. They found that bed rest had an effect, but short duration spaceflight did not. The fact that we did not observe systematic lumbar disc swelling from prolonged microgravity may be due to in-flight exercise protocols that axially load the spine. For instance, exercises using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) help maintain spine and hip bone mass [52]. Yet, although exercise protocols designed for ISS are effective for reducing the in-flight loss of general skeletal muscle mass [53], our data indicate they are not preserving core trunk stabilizers, specifically the multifidus. In addition, ground-based studies of ISS countermeasures on individuals following bed-rest induced atrophy show an insufficient effect on lumbopelvic musculoskeletal recovery [54]. This is not surprising because multifidus atrophy can exist in elite, highly conditioned athletes [55], and given the unique role of the multifidus as a stabilizer to stiffen the trunk rather than create motion, it requires specific training regimens directed toward proper activation [56–58]. Although our results show that spaceflight affects the multifidus for all subjects, we found that the risk for post-flight symptoms may relate to pre-existing spinal pathology. Two of the six astronauts presented post-flight symptoms (Fig. 3) and these two subjects also presented end plate irregularities with type 2 Modic changes in the adjacent vertebral bone marrow. End plate irregularities [24,59] and Modic changes [19] have been linked to chronic low back pain in the general population as they represent regions of structural weakening and pro-inflammatory communication between the disc and bone marrow [60]. Weakening at the disc-vertebra junction could be exacerbated by microgravity-induced changes in vertebral bone quality [48,61] and increased disc loading from lumbar flattening [25] that together heighten risk of failure and injury at the disc-bone interface when reintroducing a relatively less stable lumbar spine to gravitational load. Like many prior studies on subjects exposed to microgravity, this work is subject to limitations in sample size and lack of in-flight data. More work needs to be done to understand whether or not there is significant disc swelling during spaceflight. Although our work indicates that disc swelling is not significantly different following spaceflight, we acknowledge that a considerable amount of changes in disc water content could happen in the ~24-hour period between landing and post-flight imaging. Further work is being done using ultrasound to address disc height during spaceflight. Regardless, our results demonstrate that in spite of negligible changes in disc swelling, significant postural and stiffness changes occurred following spaceflight and related to changes in multifidus muscular stability. Future work involves collecting similar data on additional astronauts and aims to implement countermeasure exercises targeting the multifidus. If multifidus health is maintained during spaceflight, astronauts with pre-existing spinal pathology may be less vulnerable to post-flight symptoms and injury. This prospective study sheds light on mechanisms of post-flight back pain and disc injury—multifidus atrophy appears associated with spinal flattening and increased stiffness. We hypothesize that these factors, when combined, increase injury potential, particularly in those subjects with pre-existing evidence of vertebral end plate insufficiency. These results have implications also for deconditioned spines on Earth. We intend to use these results to develop countermeasures targeting the multifidus muscles and new research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury.Acknowledgments The authors thank Stephen Chiang, Douglas Hughes, Marilyn Johnson, Anjuli Kapila, Scott Parazynski, Roy Riascos-Castaneda, Laura Sarmiento, Richard Scheuring, Alexander Synder, and Ken Walker, for their contributions to this work.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue. Keywords: bone, adaptation, space, microgravity",
    "introduction": "Introduction Skeletal adaptation to microgravity is a physiological obstacle that may limit prolonged space exploration [1]. Studies from astronauts demonstrate variable bone loss corresponding to mission length [2, 3, 4]. Weight-bearing bones such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine and neck lose more bone than non-weight-bearing bones [5], establishing the pivotal role of skeletal unloading on bone remodeling. Physiological studies of the Skylab missions document increasing calcium and phosphate levels in both serum and urine of crewmembers [6], reflecting a gradual loss of bone mineral content in these astronauts. Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years [7]. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts [8, 9, 10]. Development of countermeasures against the osteopenic effect of space travel requires a better understanding of bone adaptation. Human bed-rest is a method used to simulate microgravity without spaceflight. Using this technique, LeBlanc and team demonstrate the greatest bone loss in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, notably the lumbar spine, femur, tibia and the calcaneus [11]. A 60-day bed-rest study reports the greatest loss at the proximal femur and distal tibia [12]. These results are consistent with bone changes induced by spaceflight. Bone measurements on Skylab astronauts show increasing mineral loss in the os calcis corresponding to the length of the mission [4]. A more comprehensive comparison between 18 cosmonauts and bed-rest subjects supports that spaceflight produces similar, if not greater, mineral loss in weight-bearing bones than bed-rest [5]. Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed [4, 11, 13]. To date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body. While modest effort is made to study remodeling of partially-loaded bones (ie: the upper appendages) in response to weightlessness, data on non-loaded bones are scarce and are generated mostly from bed-rest and rodent hind-limb unloading studies. Studies of extended bed-rest and lower-body disuse demonstrate patterns of increased BMD in skull bones along with mineral loss in bones of the lower axial and appendicular skeleton [11, 13, 14, 15]. In their simulated weightlessness experiment, Roer and Dillaman found heavier dry and ash weights of the skulls from hindlimb-suspended rats [16]. However, it is unclear whether the observed adaptations of unloaded bones to inactivity and simulated microgravity reflect the remodeling of these bones in actual microgravity. The present paper attempts to quantify the adaptations of cranial bones to spaceflight. Specifically, our goals are to evaluate the remodeling of skull bones due to actual microgravity, to compare the adaptation of non-loaded bones to actual microgravity versus simulated microgravity as reported in literature, and to quantify these changes based on mineral content and bone volume. We hypothesize that microgravity induces adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight, possibly from headward fluid shifts that accompany actual microgravity.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Control and Spaceflight Groups Experimental protocols conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians. Seven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice representing the spaceflight group (n=7) experienced fifteen days of gravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57-BL/C mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n=8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice – once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice, and the weight change of each animal was determined. After mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within three to four hours of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 hours after launch, and were euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 hours after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC. The calvariae were preserved in liquid nitrogen and shipped to our laboratory at University of California, San Diego for analysis. It should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. Three of the eleven mice were euthanized one day after landing instead of within four hours. The same number of days also held true for three of the eleven ground control mice, which we excluded. Additionally, one calvaria from the spaceflight group suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis. Micro-Computed Tomography Assessment of Mice Calvariae Samples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9μm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction. Bone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm × 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones (Fig. 1, panels A, G and H) by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model [17]), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by calibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab MicroCT scan of a murine calvariae from the spaceflight group presented in different views. Panel A: Calvaria with volume of interest (VOI), which is the rectangular volume placed on the parietal bones to determine calvaria growth. The parietal bones are located at the center of the murine calvaria, flanked by a pair of frontal bones rostrally and a singular interparietal bone caudally. Panels B – E: Transaxial slices taken 0.3 mm apart from the base to the top of the calvaria. Panel E captures the sagittal suture between the two parietal bones. Panel F: Sagittal view of the calvaria. Panel G: Coronal view of the calvaria with the volume of interest. Note the sagittal suture from the joining of the parietal bones. Panel H: Volume of interest is isolated and rotated 30°. Statistical Analysis All computations were performed with SPSS. The effect of spaceflight relative to ground control was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t-tests for the parameters of weight change, BV/TV, Cs.Th and TMD, respectively. Significance was set at p < 0.05.",
    "results": "Results Mice from both the ground control and spaceflight groups were judged to be healthy by a veterinarian at NASA Kennedy Space Center. During the first two days, mice from the spaceflight group decreased their food intake, possibly attributed to shuttle takeoff and the initial experience of microgravity. Their appetite returned to normal after the two-day adjustment period. The ground control mice did not demonstrate any changes in food consumption during the experimental period. In the ground control group, each mouse lost on average 1.51 grams of weight from an average of 26.16 grams pre cage-loading to 24.65 grams at cage-unloading, with an SD of 1.49. Each mouse from the spaceflight group lost on average 2.82 grams of weight from 26.20 grams before spaceflight to 23.38 grams upon mission completion, with an SD of 0.95. None of the mice in either group gained weight. The difference in weight changes between these two groups showed a trend of more aggressive weight loss in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group (p=0.07). Previous studies of weight changes in astronauts attribute most of the reduction to fluid loss (60%), with fat utilization (30%) and muscle catabolism (10%) accounting for the remainder [18]. Comparing murine calvariae, BV/TV was increased (p<0.05) from a mean of 9.64 ±0.79% (Mean ± SD) in the ground control group to 10.48 ±0.47% in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4A). Correspondingly, Cs.Th showed a trend of an increase (p=0.12) from a mean of 0.099 ±0.006mm in the ground control group to 0.104 ±0.005mm in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4B). There was no apparent effect on TMD (p=0.31), with a mean of 0.878 ±0.029g/cc in the ground control group and 0.893 ± 0.028g/cc in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4C). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of ground control and spaceflight groups for bone volume, cross sectional bone thickness, and tissue mineral density. Data are mean ± SD; n = 7 in Spaceflight, 8 in Ground Control groups. Microgravity-induced bone remodeling was reflected by increases in all three parameters we used to define calvaria growth. Compared to their ground control littermates, mice from the shuttle mission showed a relative difference of +8.7% in calvaria bone volume fraction, +5.1% in cross-sectional thickness, and +1.8% in tissue mineral density. Although only the bone volume fraction reached significance, we believe that a mission of longer duration and/or a larger number of samples will better represent the impact of microgravity on unloaded bone (see discussion). Of the three parameters used to determine bone growth, calvaria BV/TV from the spaceflight group exhibited a statistically significant increase of 8.7% (10.48/9.64 – 1) over the ground control group. Cs.Th indicated a trend of increase at 5.1% (0.104/0.099 – 1). Increase in TMD between the two groups was much less at 1.8% (0.893/0.878 – 1). Comparison between the groups shows that in addition to increased average thickness of the calvaria in microgravity, there was also some bone expansion into sinuses within the parietal bones (Fig. 2). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Calvaria from spaceflight group (panel B) showed increase in cross-sectional thickness compared to calvaria from ground control group (panel A). Bone also expanded into the cavity in the parietal bone adjacent to the suture. Despite the more aggressive weight-reduction experienced by the spaceflight group (10.76%) compared their ground control littermates (5.77%), the calvariae from the spaceflight group demonstrated volume expansion, which contradicts the observed changes in the bodyweights between the two groups.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our data support the hypothesis that microgravity causes adaptive growth of murine skull bone, reflected by changes in bone volume and possibly bone mineral density. The increase in bone volume reached significance in the mice exposed to microgravity while the change in cross-sectional thickness did not, possibly due to bone expansion into the cavities of the skull and the sagittal suture. However, this trend in cross-sectional thickness may be strengthened by a longer stay in microgravity. Tissue mineral density did not vary between the two groups, but past studies of weight-bearing bones [19] indicate that changes in this parameter are generally seen with much longer duration of spaceflight. From previous hindlimb unloading studies, we hypothetically attribute the bone remodeling witnessed by us to the head-ward shift of interstitial fluid (ISF) that accompanies microgravity in the absence of gravity in space. Hillsley and Frangos hypothesize that in microgravity, unloading and decreased vascular and ISF flow to weight-bearing bones promotes degeneration while the same fluid forces redistribute to the head to incite growth [20]. Hindlimb-unloading of rats, another ground-based technique to simulate microgravity, causes decreased perfusion of murine distal extremities and a corresponding rostral increase of fluid pressure [21, 22, 23]. By artificially incrementing intramedullary fluid pressure in the femurs of hindlimb-unloaded rats and noting subsequent increases in bone mineral content and size of the femur, Bergula and co-workers establish the capability of ISF flow to alter bone-remodeling independent of skeletal loading [24]. The same principle may be used to explain the remodeling of calvariae in space. Normally weight-bearing bones such as in the lumbar spine decrease in mineral density in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, while bones that do not bear weight such as the skull show increased BMD [25]. The majority of studies that have been conducted to determine the physiological consequences of microgravity discuss the changes specifically in bones that normally bear weight. A study analyzing effects of long-duration spaceflight missions (average length of 176 ±45 days) shows substantial reductions in bone mineral density in several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and leg, resulting in a total body BMD decrease of 0.35%/month [19]. The proposed mechanism for this is an uncoupling of normal bone remodeling with increasing bone resorption without compensatory bone formation [26]. It is possible that staying in microgravity for longer duration will results in more significant changes in the skull. Analyzing calvariae of spaceflight mice allows the comparison with similar studies that use simulated microgravity conditions. Following 17-week horizontal bed rest, several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and the calcaneus suffer mineral losses ranging from 2.2 to 10.4% while an increase of 3.4% is noted in the skull, a finding supported by our data [27]. In the same study, Arnaud and associates implement another flight simulation model with hindlimb unloading by tail suspension to induce a cephalic fluid shift. After 3 weeks of unloading, they determined that bone mineral content is higher in the skull and lower in the hindlimbs. The consistency of our results with these studies is consistent with the ability of bed rest and hindlimb suspension at simulating the effects of microgravity on unloaded bones. Increases in bone measurements following exposure to microgravity are likely caused by head-ward fluid shifts, resulting in a syndrome similar to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as previously discussed [28]. Mader and researchers also discuss the role of cephalic fluid shifts in causing jugular vein distension, leading to a reduction in the pressure gradient between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood flow. The smaller gradient does not allow for sufficient drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure. Our study provides initial insight into the effects of microgravity on non-weight bearing bones. Future studies in this field will include longer flight duration of 30 days on the Russian satellite Bion. However, if limited by lack of spaceflight opportunities, hindlimb unloading of mice and bed rest can serve as valid models for simulating microgravity. By first gathering evidence on the skeletal changes associated with microgravity, it is possible to explore other physiological changes in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause skeletal changes during and post spaceflight in astronauts.",

Copyright notice ID: 4110898 MSID: MS601415 PMID: 23791778 The publisher's version of this article is available at Bone Abstract Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue. Keywords: bone, adaptation, space, microgravityIntroduction Skeletal adaptation to microgravity is a physiological obstacle that may limit prolonged space exploration [1]. Studies from astronauts demonstrate variable bone loss corresponding to mission length [2, 3, 4]. Weight-bearing bones such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine and neck lose more bone than non-weight-bearing bones [5], establishing the pivotal role of skeletal unloading on bone remodeling. Physiological studies of the Skylab missions document increasing calcium and phosphate levels in both serum and urine of crewmembers [6], reflecting a gradual loss of bone mineral content in these astronauts. Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years [7]. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts [8, 9, 10]. Development of countermeasures against the osteopenic effect of space travel requires a better understanding of bone adaptation. Human bed-rest is a method used to simulate microgravity without spaceflight. Using this technique, LeBlanc and team demonstrate the greatest bone loss in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, notably the lumbar spine, femur, tibia and the calcaneus [11]. A 60-day bed-rest study reports the greatest loss at the proximal femur and distal tibia [12]. These results are consistent with bone changes induced by spaceflight. Bone measurements on Skylab astronauts show increasing mineral loss in the os calcis corresponding to the length of the mission [4]. A more comprehensive comparison between 18 cosmonauts and bed-rest subjects supports that spaceflight produces similar, if not greater, mineral loss in weight-bearing bones than bed-rest [5]. Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed [4, 11, 13]. To date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body. While modest effort is made to study remodeling of partially-loaded bones (ie: the upper appendages) in response to weightlessness, data on non-loaded bones are scarce and are generated mostly from bed-rest and rodent hind-limb unloading studies. Studies of extended bed-rest and lower-body disuse demonstrate patterns of increased BMD in skull bones along with mineral loss in bones of the lower axial and appendicular skeleton [11, 13, 14, 15]. In their simulated weightlessness experiment, Roer and Dillaman found heavier dry and ash weights of the skulls from hindlimb-suspended rats [16]. However, it is unclear whether the observed adaptations of unloaded bones to inactivity and simulated microgravity reflect the remodeling of these bones in actual microgravity. The present paper attempts to quantify the adaptations of cranial bones to spaceflight. Specifically, our goals are to evaluate the remodeling of skull bones due to actual microgravity, to compare the adaptation of non-loaded bones to actual microgravity versus simulated microgravity as reported in literature, and to quantify these changes based on mineral content and bone volume. We hypothesize that microgravity induces adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight, possibly from headward fluid shifts that accompany actual microgravity.Materials and Methods Control and Spaceflight Groups Experimental protocols conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians. Seven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice representing the spaceflight group (n=7) experienced fifteen days of gravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57-BL/C mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n=8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice – once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice, and the weight change of each animal was determined. After mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within three to four hours of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 hours after launch, and were euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 hours after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC. The calvariae were preserved in liquid nitrogen and shipped to our laboratory at University of California, San Diego for analysis. It should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/C mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. Three of the eleven mice were euthanized one day after landing instead of within four hours. The same number of days also held true for three of the eleven ground control mice, which we excluded. Additionally, one calvaria from the spaceflight group suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis.Micro-Computed Tomography Assessment of Mice Calvariae Samples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9μm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction. Bone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm × 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones (Fig. 1, panels A, G and H) by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model [17]), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by calibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab MicroCT scan of a murine calvariae from the spaceflight group presented in different views. Panel A: Calvaria with volume of interest (VOI), which is the rectangular volume placed on the parietal bones to determine calvaria growth. The parietal bones are located at the center of the murine calvaria, flanked by a pair of frontal bones rostrally and a singular interparietal bone caudally. Panels B – E: Transaxial slices taken 0.3 mm apart from the base to the top of the calvaria. Panel E captures the sagittal suture between the two parietal bones. Panel F: Sagittal view of the calvaria. Panel G: Coronal view of the calvaria with the volume of interest. Note the sagittal suture from the joining of the parietal bones. Panel H: Volume of interest is isolated and rotated 30°.Statistical Analysis All computations were performed with SPSS. The effect of spaceflight relative to ground control was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t-tests for the parameters of weight change, BV/TV, Cs.Th and TMD, respectively. Significance was set at p < 0.05.Results Mice from both the ground control and spaceflight groups were judged to be healthy by a veterinarian at NASA Kennedy Space Center. During the first two days, mice from the spaceflight group decreased their food intake, possibly attributed to shuttle takeoff and the initial experience of microgravity. Their appetite returned to normal after the two-day adjustment period. The ground control mice did not demonstrate any changes in food consumption during the experimental period. In the ground control group, each mouse lost on average 1.51 grams of weight from an average of 26.16 grams pre cage-loading to 24.65 grams at cage-unloading, with an SD of 1.49. Each mouse from the spaceflight group lost on average 2.82 grams of weight from 26.20 grams before spaceflight to 23.38 grams upon mission completion, with an SD of 0.95. None of the mice in either group gained weight. The difference in weight changes between these two groups showed a trend of more aggressive weight loss in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group (p=0.07). Previous studies of weight changes in astronauts attribute most of the reduction to fluid loss (60%), with fat utilization (30%) and muscle catabolism (10%) accounting for the remainder [18]. Comparing murine calvariae, BV/TV was increased (p<0.05) from a mean of 9.64 ±0.79% (Mean ± SD) in the ground control group to 10.48 ±0.47% in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4A). Correspondingly, Cs.Th showed a trend of an increase (p=0.12) from a mean of 0.099 ±0.006mm in the ground control group to 0.104 ±0.005mm in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4B). There was no apparent effect on TMD (p=0.31), with a mean of 0.878 ±0.029g/cc in the ground control group and 0.893 ± 0.028g/cc in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4C). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of ground control and spaceflight groups for bone volume, cross sectional bone thickness, and tissue mineral density. Data are mean ± SD; n = 7 in Spaceflight, 8 in Ground Control groups. Microgravity-induced bone remodeling was reflected by increases in all three parameters we used to define calvaria growth. Compared to their ground control littermates, mice from the shuttle mission showed a relative difference of +8.7% in calvaria bone volume fraction, +5.1% in cross-sectional thickness, and +1.8% in tissue mineral density. Although only the bone volume fraction reached significance, we believe that a mission of longer duration and/or a larger number of samples will better represent the impact of microgravity on unloaded bone (see discussion).Of the three parameters used to determine bone growth, calvaria BV/TV from the spaceflight group exhibited a statistically significant increase of 8.7% (10.48/9.64 – 1) over the ground control group. Cs.Th indicated a trend of increase at 5.1% (0.104/0.099 – 1). Increase in TMD between the two groups was much less at 1.8% (0.893/0.878 – 1). Comparison between the groups shows that in addition to increased average thickness of the calvaria in microgravity, there was also some bone expansion into sinuses within the parietal bones (Fig. 2). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Calvaria from spaceflight group (panel B) showed increase in cross-sectional thickness compared to calvaria from ground control group (panel A). Bone also expanded into the cavity in the parietal bone adjacent to the suture.Despite the more aggressive weight-reduction experienced by the spaceflight group (10.76%) compared their ground control littermates (5.77%), the calvariae from the spaceflight group demonstrated volume expansion, which contradicts the observed changes in the bodyweights between the two groups.Discussion Our data support the hypothesis that microgravity causes adaptive growth of murine skull bone, reflected by changes in bone volume and possibly bone mineral density. The increase in bone volume reached significance in the mice exposed to microgravity while the change in cross-sectional thickness did not, possibly due to bone expansion into the cavities of the skull and the sagittal suture. However, this trend in cross-sectional thickness may be strengthened by a longer stay in microgravity. Tissue mineral density did not vary between the two groups, but past studies of weight-bearing bones [19] indicate that changes in this parameter are generally seen with much longer duration of spaceflight. From previous hindlimb unloading studies, we hypothetically attribute the bone remodeling witnessed by us to the head-ward shift of interstitial fluid (ISF) that accompanies microgravity in the absence of gravity in space. Hillsley and Frangos hypothesize that in microgravity, unloading and decreased vascular and ISF flow to weight-bearing bones promotes degeneration while the same fluid forces redistribute to the head to incite growth [20]. Hindlimb-unloading of rats, another ground-based technique to simulate microgravity, causes decreased perfusion of murine distal extremities and a corresponding rostral increase of fluid pressure [21, 22, 23]. By artificially incrementing intramedullary fluid pressure in the femurs of hindlimb-unloaded rats and noting subsequent increases in bone mineral content and size of the femur, Bergula and co-workers establish the capability of ISF flow to alter bone-remodeling independent of skeletal loading [24]. The same principle may be used to explain the remodeling of calvariae in space. Normally weight-bearing bones such as in the lumbar spine decrease in mineral density in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, while bones that do not bear weight such as the skull show increased BMD [25]. The majority of studies that have been conducted to determine the physiological consequences of microgravity discuss the changes specifically in bones that normally bear weight. A study analyzing effects of long-duration spaceflight missions (average length of 176 ±45 days) shows substantial reductions in bone mineral density in several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and leg, resulting in a total body BMD decrease of 0.35%/month [19]. The proposed mechanism for this is an uncoupling of normal bone remodeling with increasing bone resorption without compensatory bone formation [26]. It is possible that staying in microgravity for longer duration will results in more significant changes in the skull. Analyzing calvariae of spaceflight mice allows the comparison with similar studies that use simulated microgravity conditions. Following 17-week horizontal bed rest, several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and the calcaneus suffer mineral losses ranging from 2.2 to 10.4% while an increase of 3.4% is noted in the skull, a finding supported by our data [27]. In the same study, Arnaud and associates implement another flight simulation model with hindlimb unloading by tail suspension to induce a cephalic fluid shift. After 3 weeks of unloading, they determined that bone mineral content is higher in the skull and lower in the hindlimbs. The consistency of our results with these studies is consistent with the ability of bed rest and hindlimb suspension at simulating the effects of microgravity on unloaded bones. Increases in bone measurements following exposure to microgravity are likely caused by head-ward fluid shifts, resulting in a syndrome similar to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as previously discussed [28]. Mader and researchers also discuss the role of cephalic fluid shifts in causing jugular vein distension, leading to a reduction in the pressure gradient between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood flow. The smaller gradient does not allow for sufficient drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure. Our study provides initial insight into the effects of microgravity on non-weight bearing bones. Future studies in this field will include longer flight duration of 30 days on the Russian satellite Bion. However, if limited by lack of spaceflight opportunities, hindlimb unloading of mice and bed rest can serve as valid models for simulating microgravity. By first gathering evidence on the skeletal changes associated with microgravity, it is possible to explore other physiological changes in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause skeletal changes during and post spaceflight in astronauts.Conclusion Fifteen days of microgravity aboard the STS-131 mission induced adaptive changes in the non-weight-bearing murine calvaria. Of the three parameters measured, there was a statistically significant increase in bone volume, and a trend of increase in cross-sectional thickness. Tissue mineral density remained relatively unchanged.FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Average weights of the ground control and spaceflight groups before and after fifteen days of cage-loading. Data are mean ± SD; n = 7 in Spaceflight, 8 in Ground Control groups. Fifteen days of microgravity was enough to instigate substantial weight loss in mice. Average weights of the two groups were essentially the same before cage-loading, with the spaceflight group 0.04 grams heavier at 26.20 grams and the ground control group at 26.16 grams. After their respective fifteen days of being caged, the spaceflight group lost an average of 2.82 grams, tantamount to a 10.76% weight reduction. The ground control group only lost an average of 1.51 grams, equal to 5.77% of its pre-caged weight. This striking difference cannot be sufficiently justified by two days of fasting observed in the spaceflight mice at the start of the mission. Continuous systemic response to microgravity including fluid loss, adipose utilization and muscle atrophy from unloading of extremities is a more plausible explanation for the variation between the two groups.Highlights.

    "introduction": "Introduction Among schoolchildren between the ages of 11 and 14 years, the incidence of low back pain is between 24 and 37%.1,2 In school children, risk factors for low back pain include female gender, poorer general health, high levels of physical activity, time spent sitting, backpack loads, and a family history of back pain.3 In the United States, more than 92% of children carry backpacks that weigh between 10 and 22% of their body weight.2,4–8 Of children between 11 and 14 years with low back pain, 82% attribute their pain to backpack use.2 One study correlates low back pain in adolescents with both the backpack weight and frequency of carrying a backpack.4 In contrast, other studies report that back pain in children is related to psychosomatic factors rather than the weight of the backpack.9,10 A recent study investigates the effect of common backpack loads on normal children who never previously reported idiopathic low back pain (ILBP).11 They find that increasing backpack load causes significantly more pain.11 The authors postulate that this pain increase is probably due to the compression of the lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) heights and the increase in lumbar asymmetry observed as backpack load increased.11 Despite concerns that backpacks are associated with back pain in children, there are no radiographic studies of backpack loading in children with ILBP. The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with ILBP. We will then compare these results to previously published normal child data conducted in our laboratory under the same conditions.11 We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a significantly different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods We employed a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to typical school backpack loads in children with ILBP. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner (FONAR Upright MRI, Melville, NY) imaged the lumbar spine. Subjects Four boys and 11 girls, aged 13 ± 3 years (mean ± SD) were recruited from a pediatric spine surgeon’s clinic at a major pediatric referral center. All patients underwent a thorough history and physical exam by a pediatric spine specialist and had anteroposterior/lateral spine radiographs. Similar inclusion and exclusion criteria to the previously published study on normal subjects were utilized with the exception that those in this study had a history of ILBP.11 All subjects were healthy children aged 7 to 17 years old. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified. Child or adolescent assent as well as parental informed consent were obtained per Institutional Review Board guidelines. Subjects weighed 51 ± 12 kg (mean ± SD) and were all between age-adjusted 25th and 75th percentile for height and weight. Experimental Protocol After lying supine for 30 minutes, subjects underwent sagittal and coronal T2 scans of the lumbar spine while supine. Next, a Quadrature planar coil (lumbar; 2.6 kg) was attached to the shoulder strap side of a Jansport backpack (San Leandro, CA; 0.70 kg) via two Velcro straps (0.35 kg) wrapped around the backpack running horizontally and vertically. The backpack was then worn in the 2-strap condition without any waist or chest straps by the subject and adjusted so the weight was mainly on the back and evenly distributed across both shoulders. The subjects were then re-imaged standing wearing the empty backpack. The subjects then repeated the standing measurements with the backpack loaded to 4 kg and 8 kg using ceramic tiles. These loads represented approximately 10% and 20% BW for our sample population. Subjects were unable to bear the 12 kg backpack load (30% BW) due to pain and discomfort. A visual-analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) assessed pain immediately after imaging each condition. The average time for each imaging sequence (supine, standing, 4 kg, or 8 kg) was 10 minutes. Image Analysis Midsagittal MR images were used to measure individual lumbar IVD heights and lumbar lordosis (Figure 1). The midsagittal plane was determined by using the spinous processes as a confirmatory landmark. For anterior disc height, the distance from the most anterior-inferior corner of the upper vertebrae to the most anterior-superior corner of the lower vertebrae was measured. For the posterior disc height, the distance from the most posterior-inferior corner of the upper vertebrae to the most posterior-superior corner of the lower vertebrae was measured. Disc height was obtained from the average of anterior and posterior disc heights according to the Dabbs’ method.12 Disc compression (mm) was defined as the difference in IVD height between the control supine condition and either standing, standing with a 4 kg backpack, or standing with an 8 kg backpack. Lumbar lordosis was defined as the Cobb angle between the superior endplates of the L1 and S1 vertebral bodies.13 Lumbar asymmetry was defined as the coronal Cobb angle between the superior endplates of L1 and S1.11 One independent observer (SS) measured the IVD heights and angles. Measurements were made with Osirix software, version 3.6.1 (University Hospital of Geneve, Switzerland), with a screen resolution of 1024×768 pixels. For each subject, lumbar IVD degeneration was graded by a MSK fellowship trained radiologist (JD) using the Pfirmann system.14 All measurements were carried out blinded to any clinical information or subject data. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Midsagittal upright MR image of subject while wearing 4 kg backpack. Anterior and posterior intervertebral disc (IVD) height as well as the angle of lumbar lordosis are labeled. “A” stands for anterior and “P” stands for posterior. Statistical Analysis To test the interaction between disc height and load, we ran a 6×3 (6 discs×3 loading conditions) two-way repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA). To determine the effect of load on lumbar disc height, anterior disc height, posterior disc height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar asymmetry, and pain, one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the pain scores and L5-S1 IVD heights of subjects with different Pfirmann scores. Supine data for disc compression, lumbar lordosis, lumbar asymmetry, and pain were not included in the analyses in order to isolate the effects of increasing backpack load. All ANOVAs, post hoc Tukey HSD analyses, and linear regressions were conducted using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient to summarize the association between backpack load and disc compression. We used generalized least squares models to compare the differences between ILBP children and previously published normal children data.11 These models were fit with group (ILBP or normal) and backpack condition as categorical variables allowing both heteroskedastic errors at each position and correlation between observations on individual subjects. All generalized least squares models and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were fit with R.15 Pair-wise comparisons between normal and ILBP children were adjusted for multiple comparisons via the method of Benjamini and Hochberg to control the false discovery rate, and an α level of p < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.16 Data are reported as Means ± SEM.",
    "results": "Results In children with ILBP, the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks significantly compressed the L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 1.0 ± 0.2 mm (9.8 ± 3.7 % and 9.9 ± 3.0 %, respectively; p = 0.033 and p = 0.007, respectively) (Figure 2). Backpack load was positively associated with disc compression at L1-L2 by 0.042 ± 0.019 mm/kg (p = 0.042), at L4-L5 by 0.051 ± 0.023 mm/kg (p = 0.042), and at L5-S1 by 0.092 ± 0.018 mm/kg (p < 0.001). Additionally, the 4 kg backpack load significantly compressed the anterior L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 2.2 ± 0.3 mm (12.6 ± 4.7 %; p = 0.036) (Figure 3). Increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the disc height, anterior disc height, or posterior disc height for the other levels (Figure 2–3). The interaction between disc height and load was non-significant suggesting that each disc adapted to increasing loads similarly. One subject was excluded from the lumbar asymmetry analysis due to poor image quality. Increasing backpack loads did not affect lumbar asymmetry or lumbar lordosis (Figure 4–5). Subjects experienced increasing pain with backpack loads of 4 kg and 8 kg in reference to standing (Figure 6; p < 0.001). Pain positively correlated with backpack load (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). IVD degeneration analysis, using the Pfirmann system, graded a 3 for the L5-S1 IVDs of three subjects, while all other subjects IVDs received grades of 1 or 2.14 For each of the three subjects with Pfirmann grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the L5-S1 IVD height or anterior L5-S1 height. As backpack load increased, there was no difference in pain score or L5-S1 IVD height between subjects with Pfirmann grade 3 L5-S1 IVDs and those with grades 1 or 2. Figure 2.

Open in a new tab The 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks significantly increased pain in comparison to the upright condition (* p < 0.05). In comparison to normal children, the generalized least squares models estimated that ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less anterior disc compression at L1-2 to L4-5, and less posterior disc compression at T12-L1 to L5-S1 with increasing backpack load (Tables 1). Additionally, the models estimated that ILBP children experience significantly less lumbar lordosis with 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks compared to normal children (Table 2). Pain with backpack loading was significantly worse in ILBP subjects while standing and at all loads in comparison to normal children (Table 2). The ILBP children could not tolerate the 12 kg backpack due to pain and further testing with that weight was abandoned after attempting to test seven subjects. We found no differences in lumbar asymmetry between the groups while standing or at any load (Table 2). Table 1.

    "discussion": "Discussion In children with ILBP, increasing backpack loads only compress the L5-S1 disc, while in healthy children the same loads compress all the lumbar discs and to a greater extent for most lumbar discs.11 The backpack load is assumed to be taken by the bone, IVDs, or muscles. In a pediatric population with a diagnosis of ILBP, the bone is assumed to be without pathology.17 The IVDs of our population were mostly healthy with Pfirmann grades of 1–2.14 For the three subjects with L5-S1 IVD grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not change the IVD height suggesting that the observed L5-S1 compression in ILBP children is not related to the measured IVD degeneration. Thus, children with ILBP, with healthy bone and IVDs, may alter the distribution of the backpack load from the IVDs to the surrounding paraspinal musculature through a “splinting” effect. Placing the backpack load on the musculature leads to muscle fatigue and subsequent pain. The higher pain scores of ILBP subjects while standing suggests that they are experiencing more pain at baseline. The higher pain scores for these subjects with backpack loading may be due to the added pain of backpack loading to their baseline pain or to their heightened sensitivity to pain. However, because the backpack loads were not randomized, the positive correlation between backpack load and pain may be due to the subject’s awareness of increasing load. Additionally, considering the “splinting effect” hypothesis for ILBP subjects, the increased pain with increasing backpack loads may be due to muscle fatigue. In both normal and ILBP children, increasing backpack load did not change lumbar lordosis. Interestingly, in comparison to normal subjects, ILBP children experience significantly less lumbar lordosis with backpack load. However, it is unclear whether this relates to their ILBP. In ILBP children, backpack load did not affect lumbar asymmetry, while in normal children the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks increased lumbar asymmetry.11 The lack of a difference in lumbar asymmetry’s response to increasing backpack load between healthy and ILBP subjects suggests that the greater pain experienced by ILBP subjects with increasing backpack loads is not due to differences in lumbar asymmetry. Assuming the “splinting” effect is true for ILBP children, the paraspinal muscles are bearing a majority of the backpack load and are subsequently fatiguing. In adults, muscle fatigue leads to changes in muscle recruitment patterns, increases in spinal force, and an increase in spinal instability, which may all contribute to low back pain.18,19 Additionally, the cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles is smaller in adults with chronic low back pain in comparison to healthy individuals.20 Physical therapy (PT) aimed at paraspinal muscle strengthening in ILBP children may normalize the observed back pain with increasing backpack load and possibly redistribute the load to the IVDs. Future studies could test this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of backpack loading on the lumbar spine in normal and ILBP subjects after PT. This study has some limitations. Due to motion artifact, we were unable to strictly control the testing time for each subject, however the average testing time for each condition was 10 minutes. The duration of backpack wear may influence the pain secondary to muscle fatigue. We did not control the time of the day the subjects were tested or the subject’s level of activity the day of imaging. Most of the daily disc height loss while standing occurs during the first hour after rising from supine; our subjects had been standing for at least one hour prior to testing.21,22 However, the 30 minutes of lying supine prior to imaging provided some consistency to our measurements. Additionally, our pain scores were not specific to low back pain and may have encompassed neck, shoulder, and thoracic pain caused by the backpack. Because there is no established grading system for pediatric IVD health, we utilized the Pfirmann grading system for IVD degeneration due to its reliability even though it was designed for adults. The influence of these degenerative discs in the overall pain experience in each patient is unknown. Prior to the MRI, none of the patients were found to have any evidence suggesting disc pathology on the plain radiographs resulting in the diagnosis of ILBP. In children with ILBP, increasing backpack load selectively compresses the L5-S1 disc height. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain in response to backpack load. Whether this is a cause or effect of ILBP, our results suggest altered mechanisms for load tolerance in these subjects. If the backpack load is distributed to the paraspinal musculature in ILBP children, focused PT may alleviate the observed pain with loading.",

Subjects weighed 51 ± 12 kg (mean ± SD) and were all between age-adjusted 25th and 75th percentile for height and weight.Experimental Protocol After lying supine for 30 minutes, subjects underwent sagittal and coronal T2 scans of the lumbar spine while supine. Next, a Quadrature planar coil (lumbar; 2.6 kg) was attached to the shoulder strap side of a Jansport backpack (San Leandro, CA; 0.70 kg) via two Velcro straps (0.35 kg) wrapped around the backpack running horizontally and vertically. The backpack was then worn in the 2-strap condition without any waist or chest straps by the subject and adjusted so the weight was mainly on the back and evenly distributed across both shoulders. The subjects were then re-imaged standing wearing the empty backpack. The subjects then repeated the standing measurements with the backpack loaded to 4 kg and 8 kg using ceramic tiles. These loads represented approximately 10% and 20% BW for our sample population. Subjects were unable to bear the 12 kg backpack load (30% BW) due to pain and discomfort. A visual-analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) assessed pain immediately after imaging each condition. The average time for each imaging sequence (supine, standing, 4 kg, or 8 kg) was 10 minutes.Image Analysis Midsagittal MR images were used to measure individual lumbar IVD heights and lumbar lordosis (Figure 1). The midsagittal plane was determined by using the spinous processes as a confirmatory landmark. For anterior disc height, the distance from the most anterior-inferior corner of the upper vertebrae to the most anterior-superior corner of the lower vertebrae was measured. For the posterior disc height, the distance from the most posterior-inferior corner of the upper vertebrae to the most posterior-superior corner of the lower vertebrae was measured. Disc height was obtained from the average of anterior and posterior disc heights according to the Dabbs’ method.12 Disc compression (mm) was defined as the difference in IVD height between the control supine condition and either standing, standing with a 4 kg backpack, or standing with an 8 kg backpack. Lumbar lordosis was defined as the Cobb angle between the superior endplates of the L1 and S1 vertebral bodies.13 Lumbar asymmetry was defined as the coronal Cobb angle between the superior endplates of L1 and S1.11 One independent observer (SS) measured the IVD heights and angles. Measurements were made with Osirix software, version 3.6.1 (University Hospital of Geneve, Switzerland), with a screen resolution of 1024×768 pixels. For each subject, lumbar IVD degeneration was graded by a MSK fellowship trained radiologist (JD) using the Pfirmann system.14 All measurements were carried out blinded to any clinical information or subject data. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Midsagittal upright MR image of subject while wearing 4 kg backpack. Anterior and posterior intervertebral disc (IVD) height as well as the angle of lumbar lordosis are labeled. “A” stands for anterior and “P” stands for posterior.Statistical Analysis To test the interaction between disc height and load, we ran a 6×3 (6 discs×3 loading conditions) two-way repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA). To determine the effect of load on lumbar disc height, anterior disc height, posterior disc height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar asymmetry, and pain, one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the pain scores and L5-S1 IVD heights of subjects with different Pfirmann scores. Supine data for disc compression, lumbar lordosis, lumbar asymmetry, and pain were not included in the analyses in order to isolate the effects of increasing backpack load. All ANOVAs, post hoc Tukey HSD analyses, and linear regressions were conducted using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient to summarize the association between backpack load and disc compression. We used generalized least squares models to compare the differences between ILBP children and previously published normal children data.11 These models were fit with group (ILBP or normal) and backpack condition as categorical variables allowing both heteroskedastic errors at each position and correlation between observations on individual subjects. All generalized least squares models and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were fit with R.15 Pair-wise comparisons between normal and ILBP children were adjusted for multiple comparisons via the method of Benjamini and Hochberg to control the false discovery rate, and an α level of p < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.16 Data are reported as Means ± SEM.Results In children with ILBP, the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks significantly compressed the L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 1.0 ± 0.2 mm (9.8 ± 3.7 % and 9.9 ± 3.0 %, respectively; p = 0.033 and p = 0.007, respectively) (Figure 2). Backpack load was positively associated with disc compression at L1-L2 by 0.042 ± 0.019 mm/kg (p = 0.042), at L4-L5 by 0.051 ± 0.023 mm/kg (p = 0.042), and at L5-S1 by 0.092 ± 0.018 mm/kg (p < 0.001). Additionally, the 4 kg backpack load significantly compressed the anterior L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 2.2 ± 0.3 mm (12.6 ± 4.7 %; p = 0.036) (Figure 3). Increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the disc height, anterior disc height, or posterior disc height for the other levels (Figure 2–3). The interaction between disc height and load was non-significant suggesting that each disc adapted to increasing loads similarly. One subject was excluded from the lumbar asymmetry analysis due to poor image quality. Increasing backpack loads did not affect lumbar asymmetry or lumbar lordosis (Figure 4–5). Subjects experienced increasing pain with backpack loads of 4 kg and 8 kg in reference to standing (Figure 6; p < 0.001). Pain positively correlated with backpack load (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). IVD degeneration analysis, using the Pfirmann system, graded a 3 for the L5-S1 IVDs of three subjects, while all other subjects IVDs received grades of 1 or 2.14 For each of the three subjects with Pfirmann grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the L5-S1 IVD height or anterior L5-S1 height. As backpack load increased, there was no difference in pain score or L5-S1 IVD height between subjects with Pfirmann grade 3 L5-S1 IVDs and those with grades 1 or 2. Figure 2.

Additionally, the models estimated that ILBP children experience significantly less lumbar lordosis with 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks compared to normal children (Table 2). Pain with backpack loading was significantly worse in ILBP subjects while standing and at all loads in comparison to normal children (Table 2). The ILBP children could not tolerate the 12 kg backpack due to pain and further testing with that weight was abandoned after attempting to test seven subjects. We found no differences in lumbar asymmetry between the groups while standing or at any load (Table 2). Table 1.

In a pediatric population with a diagnosis of ILBP, the bone is assumed to be without pathology.17 The IVDs of our population were mostly healthy with Pfirmann grades of 1–2.14 For the three subjects with L5-S1 IVD grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not change the IVD height suggesting that the observed L5-S1 compression in ILBP children is not related to the measured IVD degeneration. Thus, children with ILBP, with healthy bone and IVDs, may alter the distribution of the backpack load from the IVDs to the surrounding paraspinal musculature through a “splinting” effect. Placing the backpack load on the musculature leads to muscle fatigue and subsequent pain. The higher pain scores of ILBP subjects while standing suggests that they are experiencing more pain at baseline. The higher pain scores for these subjects with backpack loading may be due to the added pain of backpack loading to their baseline pain or to their heightened sensitivity to pain. However, because the backpack loads were not randomized, the positive correlation between backpack load and pain may be due to the subject’s awareness of increasing load. Additionally, considering the “splinting effect” hypothesis for ILBP subjects, the increased pain with increasing backpack loads may be due to muscle fatigue. In both normal and ILBP children, increasing backpack load did not change lumbar lordosis. Interestingly, in comparison to normal subjects, ILBP children experience significantly less lumbar lordosis with backpack load. However, it is unclear whether this relates to their ILBP. In ILBP children, backpack load did not affect lumbar asymmetry, while in normal children the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks increased lumbar asymmetry.11 The lack of a difference in lumbar asymmetry’s response to increasing backpack load between healthy and ILBP subjects suggests that the greater pain experienced by ILBP subjects with increasing backpack loads is not due to differences in lumbar asymmetry. Assuming the “splinting” effect is true for ILBP children, the paraspinal muscles are bearing a majority of the backpack load and are subsequently fatiguing. In adults, muscle fatigue leads to changes in muscle recruitment patterns, increases in spinal force, and an increase in spinal instability, which may all contribute to low back pain.18,19 Additionally, the cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles is smaller in adults with chronic low back pain in comparison to healthy individuals.20 Physical therapy (PT) aimed at paraspinal muscle strengthening in ILBP children may normalize the observed back pain with increasing backpack load and possibly redistribute the load to the IVDs. Future studies could test this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of backpack loading on the lumbar spine in normal and ILBP subjects after PT. This study has some limitations. Due to motion artifact, we were unable to strictly control the testing time for each subject, however the average testing time for each condition was 10 minutes. The duration of backpack wear may influence the pain secondary to muscle fatigue. We did not control the time of the day the subjects were tested or the subject’s level of activity the day of imaging. Most of the daily disc height loss while standing occurs during the first hour after rising from supine; our subjects had been standing for at least one hour prior to testing.21,22 However, the 30 minutes of lying supine prior to imaging provided some consistency to our measurements. Additionally, our pain scores were not specific to low back pain and may have encompassed neck, shoulder, and thoracic pain caused by the backpack. Because there is no established grading system for pediatric IVD health, we utilized the Pfirmann grading system for IVD degeneration due to its reliability even though it was designed for adults. The influence of these degenerative discs in the overall pain experience in each patient is unknown. Prior to the MRI, none of the patients were found to have any evidence suggesting disc pathology on the plain radiographs resulting in the diagnosis of ILBP. In children with ILBP, increasing backpack load selectively compresses the L5-S1 disc height. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain in response to backpack load. Whether this is a cause or effect of ILBP, our results suggest altered mechanisms for load tolerance in these subjects. If the backpack load is distributed to the paraspinal musculature in ILBP children, focused PT may alleviate the observed pain with loading.Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the participation of our fifteen subjects.

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts. Keywords: spaceflight, intervertebral disc, four-point bending, herniation, murine Microgravity exposure during spaceflight negatively impacts the human spine and increases the risk for low back pain and injury. Astronauts experience a 4.3-fold increase in intervertebral disc herniation rate following spaceflight1 (Figs. 1 and 2). Herniation occurs when the annulus fibrosus or cartilage endplate junction is damaged and nucleus pulposus material extrudes through the damaged region. The extruded nucleus material can press on spinal nerves, causing severe pain and often requiring surgery. Disc herniation can be mechanically induced via a combination of hyper-flexion plus compression,2,3 making herniation likely during heavy lifting events in a flexed posture. Figure 1.

Image kindly provided by the authors of ref.25 under the Creative Commons Attribution License.Various phenomena may account for the post-spaceflight increase in herniation risk. Spine unloading due to microgravity exposure is thought to cause supraphysiologic disc swelling and hydration, as suggested by the increased spine length during spaceflight4,5 and disc swelling observed during prolonged bed rest.6 Disc swelling has been shown to place the annulus and intervertebral ligaments in greater tension and limit the range of motion of the spine.7 By contrast, gravity loading increases slack in intervertebral ligaments and reduces the disc’s resistance to bending; consequently, forward bending stresses are 300% lower in the evening than in the early morning.8 Increased tension in the annulus following prolonged unloading may also cause annular tissue degradation and negatively affect matrix production.9 Furthermore, supraphysiologic disc swelling leads to a loss of lumbar lordosis,10 offsetting tensile and compressive differences between the anterior and posterior annulus and increasing tension in the posterior annulus.11,12 Together, these altered disc biomechanics associated with spaceflight may elevate an astronaut’s herniation risk during flexion movements upon return to a gravitational environment. Although imaging and biopsy studies on human astronauts have uncovered a multitude of compositional and geometric changes in the spine during spaceflight including bone loss,13,14 muscle atrophy,13,15 and disc heightening,4 animal models are essential in studying changes in spinal mechanics invasively. Due to limitations of spaceflight research, very few of these animal studies have been performed, most of which use the rodent caudal disc model. For example, Bailey et al. observed that uniaxial compressive creep properties decrease in murine caudal discs post-spaceflight16 and do not recover significantly over 7-day re-acclimation to gravity.17 However, Sinha et al. found that neonatal rats exposed to a relatively short 5-day spaceflight do not demonstrate significant alterations in vertebral compressive strength or disc resiliency as determined by stress-relaxation.18 No studies to date have measured changes in mechanical bending properties of the spine following spaceflight. Given the importance of bending motions for herniation induction, we hypothesized that the biomechanical bending properties of mouse spines following spaceflight are diminished as compared to ground controls. Additionally, we hypothesized that the main site of disc failure is the annular insertion to the vertebra, based on recent work showing this junction to be the most common site of failure in clinical lumbar disc herniations.19 MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals This study was approved by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice (19–20 weeks old) were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice had flown in low Earth orbit on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and were sacrificed 13–15 h after landing. This 13–15 h time period was required to perform initial health inspections and to transport the animals from their landing site in the Orenburg region of Russia to the dissection site in Moscow. Eight control mice were kept on the ground during the same 30-day period in standard vivarium cages (GM 500, Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy). BSP personnel sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. We received isolated frozen tails from the post-flight mice (flight, n = 6) and vivarium controls (control, n = 8).Specimen Preparation The C3–C4 caudal motion segment was isolated from each specimen and thawed. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and X-ray scans were obtained for each specimen to measure disc height as an average of three measurements taken at the center of the disc. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) throughout tissue preparation.Mechanical Bending Tests Each motion segment was placed in a custom 3D-printed four-point bending device such that the plane of bending coincided with the ventral-dorsal plane (Fig. 3). Four 25-gauge stainless steel needles were inserted through the top and bottom parts of the device, perpendicular to the plane of bending, to create the four contact points. The four needles were allowed to rotate freely within the holes so as to minimize longitudinal shear forces. Beam deflection calculations confirmed a negligible (<10 μm) maximum deflection of the needles during the bending tests, and X-rays taken at incremental bending displacements confirmed no bone-on-bone contact. The lower supports of the bending system were spaced 7.5 mm apart, while the upper supports were spaced 2.5 mm apart and attached to the moving cross-head of a materials test system (ElectroForce 3200; Bose, Eden Prairie, MN). Each specimen was carefully placed onto the lower supports and the lower stage was raised until the specimen was just touching the upper supports, as indicated by a load of 0.1 N. Specimens were preconditioned by ramping between 0.5 mm and 0 mm at a rate of 0.05 mm/sec for five cycles in order to create a uniform strain history and allow specimens to situate themselves stably on the supports, then loaded to failure in displacement control at a rate of 0.006 mm/sec. Ramping was terminated after failure, characterized by a drop in force of 1.5 N. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Mechanical testing 4-point bending setup (left) and spacing of bending supports (right).From force-displacement data, the toe region was defined as the displacement corresponding to an applied force of 1 N. This nonlinear toe region has been reported for various annulus fibrosus mechanical studies.20,21 As is generally accepted for aligned collagenous tissues, the nonlinearity in the toe region results from viscoelastic straightening and recruitment of initially lax annulus collagen fibers, and is thus indirectly related to the flexion range of motion of the disc. The bending stiffness was defined as the slope of the most linear region, and the bending strength was defined as the maximum load before failure (Fig. 4). Data from the five preconditioning cycles was used to calculate the maximum load reached during preconditioning. Following mechanical testing, specimens were wrapped in PBS-soaked gauze and frozen. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Representative load-displacement curves for flight and control mice. Toe region displacement and force at failure are decreased for flight mice, while stiffness (slope of linear region) remains relatively constant.Histology Failed motion segments (n = 5 control, n = 3 flight) were processed for histology. The decreased sample sizes for histology analyses were the result of preparing the remaining specimens for MRI scans that proved inconclusive. Specimens were fit into histology molds to maintain their bent position and fixed in formalin. Specimens were then decalcified with a mild ion-exchange agent (Biocare Medical; Concord, CA), embedded in paraffin, and cut into 7-μm thick sections. Sections from various equally spaced locations throughout each specimen were stained with a tri-chrome Mallory–Heidenhain stain containing aniline blue, orange G, and acid fuchsin, and analyzed for failure location. Residual sections were stained with Safranin O. The intensity of Safranin O staining is directly proportional to the proteoglycan content in cartilage; thus, this method was used to assess relative proteoglycan contents in the growth plates of flight versus control spinal segments. Growth plate thickness was quantified using an automated custom MATLAB segmentation script that segments and thresholds the growth plates.Micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) Indication of post-flight vertebral rim fractures noted by histology prompted a μCT bone analysis. Adjacent whole motion segments were scanned using high-resolution X-ray microscopy to quantify bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture (μCT 50, SCANCO Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). Motion segments were oriented with the longitudinal axis of the spine perpendicular to the radiation beam and scanned in 70% ethanol at a 4 μm voxel size using a tube voltage of 55 kVp and an X-ray intensity of 109 μA. Image reconstruction was performed using SCANCO software and scans were analyzed using SCANCO Evaluation Program v6.5-3 to quantify bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular microarchitecture (trabecular number, thickness, and spacing) on each whole motion segment. Subsequently, these same analyses were performed on a trabecular compartment of bone in the metaphysis adjacent to the cranial growth plate of each vertebra to quantify changes in parameters specific to the trabecular bone. This trabecular volume of interest (VOI) was manually delineated using an irregular contour drawn a few pixels away from the endocortical surface. The VOI began just below the growth plate on the cranial end of the vertebra and extended 1 mm (250 slices) towards the diaphysis (Fig. 5). This VOI was chosen rather than isolated epiphyses because murine epiphyses are very small (~0.7–0.8 mm3) and composed largely of cortical bone, which remodels slower than trabecular bone.22,23 The chosen VOI had a larger trabecular volume which improved our statistical power for identifying bone density changes induced by spaceflight. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Representative μCT scan showing the volume of interest used for analysis (light gray) highlighted within the entire vertebra (dark gray). Note the volume of interest only includes the trabecular core.For all analyses, a lower threshold of 300 grayscale units was used to segregate mineralized tissue from soft tissue and scan medium, and Gaussian filters with a sigma of 0.5 and support of two were applied to remove noise. Morphometric indices were calculated using a 3D model-independent algorithm, and BMD was calculated using a linear attenuation coefficient determined by calibration with a SCANCO hydroxyapatite phantom.Statistical Analyses All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Auckland, New Zealand). Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to assess differences in bending strength, toe region length, displacement at failure, and disc height between control and flight groups. Unpaired one-tailed t-tests were used to assess differences in bone parameters from μCT scans by testing the alternate hypothesis that bone loss occurs in microgravity. Univariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess correlations between mechanical bending properties and bone properties, and two-tailed t-tests were used to determine whether regression slopes were significantly different than zero. Significance for all statistical tests was defined by p <0.05, while trends were defined as 0.05 <p <0.1.RESULTS Mechanical Bending Properties Spaceflight reduced bending strength by 17% relative to controls (6.27 ± 0.94 vs. 7.53 ± 1.13 N, p <0.05), shortened the toe region by 32% (0.53 ± 0.13 vs. 0.77 ± 0.21 mm, p <0.05), and tended to reduce displacement at failure (1.01 ± 0.22 vs. 1.35 ± 0.40 mm, p = 0.07), with no significant effect on bending stiffness (p >0.25; Figs. 4 and 6). The maximum load reached during preconditioning was increased by 441% in flight mice (2.14 ± 1.42 N vs 0.40 N ± 0.33 N, p <0.05). Disc height was reduced by 16% in flight mice (0.25 ± 0.03 vs. 0.29 ± 0.04 mm, p <0.05). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Bending strength, toe region, disc height and displacement at failure are all reduced for flight mice (FLT, n = 6) compared to controls (CTL, n = 8). *p <0.05, +0.05 <p <0.1, unpaired t-tests. Error bars represent standard deviation.Histology The two failure modes identified by histology were: (i) annulus avulsion at the disc-vertebra endplate junction, and (ii) separation within the growth plate (Fig. 7). All specimens that failed within the growth plate also underwent fractures in the trabecular bone of the epiphysis adjacent to the failed growth plate. Four of the five control spinal segments failed at the disc-vertebra endplate junction while two of the three post-flight spinal segments failed within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone. Specimens did not preferentially fail at the cranial or caudal ends of the discs. No significant changes in growth plate thickness or proteoglycan content were identified. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Representative histology images showing (A, B) failure at the endplate junction in control spinal segments and (C, D) failure in the growth plate and epiphyseal bone in post-flight spinal segments. (A and C) show the failure locations in the regions bounded by the dashed boxes and (B and D) show the failure locations indicated by arrows. Image parameters: (A, C) 4 × magnification (scale bars: 500 μm); (B, D) 10 × magnification (scale bars: 200 μm). These sections were stained with a tri-chrome Mallory–Heidenhain stain.Micro-Computed Tomography μCT analysis on the trabecular VOI adjacent to the cranial growth plate identified significant post-flight decreases in bone parameters (Figs. 8 and 9). Spaceflight reduced BV/TV by 20% (p <0.05), reduced BMD by 18% (p <0.05), and—most significantly—reduced trabecular thickness by 14% (p = 0.001). Spaceflight had no statistically significant effect on trabecular number or trabecular spacing (p >0.1). Linear regression analyses indicated positive relationships between bending properties and bone quality (Fig. 10). For example, displacement at failure increased with BV/TV (R2 = 0.48, p = 0.05) and with BMD (R2 = 0.45, p = 0.07). Toe region displacement increased with trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.40, p = 0.09). Bending strength also showed a weak positive correlation with BMD (R2 = 0.24, p = 0.22). Regression analyses between bone density and trabecular microarchitecture showed that BMD increased significantly with trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.66, p <0.05). BMD also increased significantly with trabecular number (R2 = 0.72, p <0.05) and—because trabecular number and trabecular spacing are so strongly correlated (R2 = 0.99, p <5.0e-7)—decreased significantly with trabecular spacing (R2 = 0.70, p <0.05).

Displacement at failure increased with (A) trabecular bone volume fraction and (B) bone mineral density. (C) Toe region displacement increased with trabecular thickness and (D) bending strength increased with bone mineral density as trends. Bone mineral density significantly increased with (E) trabecular thickness and (F) trabecular number.Analysis of entire vertebrae indicated a significant 9% decrease in trabecular thickness (p = 0.0008; Fig. 11A), but no significant differences in BV/TV or BMD. Toe region displacement increased significantly with trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.53, p <0.05; Fig. 11B), with no other significant correlations found between mechanical properties and bone microarchitecture. BMD was not correlated with trabecular thickness for the entire vertebrae; however, BMD once again increased with trabecular number (R2 = 0.67, p <0.05; Fig. 11C) and decreased with trabecular spacing (R2 = 0.59, p <0.05).

White squares represent flight specimens and dark circles represent controls.DISCUSSION The results of this study demonstrate that spaceflight reduces the bending properties of spinal segments. The 17% reduction in bending strength may be an important factor for explaining the increased herniation risk in astronauts post-spaceflight, and the 32% reduction in toe region—in conjunction with the 25% reduction in displacement at failure—is consistent with reports of decreased range of motion following bed rest.8,24 The shortened toe region indicates that post-flight specimens built up force more rapidly, causing a leftward shift of the force-displacement curve and a decreased displacement at failure (Fig. 4). Post-flight specimens also reached a 441% higher load during preconditioning, providing further evidence of rapid force build-up and decreased flexibility. Although contradictory to the spine lengthening observed in human astronauts,4,5 the disc height shortening we observed is consistent with other microgravity studies conducted by Bailey et al. using the murine caudal disc model.16,17 Murine caudal discs may not experience the same amount of daily loading as human discs, and thus the change in load in microgravity conditions may not be great enough to cause as much disc swelling as in humans. We were able to visualize the failure location in all seven specimens analyzed histologically. It is well known that physical properties of the annulus are rate dependent, and thus the failure location may change with different loading rates. However, strain rate was held constant and thus did not contribute to changes in failure location among specimens. All specimens failed near the disc-bone interface, presumably due to complicated stress fields and stress concentrations at this junction of dissimilar materials. Control specimens tended to fail at the cartilage endplate junction, which is known to be a source of weakness and the most common location of failure causing disc herniation in humans.19 Endplate junction failure has also been observed in astronaut disc herniations25 (Fig. 2). The weakness of the endplate junction may be due to an apparent lack of structural attachment (i.e., collagen fibers) between the cartilage endplate and sub-chondral bone.26–29 Interestingly, the post-flight specimens did not tend to fail at the endplate junction; rather, these specimens showed tears in the growth plate as well as trabecular fractures in the epiphyseal bone adjacent to the growth plate. This suggests one of two possible failure mechanisms: (i) mechanical bending tore the growth plate, allowing rapid hyper-flexion that induced bony fractures, or (ii) mechanical bending fractured the epiphyseal bone, allowing a fragment of bone to tear away with the annulus fibrosus, bringing along an adjacent fragment of growth plate tissue. Mechanism (i) suggests a decrease in growth plate integrity following exposure to microgravity, while mechanism (ii) suggests bone loss or weakening. Alternatively, growth plate and bone weakening may both occur. The observed shift in failure location for flight mice may explain the reduction in bending strength without a corresponding reduction in bending stiffness. The μCT results support bone weakening as the cause for failure mechanism differences observed between flight and control mice. For the trabecular VOI adjacent to the growth plate, we found that spaceflight significantly reduced BV/TV, BMD, and trabecular thickness. The 18% reduction in BMD we measured is comparable to the 7–15% reductions in BMD reported for rat tibias subjected to 23–30 days of hindlimb unloading.30,31 The most significantly reduced parameter in this study was trabecular thickness, which decreased by 14% for the trabecular VOI (p = 0.001) and 9% for the entire vertebra (p = 0.0007), and is consistent with reports of decreased trabecular thickness in hindlimb unloading models of the rat tibia.31 This thinning of trabeculae may help explain the fractures of individual trabeculae that we observed in failed post-flight specimens (Fig. 6D). The increased significance of trabecular thinning when analyzing the entire vertebra is likely attributed to error reduction over a larger region of bone, as supported by smaller standard deviations. The lack of significant changes in other bone parameters that are not specific to the trabeculae when analyzing the entire vertebra may be explained by the higher amount of bone turnover in trabecular than cortical bone.22,23 In agreement with this, astronauts experience greater levels of bone loss in trabecular than cortical bone.32 Our findings of bone loss following spaceflight agree with various rodent studies showing decreased trabecular bone volume fraction and decreased bone formation resulting in a relative osteopenia following spaceflight.33–35 Bone formation can be inhibited within less than a week of spaceflight, and is correlated with decreased mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins.36,37 Overall, the bone loss following spaceflight we report may explain the tendency of flight mice to fail within the growth plate and bone, as compared to at the endplate junction as seen in controls. We identified various trends between bone parameters and mechanical bending properties. For the trabecular VOI, displacement at failure increased with BV/TV and BMD, and bending strength weakly increased with BMD, indicating that BMD may be a reasonably good predictor of failure risk in bending. For both the trabecular VOI and the entire vertebra, toe region displacement positively correlated with trabecular thickness. This finding is intriguing, because it implies that disc quality (as indicated by toe region displacement) may be related to bone quality (as indicated by trabecular thickness). One possible explanation is that bone loss affects stress distributions in the disc and leads to regions of high stress. This is supported by a cadaver study showing that even minor compressive damage to a lumbar vertebra caused large changes in the internal stress distribution of adjacent discs and generated peaks of compressive stress in the annulus during complex loading.38 The reverse is also true: another cadaver study showed that forces on the vertebral body in motion segments with healthy discs were always distributed evenly, while forces on the vertebral body in motion segments with severely degenerated discs were concentrated anteriorly in forward bending and posteriorly in an erect posture.39 Therefore, any disc degeneration that occurs in microgravity may increase the likelihood of vertebral fracture. The observed correlations between bone parameters and mechanical bending properties suggest that poor bone quality may contribute to herniation risk—a finding that would have major implications for treating and preventing clinical disc herniation injuries. Failure at the endplate junction, which accounts for 65% of clinical disc herniation injuries,19 may be caused by poor structural attachment between the disc and vertebra due to poor bone quality. This idea is supported by the observation that relatively healthy discs are more susceptible to herniation-type injuries than severely degenerated discs,2,3 indicating that the weak link may be within the vertebra. Furthermore, people with low bone density have larger discs,40 presumably because decreased bone strength allows the discs to expand past normal limits. Increased disc size in osteoporotic patients may lead to increased risk for herniation by the same mechanism as disc swelling during spaceflight. Future studies should investigate the relationship between bone quality and disc herniation in human motion segments. Despite its novel and intriguing results, this study has various limitations. An inherent limitation of animal models used in spaceflight missions is the lack of clarity on whether post-flight changes are caused by the same mechanisms as in human astronauts despite anatomical and physiological differences. The orientation of the spine in bipedal versus quadrupedal animals may affect the loading on the spine and—in turn—affect the differences in loading observed in microgravity conditions. However, it is thought that quadrupedal animals may have comparable spinal compression due to periodic upright posture as well as muscle contraction and ligament tension required to support the spine’s horizontal alignment.41 Swelling pressure in bovine discs is similar to human lumbar discs,42 indicating similar-magnitude compressive loading. Furthermore, the average compressive and torsional stiffness values of mouse discs (2–4 MPa and 5–11 MPa, respectively) are similar to those of human discs (3–9 MPa and 2–9 MPa, respectively).43 Due to tissue availability constraints, we only obtained tails and were therefore unable to test lumbar motion segments. Tails of mice may experience less loading from muscles and passive structures. Additionally, while murine caudal discs have a similar average aspect ratio (height/diameter) to human lumbar discs (0.23 vs. 0.24, respectively),41,43 caudal motion segments have a more circular geometry with no posterior elements, which may affect loading. However, in vivo rodent tail force data are lacking. Furthermore, flexion range of motion in the lumbar spine is more constrained due to posterior elements and postural musculature, and thus the bending strength of lumbar segments may be less influenced by microgravity. This would fit with reports of increased propensity for astronaut discs to herniate in the cervical spine, which undergoes larger flexion displacements, versus the lumbar spine.1 However, additional studies are needed for clarification. Aside from geometric differences, rodents differ from humans in that they do not express matrix metalloproteinase-1,41 which is thought to be involved in bone remodeling and may have differential effects on the amount of bone loss in space. In addition, rodents retain open epiphyseal growth plates throughout their adult lives, which limits generalization of growth plate fractures to adult humans with fused growth plates. Mouse discs also retain notochordal cells in the nucleus throughout life, which may affect swelling and viscoelastic properties and, in turn, cause rodent discs to respond differently to mechanical loading than those of humans.41 Lastly, mice are observed to use their tails intermittently to move about inflight enclosures during spaceflight,16 which in theory may overload the tails and accelerate disc degeneration. However, the post-flight bone loss observed in this study indicates that the underloading effect of microgravity outweighs any periodic overloading. A detailed analysis of tail movement during spaceflight and/or inflight force data (measured in vivo or at the walls of the enclosures) would be needed to assess the degree of periodic overloading. It should also be noted that the study design made it necessary to impose two freeze/thaw cycles (one after dissection on landing day and one after mechanical testing) that made it unfeasible to extract reliable biochemical and genetic information from the growth plate and disc. The specimens also re-acclimated to 1-G for 13–15 h before being sacrificed, during which the biochemical properties may be affected by reloading. However, the mechanical properties measured in this study were likely unaffected by the re-acclimation or freeze-thaw cycles, as supported by prior work showing that (i) diminished compressive properties of murine discs during spaceflight do not recover over a 7-day post-flight period,15 and (ii) frozen storage has little to no effect on the elastic response of porcine or human discs,44–46 compressive creep properties of human discs,47 or flexion/extension rigidity of sheep discs.48 Therefore, we are fairly confident that the present mechanical and structure findings are primarily reflective of spaceflight effects and not the reloading phase. It should also be noted that the mechanical testing and μCT analyses were performed on two separate levels of the spine due to study limitations, and that if this had not been the case, correlations between bending properties and bone properties would likely increase in significance. Lastly, the relatively small sample size of mice onboard the Bion M1 mission—and the further reduced sample sizes for histology and μCT due to study constraints—limited the strength of our observations. A post-hoc power analysis indicated that n = 14 specimens per group would be necessary to detect a statistically significant difference in failure displacement (p <0.05 with 80% power). For correlations, we pooled data from both groups to increase the spread and observe overall relationships between bone quality and mechanical properties. While correlations within each experimental group were not significant due to the small sample size, the pooled data indicated overall structure-function trends, some of which were significant and some of which neared significance. Power analysis for correlation coefficients indicated that n = 14 total specimens would be necessary to detect a significant correlation between toe displacement and trabecular thickness, while n = 11 specimens would be necessary to detect a significant correlation between failure displacement and BV/TV. Despite these limitations, this study provides the first analysis of bending properties of intervertebral discs following spaceflight. This study also presents the first measurements of trabecular thickness, spacing, and number in the mouse spine following spaceflight. Our findings have various clinical implications. First, control specimens failed at the endplate junction, which is the most common source of failure in human disc herniation injuries;19,49 thus, our results for the control specimens in this study may provide insight into general disc herniation mechanisms. The decrease in bending strength following microgravity also supports the idea that herniation risk may be higher in the morning when the discs are most swelled,8 suggesting that flexion activities should be limited in the early morning. Additionally, the post-flight growth plate separations we observed in the post-flight mice may provide insight into mechanisms of growth plate fractures in children, which account for 30% of long bone fractures in children prior to growth plate closure.50 Lastly, as previously mentioned, the correlations we observed between bone properties and mechanical bending properties suggest that clinical risk for herniation injuries may be related to bone quality. Altogether, this study’s findings demonstrate that the observed post-flight increase in herniation risk in astronauts may be a result of decreased mechanical bending strength in the disc-vertebra complex. The vertebral bone loss observed in this study may be relevant to astronaut disc herniation by affecting the structural attachment between the disc and bone (Fig. 2). Furthermore, as previously mentioned, bone health affects disc loading distribution,38 and thus astronaut bone loss may negatively affect disc mechanics. These observations motivate development of countermeasures related to monitoring and preventing bone loss during spaceflight and limiting bending movements upon return to Earth. Future studies should determine the time course of bending strength recovery upon return to Earth to improve rehabilitation recommendations.Acknowledgments Grant sponsor: NASA; Grant numbers: NNX09AP11G, NNX13AM89G, NNX14AP25G; Grant sponsor: NSBRI; Grant number: NCC 9-58; Grant sponsor: NSF Graduate Research Fellowship This work was supported by NASA grants NNX09AP11G, NNX13AM89G, and NNX14AP25G, as well as NSBRI grant NCC 9-58 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

    "abstract": "Abstract Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation. Keywords: osteogenesis, angiogenesis, BMP-2, VEGFA, spaceflight, long-duration flight, gene expression",
    "introduction": "Introduction Gravity-dependent retrograde blood flow to upper non-load bearing regions and blood pooling in the brain are linked to increased facial edema, cerebral venous pressure, intracranial blood volume, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF) and stroke volume (Morey and Baylink, 1978; Collet et al., 1997; Miyamoto et al., 1998; Iwamoto et al., 2005; Arbeille et al., 2015; Marshall-Goebel et al., 2019). In addition, altered cerebral hemodynamics account for neurological symptoms common in astronauts that include visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome, post-flight headaches, syncope, dizziness, and impaired cognitive abilities (Blaber et al., 2011; Mader et al., 2011). The skull is in close proximity to cerebral vessels impacted by microgravity and acts as a stress absorber (Tanaka et al., 2004). Although several spaceflight studies have examined the effects of prolonged shifts in hydrostatic gradients in the load-bearing, lower regions of the body (Morey and Baylink, 1978; Miyamoto et al., 1998; Vico et al., 2000; Gerbaix et al., 2018), few studies have examined vascular structural modifications and gene expression in skull bone, also known as calvaria (Kusumbe et al., 2014; Ramasamy et al., 2014). Calvarial syndesmotic sutures are active regions of growth, movement, and repair (Zimmermann et al., 1998). During development, vascularization precedes early osteogenesis on the thin plate of the skull and is followed by the formation of a plate caudal to the first. In addition, resident stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells in the suture mesenchyme contribute to the repair of stressed or fractured calvarial bones by secreting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and recruiting blood vessels and chondroclasts (Doro et al., 2017). In pathological condition or synostosis, the sutures close prematurely resulting in skeletal malformations seen in genetic disorders (Bellus et al., 1996). Clinically, in children with a small skull base, abnormal calvarial growth and cerebral perfusion increases intracranial pressure (ICP), a trend seen in astronauts (Pierre-Kahn et al., 1980; Sainte-Rose et al., 1984). 30 days of spaceflight have been shown to exacerbate these processes, where an elevation of brain arterial flow increases stiffness, myogenic vasoconstriction, and maximal diameter of the cerebral arteries as mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanisms (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). Our previous work showed a 30% increase in calvarial bone mineral density in mice after 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 flight (Zhang et al., 2013).However, there are few reports on bone vascular adaptations to microgravity at a multi-scale level (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). Based on the state-of-the-research, we propose that calvarial bone and vascular remodeling occurs in response to skeletal unloading, cephalad fluid shifts, and elimination of gravity-oriented hydrostatic gradients. However, the exact adaptation of calvarial vasculature to cephalad fluid shifts is not yet fully characterized. In this line of inquiry, we examine the adaptations in vascular morphology, capillarization, and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in mouse calvaria exposed to microgravity using image morphometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We also provide a comprehensive protocol for the isolation of RNA from thick skull bone tissue in quantities sufficient for determining calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated gene responses.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Experiments were performed on two groups of mice, one flown on NASA’s STS-131 flight for 15 days and the other on the BION-M1 flight for 30 days, and each spaceflight (SF) cohort was associated with a terrestrial ground control (GC). The time scale from loading the mice on Earth, landing, distribution of tissue and calvarial measurements for mice from both flights are illustrated in Figure 1 (Panels A and B). The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) as well as the IACUCs of Moscow State University and NASA. The experimental protocols were conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians certified all STS-131 mice as healthy prior to flight, while BION-M1 mice were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Schematic of the timeline for STS-131 and BION-M1 missions and associated design of spaceflight experiments. The Discovery vehicle launched for STS-131 on 5 April 2010 carrying 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice. At the conclusion of a 15-day orbital flight, Discovery landed and experimental subjects were collected. Following euthanization, mouse tissue was dissected and distributed to participating laboratories. We received the mouse calvaria and performed µCT and immunohistochemistry analysis on the calvaria. Next, 19–20 week-old male mice were aboard the BION-M1 spaceflight for 30 days before landing, tissue dissection and distribution. The mouse calvaria were transported in RNA later to our lab for µCT, histochemistry, and gene expression analysis. Animals STS-131 Flight The STS-131 flight included eight C57BL/6 female mice (16–23 week-old; Charles River, Raleigh, NC, United States). Age-matched GC mice were housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle in an Animal Enclosure Modules situated in Discovery’s middeck and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum. All the mice were weighed before cage loading and again after cage unloading before euthanizing the mice on the ground. After 15 days, STS-131 returned to NASA-KSC and SF mice were distributed to multiple investigators, euthanized, and tissues harvested within 3–4 h. The Biospecimen Sharing Project (BSP), enabled mice tissue sharing among different investigators from different campuses. BION-M1 Flight Of the eleven, 19–20 week-old male wild-type, pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice, five were flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite. The remaining five mice comprising the GC were maintained terrestrially. Both SF and GC groups were housed under identical conditions in Russian Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS) habitats on a 12-h light-dark cycle in identical environmental conditions and consumed a paste food diet containing 74.6% H2O developed by Russia’s IBMP. SF mice were loaded onto the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite and launched on 19 April 2013 on a Soyuz 2-1a rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome and returned on 19 May 2013 in the Orenburg region of Russia. The BOS habitats were then used to house the GC mice. 13–15 h after return to Earth, study subjects were transported to Moscow, Russia and euthanized. Investigators from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) dissected the calvaria and prepared samples for transport either in RNA later (for quantitative real time PCR analysis) or frozen at −80°C (for lectin staining). The exact details of the BION-M1 experiment is thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Fenestrae Measurements From Micro-computed Tomography of the Mice Calvaria The diameter of the skull fenestra were measured from microCT images obtained previously by (Macaulay et al., 2017). The detailed protocol for the preparation of the BION-M1 mice calvaria, volume of interest and the plane used for microCT imaging is provided elsewhere (Macaulay et al., 2017). Briefly, calvariae were moistened with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and wrapped in tissue paper and scanned with a 9 μm voxel size, an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200 μA, and a 0.5 mm aluminum filter. The parietal section of the calvarial structure flanked rostrally by two frontal bones and caudally by a single bone were imaged on micro-computed tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Bruker μCT, Kontich, Belgium) according to the established guidelines (Bouxsein et al., 2010). A volume of interest (VOI) in the centre of the parietal sections measuring 18 mm3, 5.5 mm × 1.2 mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7 mm depth was imaged. The centre was identified by the anterior lamboid and coronal sutures intersection. Histomorphetric measurements of bone structure and thickness was determined SkyScan CT-analyser and DataViewer software. The diameter of the fenestrae on either sides of central sutures were examined qualitatively by drawing a white dotted line around each fenestrae and determining the diameter across the fenestrae. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining The BION-M1 calvarial samples were extracted from the sacrificed mice after touchdown and transported to the laboratory in 10% formalin. The tissue was then decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution for 4 weeks. The tissues were dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections were made along the suture region with a thickness of 7 μM and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lectin Staining of the Calvaria The calvarial sections from the BION-M1 mice were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS and washed three times with PBS. The sections were then permeabilized in PBT (PBS, 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated with FITC-conjugated BS1-B4 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4 C overnight. The tissue sections were then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). The parietal cross sections were 7 μm thick and sectioned as duplicates on a single slide. The negative controls were sections without FITC-conjugated BSI-B4. The parasagittal vessels were counted manually and diameter measured throughout the calvarial section (30–38 fields/slide, n = 9 animals for STS-131 and n = 10 animals for BION-M1) by a random-blinded observer in a random manner using the free hand tool of ImageJ software. The pictures were taken with a 40x magnification using a Olympus B×51 FL microscope. Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) The frontal and parietal portion of 5 GC mice and five S F mice from the BION-M1 flight were dissected and stored in RNA post-flight. The broad parietal section (both the bones) of the calvarial tissue samples were then powdered in a homogenizer and transferred to Eppendorf tubes filled with Trizol®, after which samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and prevented from thawing. Following arrival at the distributed laboratories, samples were thawed and treated in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) for 30 min to completely disassociate the nucleoprotein complex. After 30 min, the samples were pipetted about 20 times and kept at room temperature (RT) for 2 min 200μL of chloroform was added to Trizol® and agitated for 15 s by hand. The samples were kept at RT for another 2 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 70% ethanol. After the total RNA was precipitated, the solution was transferred to an RNA-binding column and RNA purification was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Purelink RNA, Life technologies). The pure RNA was eluted from the columns in 30 μL of RNase-free water, and the RNA concentration and purity was estimated using nanodrop. Normalized RNA (1 mg/ml) was converted into cDNA using a Qiagen kit with a gDNA wipeout buffer. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C for 30 min per manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting cDNA was stored at −20°C or used immediately. The gene expression analysis was carried out using SYBR green (2x QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR, Qiagen) in a 96-well format on an Eppendorf Mastercycler. Primer sequences used for real time PCR are listed in Table 1 and sourced from IDT Technologies. The annealing temperature was standardized at 57°C for 15 s except RUNX2 and OCN for which the annealing temperature was 58°C for 15 s. The results were normalized with 18s RNA and GAPDH housekeeping genes; the experiment was run in triplicates and Livak’s method was used to calculate the difference in expression between SF and GC mice.

    "results": "Results Changes in Vascular Morphology in Mouse Calvaria after 15 and 30 days of Spaceflight Our previous µCT analysis on STS-131 S F calvaria show that 15 days of spaceflight results in a 30% increase in bone volume in spaceflight mice calvaria compared to control mice (Zhang et al., 2013). However, 30 days of spaceflight in BION-M1 did not show remarkable differences in bone volume and thickness (Macaulay et al., 2017). To determine the spaceflight associated vascular effects in mice calvaria, we first qualitatively compared the size of the parietal fenestrae of BION-M1 previously occupied by the vessels from the BION-M1 µCT micrographs (Macaulay et al., 2017). The bone thickness and bone volume of BION-M1 mice calvarial sections are published elsewhere (Macaulay et al., 2017). The scanned µCT micrographs of calvarial sections from GC and SF mice showed decreases in the size of fenestrae around the parietal sutures apart from the appearance of increases in cross-sectional thickness in the representative SF group compared to GC group (Figure 2A, Panels A and B).

The arrows are pointing to the size of the fenestrae (C,D) Eosin hematoxylin staining of the frontal section of the parietal region showing two large venules, arteriole, numerous foci, and cell nucleus within the suture surrounded by loose connective tissue (E,F) Isolectin-IB4 staining of the parietal sections of the mice calvaria; labeling of both large and small vessels is shown with a dotted white line (G–J) Measurements of isolectin-IB4-stained blood vessel diameter and capillary number performed on ≥15–20 microscope images per slide section (n = 2 sections/slide) for a total of eight STS-131 mice exposed to 15 days microgravity (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 4) and 10 BION-M1 mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity (GC, n = 5; SF, n = 5). The values are expressed in mm. The data are represented as mean ± SE, *p = 0.02. The images were obtained with a 4x objective lens and depict fenestrae containing calvarial vessels. Scale bar is 2 mm and the width of the section is 2 mm.Further qualitative histological examination of the bone trabeculae along the suture showed a number of foci, nucleus and empty spaces left by dead cells in the suture region and the bone plates (Figure 2A, Panel C and D). Next, we quantified parasagittal vessel structural and molecular vascular adaptations to 15-day and 30-day spaceflight by immunostaining capillaries in the sagittal suture section of the mice calvaria with, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin isolectin-B4 as a fluorescent endothelial cell marker (Figure 2A, Panels E and F). Manual, double-blinded quantification of Lectin B4-stained parasagittal vessels of the mice calvaria showed a significant increase in vessel numbers in SF mice compared to GC in the STS- 131 mice cohort (GC: 6 ± 2 vessels/mm2, SF: 10 ± 6 vessels/mm2; n = 4, *p = 0.054, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2B). The vessel diameters in bone trabeculae are reduced 4-fold in SF compared to GC in STS-131 tissues (15–20 images, two sections/slide, *p = 0.02) (Figure 2A, Panel C). In BION-M1 mice calvaria, there were no significant differences in the diameter or the number of vessels between GC and SF mice (GC: 20 ± 14 vessels/mm2, SF: 16 ± 8 vessels/mm2; n = 5, *p > 0.05, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2C). Capillarization is increased and diameter of the vessel is decreased in the STS-131 S F population while no significant change in the vessel numbers or diameter occurs in BION-M1 SF mice. Microgravity-Associated Alterations in Calvaria Gene Expression Related to Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis To determine the effects of cephalad fluid shifts on calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis associated gene expression, VEGFA, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), BMP-2, dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), RUNX2 and OCN were examined using qPCR in central parietal section of calvaria samples from GC and BION-M1 SF mice. Pro-angiogenic VEGFA expression increases 15 folds in SF compared to GC mice (Figure 3, Panel A). Concomitantly, BMP-2 gene expression increases 11 fold in SF compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel C). RUNX2, required for osteoblast differentiation, also increases 2-fold in SF mice compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel D). DMP1 is involved in the regulation of bone formation and is upregulated in SF mice (Figure 3, Panel F). OCN remained unchanged in GC and SF mice. The material was insufficient to analyze SOST expression, involved in anabolic activity of bone. In sum, both angiogenic and osteogenic genes in the calvaria are upregulated in response to spaceflight-related fluid shifts. FIGURE 3.

    "discussion": "Discussion Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure. Unloaded regions of the body such as calvaria show an 30% increase in bone volume when exposed to spaceflight conditions compared to ground controls (Zhang et al., 2013), suggesting differential regulation of load bearing and unloaded regions of the body. Previous work has shown impaired cerebral perfusion and blood distribution based on structural modifications of vessels in the brain due to head-ward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). The mechanosensitivity of bone cells to compressive forces and subsequent increase in bone formation in response to mechanical stimuli is known, calvarial adaptations to cephalad fluid shifts, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebrovascular regulation due to microgravity exposure are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we describe for the first time calvarial vascular morphological alterations in mice exposed to STS-131 conditions, along with angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated calvarial gene expression changes in mice from BION-M1. Consensus is lacking on the exact effects of microgravity on cerebrovascular regulation as the results from different models are inconsistent. Most of the interpretation of the data is based on patterns derived from other pathologies (Du et al., 2021). Consensus points to fluid redistribution and blood pooling in the brain in the absence of hydrostatic gradients as precipitating the neurological and pathological conditions associated with microgravity. Spaceflight reduces bone mineral density in the lower load-bearing musculoskeletal regions compared to non-load bearing regions such as the skull (LeBlanc et al., 2000; Vico et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2013). Mouse skull is a rarely studied structure in spite of its abundance of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as its structural and functional roles during homeostasis and repair. Calvarial thickness and suture growth is age-dependent and progressive (Alberius and Johnell, 1990). The suture section of the calvarial parietal bone consists of the maximum density of the capillaries which support bone development and is therefore suitable for studying vessel morphology and number. The suture in the calvaria is heavily vascularized with small central vessels (Alberius and Johnell, 1990). Lectin binding to the glycoconjugates of endothelial cells plasmalemma allow for a simple method for the visualization of morphology. Therefore, we used lectin stain to label calvarial blood vessels. Blood vessel diameter is up- or downregulated depending on the intensity and direction of blood flow. Correspondingly, our study demonstrated reductions in calvarial blood vessel diameter in STS-131 S F mice as a response to increase in demands for blood flow and bone volume. Our data showed differential profiles for vessel diameters and numbers in the calvarial sections of mice included on STS-131 (15-day) or BION-M1 (30-day). In STS-131 mice, the vessel diameter was reduced and capillarization increased, a trend suggesting calvarial vessel remodeling and capillarization in the bone trabeculae concomitant to increase in calvarial bone mass identified in early study (Zhang et al., 2013). Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal link between expression of angiogenic markers and bone formation (Cackowski et al., 2010; Moser et al., 2018). During injury or stress, resident suture stem cells secrete VEGF and recruit blood vessels to facilitate repair; VEGF stimulates the proliferation of osteoblast and increased VEGF levels are observed at the proliferative stage of bone repair, and this vascularization is essential for tissue recovery and repair. Insufficient or incongruous formation of bone blood vessels leads to irregular bone formation and increased risk of bone fractures (Stegen et al., 2015). The regeneration of vascular supply through vascularization in parallel with osteogenesis is central in the formation of the new functional bone (Amini et al., 2012). Alterations in VEGFA expression correlates with the number of vessels in spaceflight calvaria in the STS-131 flight mice (Figure 2B). Local application of exogenous recombinant BMP2 completely regenerates calvarial defects in a rodent model and is important in tissue healing and restoration. In humans, BMP2 recombinant protein can regenerate mandibular continuity and cleft palate defects (Boyne, 2001; Dickinson et al., 2008; Herford and Boyne, 2008). BMP-2 addition dramatically increases Osteocalcin (OCN) which in turn is responsible for the pro-osteogenesis function of BMP2. BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through RUNX2 expression which directly regulates osteocalcin expression to increase bone formation. RUNX2 is a global regulator of osteogenesis and is crucial for regulating the expression of bone-specific genes. Autocrine BMP production is necessary for the Runx2 transcription factor to be active. Runx2 executes and completes BMP2 signaling for osteoblast differentiation. The co-ordinated activity of Runx2 and BMP2 activated SMADS are critical in bone remodeling and skeleton formation. Taken together, endogenous BMP signaling enhances bone formation and regulation of BMP activity in the postnatal stages is critical for normal bone formation. While acknowledging that there may be site specific and bone dependent differences described by others (Quarto et al., 2010; Kwan et al., 2011; Niziolek et al., 2011), we show that the parietal region of the mice calvaria are sensitive to fluctuations in fluid shifts and results bone vascular responses. Microgravity-mediated cephalad fluid shift results in high intracranial pressure which may affect vessel morphology. Cerebral vasomotor and mechanical properties, deficiencies in femoral muscle regeneration and defective immune response occurs after 30 days of BION-M1 spaceflight (Sofronova et al., 1985; Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014; Markina et al., 2018; Radugina et al., 2018; Tascher et al., 2019). Contrary to this finding, our µCT data of the BION-M1 mice suggests that the calvarial bone structure remain unchanged. However the gene expression of sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation, is higher in the spaceflight group based on our previous results (Macaulay et al., 2017) implying the possibility of both anabolic and catabolic activity of sclerostin. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that loss of sclerostin increases cranial bone growth and regeneration and sclerostin antibodies are used to increase bone mass in clinical trials of osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta (Kang et al., 2018; Scheiber et al., 2019) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in bone formation. One of the mechanisms of bone regeneration is the recruitment of stromal and hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow (Markina et al., 2018). The proliferative capacity of the bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic precursors decreases in the BION-M1 mouse population cohort of mice (Markina et al., 2018) which may explain our findings that the vessel diameter and number of vessels are unchanged in BION-M1 compared to STS-131 (Figure 2). The molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological adaptations of calvarial vessels and bone to cephalad fluid shifts remain poorly understood.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion This work describes microgravity-associated alterations in pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic gene expression in an unloaded bone region in two wild-type study populations. These results suggest skull vasculature and bone as a sensor for gravity and cephalad fluid shifts, outcomes that highlight the importance of the development of countermeasures for long-duration spaceflight. An in-depth, gender-based study of mouse calvaria that includes genomic, proteomic and metabolomic components will further characterize pathways involved in the increase in calvaria growth seen in study populations exposed to microgravity. Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria. The finding is relevant in the development of countermeasures for prolonged crewed spaceflight and to understand the molecular and structural adaptations of bone and vasculature to the microgravity environment. Lastly, there is a need to monitor the entire astronaut skeletal system on a meta-scale and in a spatio-temporal manner; this type of inquiry will leverage the site-specific, heterogenic skeletal responses and the sufficiency of short-term microgravity exposure to induce upregulation of angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression.",

Copyright notice ID: 9139491 PMID: 35634164 Abstract Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation. Keywords: osteogenesis, angiogenesis, BMP-2, VEGFA, spaceflight, long-duration flight, gene expressionIntroduction Gravity-dependent retrograde blood flow to upper non-load bearing regions and blood pooling in the brain are linked to increased facial edema, cerebral venous pressure, intracranial blood volume, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF) and stroke volume (Morey and Baylink, 1978; Collet et al., 1997; Miyamoto et al., 1998; Iwamoto et al., 2005; Arbeille et al., 2015; Marshall-Goebel et al., 2019). In addition, altered cerebral hemodynamics account for neurological symptoms common in astronauts that include visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome, post-flight headaches, syncope, dizziness, and impaired cognitive abilities (Blaber et al., 2011; Mader et al., 2011). The skull is in close proximity to cerebral vessels impacted by microgravity and acts as a stress absorber (Tanaka et al., 2004). Although several spaceflight studies have examined the effects of prolonged shifts in hydrostatic gradients in the load-bearing, lower regions of the body (Morey and Baylink, 1978; Miyamoto et al., 1998; Vico et al., 2000; Gerbaix et al., 2018), few studies have examined vascular structural modifications and gene expression in skull bone, also known as calvaria (Kusumbe et al., 2014; Ramasamy et al., 2014). Calvarial syndesmotic sutures are active regions of growth, movement, and repair (Zimmermann et al., 1998). During development, vascularization precedes early osteogenesis on the thin plate of the skull and is followed by the formation of a plate caudal to the first. In addition, resident stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells in the suture mesenchyme contribute to the repair of stressed or fractured calvarial bones by secreting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and recruiting blood vessels and chondroclasts (Doro et al., 2017). In pathological condition or synostosis, the sutures close prematurely resulting in skeletal malformations seen in genetic disorders (Bellus et al., 1996). Clinically, in children with a small skull base, abnormal calvarial growth and cerebral perfusion increases intracranial pressure (ICP), a trend seen in astronauts (Pierre-Kahn et al., 1980; Sainte-Rose et al., 1984). 30 days of spaceflight have been shown to exacerbate these processes, where an elevation of brain arterial flow increases stiffness, myogenic vasoconstriction, and maximal diameter of the cerebral arteries as mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanisms (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). Our previous work showed a 30% increase in calvarial bone mineral density in mice after 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 flight (Zhang et al., 2013).However, there are few reports on bone vascular adaptations to microgravity at a multi-scale level (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). Based on the state-of-the-research, we propose that calvarial bone and vascular remodeling occurs in response to skeletal unloading, cephalad fluid shifts, and elimination of gravity-oriented hydrostatic gradients. However, the exact adaptation of calvarial vasculature to cephalad fluid shifts is not yet fully characterized. In this line of inquiry, we examine the adaptations in vascular morphology, capillarization, and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in mouse calvaria exposed to microgravity using image morphometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We also provide a comprehensive protocol for the isolation of RNA from thick skull bone tissue in quantities sufficient for determining calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated gene responses.Materials and Methods Experiments were performed on two groups of mice, one flown on NASA’s STS-131 flight for 15 days and the other on the BION-M1 flight for 30 days, and each spaceflight (SF) cohort was associated with a terrestrial ground control (GC). The time scale from loading the mice on Earth, landing, distribution of tissue and calvarial measurements for mice from both flights are illustrated in Figure 1 (Panels A and B). The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) as well as the IACUCs of Moscow State University and NASA. The experimental protocols were conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians certified all STS-131 mice as healthy prior to flight, while BION-M1 mice were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Schematic of the timeline for STS-131 and BION-M1 missions and associated design of spaceflight experiments. The Discovery vehicle launched for STS-131 on 5 April 2010 carrying 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice. At the conclusion of a 15-day orbital flight, Discovery landed and experimental subjects were collected. Following euthanization, mouse tissue was dissected and distributed to participating laboratories. We received the mouse calvaria and performed µCT and immunohistochemistry analysis on the calvaria. Next, 19–20 week-old male mice were aboard the BION-M1 spaceflight for 30 days before landing, tissue dissection and distribution. The mouse calvaria were transported in RNA later to our lab for µCT, histochemistry, and gene expression analysis.Animals STS-131 Flight The STS-131 flight included eight C57BL/6 female mice (16–23 week-old; Charles River, Raleigh, NC, United States). Age-matched GC mice were housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle in an Animal Enclosure Modules situated in Discovery’s middeck and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum. All the mice were weighed before cage loading and again after cage unloading before euthanizing the mice on the ground. After 15 days, STS-131 returned to NASA-KSC and SF mice were distributed to multiple investigators, euthanized, and tissues harvested within 3–4 h. The Biospecimen Sharing Project (BSP), enabled mice tissue sharing among different investigators from different campuses.BION-M1 Flight Of the eleven, 19–20 week-old male wild-type, pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice, five were flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite. The remaining five mice comprising the GC were maintained terrestrially. Both SF and GC groups were housed under identical conditions in Russian Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS) habitats on a 12-h light-dark cycle in identical environmental conditions and consumed a paste food diet containing 74.6% H2O developed by Russia’s IBMP. SF mice were loaded onto the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite and launched on 19 April 2013 on a Soyuz 2-1a rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome and returned on 19 May 2013 in the Orenburg region of Russia. The BOS habitats were then used to house the GC mice. 13–15 h after return to Earth, study subjects were transported to Moscow, Russia and euthanized. Investigators from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) dissected the calvaria and prepared samples for transport either in RNA later (for quantitative real time PCR analysis) or frozen at −80°C (for lectin staining). The exact details of the BION-M1 experiment is thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014).Fenestrae Measurements From Micro-computed Tomography of the Mice Calvaria The diameter of the skull fenestra were measured from microCT images obtained previously by (Macaulay et al., 2017). The detailed protocol for the preparation of the BION-M1 mice calvaria, volume of interest and the plane used for microCT imaging is provided elsewhere (Macaulay et al., 2017). Briefly, calvariae were moistened with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and wrapped in tissue paper and scanned with a 9 μm voxel size, an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200 μA, and a 0.5 mm aluminum filter. The parietal section of the calvarial structure flanked rostrally by two frontal bones and caudally by a single bone were imaged on micro-computed tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Bruker μCT, Kontich, Belgium) according to the established guidelines (Bouxsein et al., 2010). A volume of interest (VOI) in the centre of the parietal sections measuring 18 mm3, 5.5 mm × 1.2 mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7 mm depth was imaged. The centre was identified by the anterior lamboid and coronal sutures intersection. Histomorphetric measurements of bone structure and thickness was determined SkyScan CT-analyser and DataViewer software. The diameter of the fenestrae on either sides of central sutures were examined qualitatively by drawing a white dotted line around each fenestrae and determining the diameter across the fenestrae.Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining The BION-M1 calvarial samples were extracted from the sacrificed mice after touchdown and transported to the laboratory in 10% formalin. The tissue was then decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution for 4 weeks. The tissues were dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections were made along the suture region with a thickness of 7 μM and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.Lectin Staining of the Calvaria The calvarial sections from the BION-M1 mice were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS and washed three times with PBS. The sections were then permeabilized in PBT (PBS, 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated with FITC-conjugated BS1-B4 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4 C overnight. The tissue sections were then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). The parietal cross sections were 7 μm thick and sectioned as duplicates on a single slide. The negative controls were sections without FITC-conjugated BSI-B4. The parasagittal vessels were counted manually and diameter measured throughout the calvarial section (30–38 fields/slide, n = 9 animals for STS-131 and n = 10 animals for BION-M1) by a random-blinded observer in a random manner using the free hand tool of ImageJ software. The pictures were taken with a 40x magnification using a Olympus B×51 FL microscope.Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) The frontal and parietal portion of 5 GC mice and five S F mice from the BION-M1 flight were dissected and stored in RNA post-flight. The broad parietal section (both the bones) of the calvarial tissue samples were then powdered in a homogenizer and transferred to Eppendorf tubes filled with Trizol®, after which samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and prevented from thawing. Following arrival at the distributed laboratories, samples were thawed and treated in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) for 30 min to completely disassociate the nucleoprotein complex. After 30 min, the samples were pipetted about 20 times and kept at room temperature (RT) for 2 min 200μL of chloroform was added to Trizol® and agitated for 15 s by hand. The samples were kept at RT for another 2 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 70% ethanol. After the total RNA was precipitated, the solution was transferred to an RNA-binding column and RNA purification was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Purelink RNA, Life technologies). The pure RNA was eluted from the columns in 30 μL of RNase-free water, and the RNA concentration and purity was estimated using nanodrop. Normalized RNA (1 mg/ml) was converted into cDNA using a Qiagen kit with a gDNA wipeout buffer. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C for 30 min per manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting cDNA was stored at −20°C or used immediately. The gene expression analysis was carried out using SYBR green (2x QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR, Qiagen) in a 96-well format on an Eppendorf Mastercycler. Primer sequences used for real time PCR are listed in Table 1 and sourced from IDT Technologies. The annealing temperature was standardized at 57°C for 15 s except RUNX2 and OCN for which the annealing temperature was 58°C for 15 s. The results were normalized with 18s RNA and GAPDH housekeeping genes; the experiment was run in triplicates and Livak’s method was used to calculate the difference in expression between SF and GC mice.

All values are mean ± SD and n is the number of animals per group.Results Changes in Vascular Morphology in Mouse Calvaria after 15 and 30 days of Spaceflight Our previous µCT analysis on STS-131 S F calvaria show that 15 days of spaceflight results in a 30% increase in bone volume in spaceflight mice calvaria compared to control mice (Zhang et al., 2013). However, 30 days of spaceflight in BION-M1 did not show remarkable differences in bone volume and thickness (Macaulay et al., 2017). To determine the spaceflight associated vascular effects in mice calvaria, we first qualitatively compared the size of the parietal fenestrae of BION-M1 previously occupied by the vessels from the BION-M1 µCT micrographs (Macaulay et al., 2017). The bone thickness and bone volume of BION-M1 mice calvarial sections are published elsewhere (Macaulay et al., 2017). The scanned µCT micrographs of calvarial sections from GC and SF mice showed decreases in the size of fenestrae around the parietal sutures apart from the appearance of increases in cross-sectional thickness in the representative SF group compared to GC group (Figure 2A, Panels A and B).

The arrows are pointing to the size of the fenestrae (C,D) Eosin hematoxylin staining of the frontal section of the parietal region showing two large venules, arteriole, numerous foci, and cell nucleus within the suture surrounded by loose connective tissue (E,F) Isolectin-IB4 staining of the parietal sections of the mice calvaria; labeling of both large and small vessels is shown with a dotted white line (G–J) Measurements of isolectin-IB4-stained blood vessel diameter and capillary number performed on ≥15–20 microscope images per slide section (n = 2 sections/slide) for a total of eight STS-131 mice exposed to 15 days microgravity (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 4) and 10 BION-M1 mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity (GC, n = 5; SF, n = 5). The values are expressed in mm. The data are represented as mean ± SE, *p = 0.02. The images were obtained with a 4x objective lens and depict fenestrae containing calvarial vessels. Scale bar is 2 mm and the width of the section is 2 mm.Further qualitative histological examination of the bone trabeculae along the suture showed a number of foci, nucleus and empty spaces left by dead cells in the suture region and the bone plates (Figure 2A, Panel C and D). Next, we quantified parasagittal vessel structural and molecular vascular adaptations to 15-day and 30-day spaceflight by immunostaining capillaries in the sagittal suture section of the mice calvaria with, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin isolectin-B4 as a fluorescent endothelial cell marker (Figure 2A, Panels E and F). Manual, double-blinded quantification of Lectin B4-stained parasagittal vessels of the mice calvaria showed a significant increase in vessel numbers in SF mice compared to GC in the STS- 131 mice cohort (GC: 6 ± 2 vessels/mm2, SF: 10 ± 6 vessels/mm2; n = 4, *p = 0.054, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2B). The vessel diameters in bone trabeculae are reduced 4-fold in SF compared to GC in STS-131 tissues (15–20 images, two sections/slide, *p = 0.02) (Figure 2A, Panel C). In BION-M1 mice calvaria, there were no significant differences in the diameter or the number of vessels between GC and SF mice (GC: 20 ± 14 vessels/mm2, SF: 16 ± 8 vessels/mm2; n = 5, *p > 0.05, t-test and Mann-Whitney u-test) (Figure 2C). Capillarization is increased and diameter of the vessel is decreased in the STS-131 S F population while no significant change in the vessel numbers or diameter occurs in BION-M1 SF mice.Microgravity-Associated Alterations in Calvaria Gene Expression Related to Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis To determine the effects of cephalad fluid shifts on calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis associated gene expression, VEGFA, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), BMP-2, dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), RUNX2 and OCN were examined using qPCR in central parietal section of calvaria samples from GC and BION-M1 SF mice. Pro-angiogenic VEGFA expression increases 15 folds in SF compared to GC mice (Figure 3, Panel A). Concomitantly, BMP-2 gene expression increases 11 fold in SF compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel C). RUNX2, required for osteoblast differentiation, also increases 2-fold in SF mice compared to GC (Figure 3, Panel D). DMP1 is involved in the regulation of bone formation and is upregulated in SF mice (Figure 3, Panel F). OCN remained unchanged in GC and SF mice. The material was insufficient to analyze SOST expression, involved in anabolic activity of bone. In sum, both angiogenic and osteogenic genes in the calvaria are upregulated in response to spaceflight-related fluid shifts. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Gene expression analysis related to angiogenesis and osteogenesis in mouse calvaria. Relative mRNA expression levels determined using qPCR analysis of angiogenesis-associated marker genes (VEGFA (A), iNOS (B)) and osteogenesis-associated marker genes (BMP2 (C), RUNX2 (D), DMP1 (E), OCN (F)) in GC and SF mice calvaria. Values are expressed as mean ± SE. Significant differences are indicated by **p < 0.0001 from an unpaired Student’s t-test followed by Mann-Whitney u-test (n = 6 GC and 6 SF animals).Discussion Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure. Unloaded regions of the body such as calvaria show an 30% increase in bone volume when exposed to spaceflight conditions compared to ground controls (Zhang et al., 2013), suggesting differential regulation of load bearing and unloaded regions of the body. Previous work has shown impaired cerebral perfusion and blood distribution based on structural modifications of vessels in the brain due to head-ward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity (Sofronova et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 2013). The mechanosensitivity of bone cells to compressive forces and subsequent increase in bone formation in response to mechanical stimuli is known, calvarial adaptations to cephalad fluid shifts, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebrovascular regulation due to microgravity exposure are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we describe for the first time calvarial vascular morphological alterations in mice exposed to STS-131 conditions, along with angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated calvarial gene expression changes in mice from BION-M1. Consensus is lacking on the exact effects of microgravity on cerebrovascular regulation as the results from different models are inconsistent. Most of the interpretation of the data is based on patterns derived from other pathologies (Du et al., 2021). Consensus points to fluid redistribution and blood pooling in the brain in the absence of hydrostatic gradients as precipitating the neurological and pathological conditions associated with microgravity. Spaceflight reduces bone mineral density in the lower load-bearing musculoskeletal regions compared to non-load bearing regions such as the skull (LeBlanc et al., 2000; Vico et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2013). Mouse skull is a rarely studied structure in spite of its abundance of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as its structural and functional roles during homeostasis and repair. Calvarial thickness and suture growth is age-dependent and progressive (Alberius and Johnell, 1990). The suture section of the calvarial parietal bone consists of the maximum density of the capillaries which support bone development and is therefore suitable for studying vessel morphology and number. The suture in the calvaria is heavily vascularized with small central vessels (Alberius and Johnell, 1990). Lectin binding to the glycoconjugates of endothelial cells plasmalemma allow for a simple method for the visualization of morphology. Therefore, we used lectin stain to label calvarial blood vessels. Blood vessel diameter is up- or downregulated depending on the intensity and direction of blood flow. Correspondingly, our study demonstrated reductions in calvarial blood vessel diameter in STS-131 S F mice as a response to increase in demands for blood flow and bone volume. Our data showed differential profiles for vessel diameters and numbers in the calvarial sections of mice included on STS-131 (15-day) or BION-M1 (30-day). In STS-131 mice, the vessel diameter was reduced and capillarization increased, a trend suggesting calvarial vessel remodeling and capillarization in the bone trabeculae concomitant to increase in calvarial bone mass identified in early study (Zhang et al., 2013). Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal link between expression of angiogenic markers and bone formation (Cackowski et al., 2010; Moser et al., 2018). During injury or stress, resident suture stem cells secrete VEGF and recruit blood vessels to facilitate repair; VEGF stimulates the proliferation of osteoblast and increased VEGF levels are observed at the proliferative stage of bone repair, and this vascularization is essential for tissue recovery and repair. Insufficient or incongruous formation of bone blood vessels leads to irregular bone formation and increased risk of bone fractures (Stegen et al., 2015). The regeneration of vascular supply through vascularization in parallel with osteogenesis is central in the formation of the new functional bone (Amini et al., 2012). Alterations in VEGFA expression correlates with the number of vessels in spaceflight calvaria in the STS-131 flight mice (Figure 2B). Local application of exogenous recombinant BMP2 completely regenerates calvarial defects in a rodent model and is important in tissue healing and restoration. In humans, BMP2 recombinant protein can regenerate mandibular continuity and cleft palate defects (Boyne, 2001; Dickinson et al., 2008; Herford and Boyne, 2008). BMP-2 addition dramatically increases Osteocalcin (OCN) which in turn is responsible for the pro-osteogenesis function of BMP2. BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through RUNX2 expression which directly regulates osteocalcin expression to increase bone formation. RUNX2 is a global regulator of osteogenesis and is crucial for regulating the expression of bone-specific genes. Autocrine BMP production is necessary for the Runx2 transcription factor to be active. Runx2 executes and completes BMP2 signaling for osteoblast differentiation. The co-ordinated activity of Runx2 and BMP2 activated SMADS are critical in bone remodeling and skeleton formation. Taken together, endogenous BMP signaling enhances bone formation and regulation of BMP activity in the postnatal stages is critical for normal bone formation. While acknowledging that there may be site specific and bone dependent differences described by others (Quarto et al., 2010; Kwan et al., 2011; Niziolek et al., 2011), we show that the parietal region of the mice calvaria are sensitive to fluctuations in fluid shifts and results bone vascular responses. Microgravity-mediated cephalad fluid shift results in high intracranial pressure which may affect vessel morphology. Cerebral vasomotor and mechanical properties, deficiencies in femoral muscle regeneration and defective immune response occurs after 30 days of BION-M1 spaceflight (Sofronova et al., 1985; Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014; Markina et al., 2018; Radugina et al., 2018; Tascher et al., 2019). Contrary to this finding, our µCT data of the BION-M1 mice suggests that the calvarial bone structure remain unchanged. However the gene expression of sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation, is higher in the spaceflight group based on our previous results (Macaulay et al., 2017) implying the possibility of both anabolic and catabolic activity of sclerostin. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that loss of sclerostin increases cranial bone growth and regeneration and sclerostin antibodies are used to increase bone mass in clinical trials of osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta (Kang et al., 2018; Scheiber et al., 2019) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in bone formation. One of the mechanisms of bone regeneration is the recruitment of stromal and hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow (Markina et al., 2018). The proliferative capacity of the bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic precursors decreases in the BION-M1 mouse population cohort of mice (Markina et al., 2018) which may explain our findings that the vessel diameter and number of vessels are unchanged in BION-M1 compared to STS-131 (Figure 2). The molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological adaptations of calvarial vessels and bone to cephalad fluid shifts remain poorly understood.Conclusion This work describes microgravity-associated alterations in pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic gene expression in an unloaded bone region in two wild-type study populations. These results suggest skull vasculature and bone as a sensor for gravity and cephalad fluid shifts, outcomes that highlight the importance of the development of countermeasures for long-duration spaceflight. An in-depth, gender-based study of mouse calvaria that includes genomic, proteomic and metabolomic components will further characterize pathways involved in the increase in calvaria growth seen in study populations exposed to microgravity. Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria. The finding is relevant in the development of countermeasures for prolonged crewed spaceflight and to understand the molecular and structural adaptations of bone and vasculature to the microgravity environment. Lastly, there is a need to monitor the entire astronaut skeletal system on a meta-scale and in a spatio-temporal manner; this type of inquiry will leverage the site-specific, heterogenic skeletal responses and the sufficiency of short-term microgravity exposure to induce upregulation of angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression.Limitations The authors recognize several limitations for this study as well as associated opportunities for ongoing study. First, comparisons between study subjects required analysis between genders as well as between varying durations of microgravity and carbon di-oxide exposure. While no evidence of significant skull size differences between the male and females exists, contrasting data from STS-131 females and BION-M1 males will need to be controlled in future work. Second, suture lymphatic vessels were recently identified that may have also accepted lectin stain alongside venules and arterioles. Third, BION-M1 post-flight “recovery” was comprised of 13–15 h needed to transport study subjects from the landing site to the lab for euthanasia. This period of reloading was not controlled for and may have contributed to the gene expression changes seen in the flight animals. Fourth, several whole animals were excluded from data collection due to lack of tissue section integrity on slides. Fifth, we were unable to perform further mechanistic studies using knockout mice due to restricted payload space, prohibitive costs, and other technical challenges. Lastly, due to the limitations in tissue size, we were not able to confirm the protein expression of VEGFA and BMP-2 using immunoblotting. immunostaining, and localization of the proteins using imaging techniques. Future work is planned to examine the microgravity-induced modulation of mouse calvaria at epigenetic, gene, and protein levels. Trends in the heterogeneous skeletal and vascular adaptations dependent on the location and load-bearing properties of the tissue, in addition to angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression, are intriguing. Ongoing study is intended to address the benefit or detriment of this effect.Acknowledgments We acknowledge Ted Kawai and Rajeshwari Pichika for their technical help.Data Availability Statement The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics Statement The animal study was reviewed and approved by Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) as well as the IACUCs of Moscow State University and NASA.Author Contributions JS conceived the study, performed experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Recent studies have demonstrated that the spacecraft environment can be contaminated with numerous microbial species.1 Samples to check for microbes are frequently taken from surfaces, air, and water on the International Space Station (ISS) and tests to identify bacterial species include sequencing of 16s rRNA and culturing viable bacteria.1,2 A variety of bacterial phyla have been identified including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, SR1, Tenericutes, and TM7 and a number of genera have been identified within each phylum.1 The bacteria most frequently found on the ISS include species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Micrococcus.2 Experiments to determine the effect of spaceflight or low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on bacteria have determined that different phenotypes are induced in different types of bacteria. Compared with normal gravity controls alterations to growth, culture density, biofilm formation, aggregation, virulence, and changes in resistance to stress from acid, oxidative stress, heat shock, or antibiotics have been identified.2–10 It is not possible to generalize or predict how a bacterial species will react to microgravity or LSMMG. An example is resistance to oxidative stress: exposure to LSMMG increased oxidative stress resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa11 but decreased oxidative stress resistance of Staphylococcus aureus.12 Changes in the bacterial transcriptome11–14 are also induced by microgravity and LSMMG, and changes to the bacterial phenotype are likely due to alterations in the bacterial transcriptome. The diverse phenotypes induced by spaceflight or LSMMG2–7 highlights the need to understand more about how different species of bacteria are altered by microgravity and the importance of identifying key molecules that promote survival under the stress of microgravity. Mycobacterium marinum is a member of a family of closely related mycobacteria, most of which are pathogenic. They include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium ulcerans.15 Although M. tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, live and replicate only in a host in nature,15,16 M. marinum and M. avium grow in macrophage and aquatic environments.16 M. marinum grows at 28–35 °C and infects poikilothermic hosts such as fish and frogs, but can infect humans resulting in granulomatous skin lesions, which pathologically are identical to lesions produced by dermal M. tuberculosis. The pathogenic M. avium complex, which includes the subspecies avium, paratuberculosis, and intracellulare, has been linked with hard-to-treat non-tuberculosis human pulmonary infections in non-immunocompromised17 as well as immunocompromised individuals.18 M. marinum19 and M. avium form biofilms and can grow in biofilms in water distribution systems,20 taps, and showerheads. Thirty percent of biofilms tested from showerheads across the USA contained M. avium even though they were linked to municipal water supplies treated with chlorine.21 M. avium grown in a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine, even when the biofilm is disrupted.22 Pathogenic waterborne mycobacteria could pose a potential threat during space travel not only to astronaut health, but also to the spacecraft environment and potable water. In fact, M. avium was identified in water samples taken from the Russian Mir space station.23 Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to have increased antimicrobial resistance and virulence are a concern inside spacecraft because astronauts already have a compromised immune system, especially when in space for long periods of time.24,25 Uncovering the signaling pathways that result in the altered physiology of bacteria has the potential to reveal new targets for drug development or disinfection that will be essential for long space flights. There are no published studies on the effect of microgravity or LSMMG on waterborne mycobacteria. Hfq has been identified as a factor regulating microgravity gene expression in P. aeruginosa,13 S. aureus,12 and Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium14 (S. typhimurium), but mycobacteria do not encode Hfq.26 M. marinum is closely related genetically to M. tuberculosis and M. avium and has similar mechanisms of infection and survival inside host macrophage. Although all of these mycobacterium species can grow in specialized medium in the laboratory,27 growth of M. marinum even at the lower temperature of 30–32 °C is faster than M. tuberculosis27 and M. avium.28 M. marinum is also a lower risk (bisoafety level 2) to researchers. Hence M. marinum is a good model for pathogenic mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the adaptation of M. marinum to the LSMMG stressful environment and determine how LSMMG alters mycobacterium physiology. Two strains of M. marinum (1218R and LHM4) were used for this study. Strain 1218R was originally isolated from fish and LHM4 was generated from 1218R by integrating a plasmid into the genome that encodes for kanamycin resistance and the red fluorescent protein. Previous work studying the effect of LSMMG on bacteria with doubling times of <1 h exposed the bacteria to LSMMG for 10,29 20,30 24 h11 or 10 generations.31 M. marinum has a doubling time of 6–7 h at 30 °C and hence two exposure times to LSMMG or NG (short ~40 h and long 4 days and ~35 h) were selected to allow the bacteria to undergo multiple replication cycles during the experiments. The exposure protocol was designed so that short and long LSMMG- or NG-exposed cultures were in exponential phase and hence alterations to the transcriptome or resistance to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acid or gamma radiation were due to different exposure times to LSMMG and not due to different phases of growth. In summary, this work characterizes the growth, stress survival, and transcriptome of M. marinum grown under LSMMG and identifies nutrient deprivation as a signal involved in changes to gene expression and the sigma factor SigH as a factor modulating the LSMMG transcriptome in a waterborne mycobacterium.",

    "results": "Results The effect of LSMMG exposure time had to be assessed with bacteria in the same phase of growth, as we found stress resistance altered as the M. marinum progressed from early to late exponential phase (data not shown) and it would be expected that the transcriptome of replicating bacteria is very different from bacteria in stationary phase. For the short exposure, M. marinum were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.002 at the initiation of the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) culture to make sure that the bacteria would be in exponential phase (OD600~0.1–0.2) after ~40 h. This exposure time allowed ~6 generations. For the longer exposure time, M. marinum were subjected to 4 days of growth under LSMMG or NG, the bacteria removed from the HARV, re-diluted in fresh medium and the LSMMG or NG exposure continued in new HARVs for a further ~35 h (see Materials and Methods for full details). LSMMG did not alter aggregation of M. marinum Previous published studies observed increased aggregation of bacteria exposed to microgravity or LSMMG.4,12,14 Mycobacterium under normal laboratory conditions grow as aggregates and standard culture procedure27,32 uses Tween 80 in the medium to minimize clumping. Even in the presence of 0.2% Tween 80, M. marinum still aggregate. Cultures exposed to NG or LSMMG for various times were examined by microscopy to determine whether exposure to LSMMG altered aggregation. Similar size aggregates were detected in both LSMMG and NG cultures (Supplementary Figure 1A), so growth under LSMMG and standard culture medium did not increase clumping of M. marinum. To determine whether the Tween 80 in the culture medium prevented the detection of structure alterations under LSMMG, 1218R and LHM4 were grown initially in a tube with 0.2% Tween 80 until OD600 ~1 in the rotating incubator as described in the Materials and Methods section. The cultures were then diluted to OD600 0.002 in growth medium without Tween 80. One dilution for each strain was used to prepare two 50 ml HARVs and a tube culture. The cultures in the tube and HARVs were grown for 67 h (LHM4) or 69 h (1218R). The tube was incubated in the rotating incubator at 120 r.p.m. and the HARVs were grown under NG or LSMMG. The culture in the tube grew as small clumps (data not shown) and clumps were also visible in the HARV cultures. When the culture was removed from the HARVs it was not possible to determine the optical density of the culture as bacteria had adhered to the base of the HARV grown under NG, preventing an accurate measurement. Samples of each culture were examined by microscopy (Supplementary Figure 1B and C) and cording of the mycobacterium was seen in all cultures. This cording structure is known to form in broth as well as biofilms.19,33 Under the conditions examined, there was no obvious difference between the NG and LSMMG cultures. Further studies are required to determine whether there are subtle structure differences between the cords or whether cord formation is accelerated under LSMMG. As growth in the absence of Tween 80 prevents accurate measurements of culture density and total recovery of the culture from the HARVs, all further studies were performed in the presence of 0.2% Tween 80. M. marinum grown under LSMMG transition from exponential phase earlier than NG-exposed M. marinum Thirteen independent cultures of LHM4 and three independent cultures of 1218R were grown continuously for 4 days in 10 ml HARVs under LSMMG or NG and significantly different OD600 were obtained for LSMMG compared with NG cultures (Figure 1a). The OD600 of the LSMMG culture was reduced by at least 50% compared with the NG culture. To determine in more detail how growth was altered by LSMMG, growth studies of LHM4 (Figure 1b) and 1218R (Figure 1c) were performed over a period of 150 h where the OD600 was monitored by removal of a sample of the culture at the different time points. Experiments were performed in triplicate and all data points from these experiments were pooled and plotted to examine the effect of LSMMG on growth (Figure 1b and c). The LSMMG cultures of LHM4 and 1218R had slightly lower OD600 compared with the NG culture at ~37 h after culture initiation and this difference increased with time (Figure 1e and f). This was very consistent and detected in all experiments with both M. marinum strains. A similar result was found when LHM4 colony forming units per ml (CFU/ ml) was plotted against time (Supplementary Figure 2). As the OD600 measurements for the NG cultures began to plateau at around 90 h, indicating an exit from logarithmic growth, the data between 37 and 70 h were considered (Figure 1e and f). Regression analyses determined that during this time period that the data were significantly different (P<0.0001) for the LSMMG and NG cultures of LHM4 and 1218R. To examine the extent of change on growth during this transition from exponential phase, the doubling times during this time period were calculated from Figure 1e and f: doubling times were 10 h (LHM4) and 11 h (1218R) for NG cultures, and 15.5 h (LHM4) and 16 h (1218R) for LSMMG cultures. The LSMMG culture did eventually reach a similar culture density to the NG culture at later time points (Figure 1b). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Growth under LSMMG alters culture density of M. marinum. LHM4 and 1218R was grown in 10 ml HARVs under NG or LSMMG for 4 days continuously and the OD600 determined. The data from 13 HARVs for LHM4 and 3 HARVs for 1218R for each condition was used to obtain the average and s.d. (a). OD600 was monitored for LHM4 (b) and 1218R (c) in 50 ml HARVs. At each time point, a small culture volume (1–2 ml) was removed to measure OD600 and the volume replaced with fresh medium (2–4% total volume). Strain 1218R was also grown in medium with catalase (d). Three independent experiments were performed for each strain and growth condition. As data were not gathered at the exact time point in each experiment, all the data points were pooled for a strain and condition and are shown graphically (b–d). A transition from exponential phase was detected at ~37 h in LSMMG cultures compared with NG cultures. The data between 37 and 70 h for the three experiments were plotted (e, f) and regression analysis performed, demonstrating that the increase in OD600 during this time period was statistically different when the bacteria were grown under NG and LSMMG (P<0.0001).As OD600 can be influenced by size of the bacteria, the diameter and length of 50 bacteria in an LHM4 culture grown for 4 days under LSMMG (OD600=1.3) or NG (OD600=2.3) were determined. No statistical significant difference was found for the diameter (NG=0.72±0.05 μm, LSMMG=0.73±0.07 μm) or the length (NG=2.7±0.45 μm, LSMMG=2.7±0.5 μm) between the two cultures. Published studies have determined that LSMMG induces oxidative stress genes in bacteria;30 suggesting LSMMG disturbs the normal redox environment. Catalase breaks down H2O2 and is present in standard M. tuberculosis medium (3 μg/ml). Growth experiments for 1218R were therefore performed with medium containing catalase (3 μg/ml) to remove extracellular H2O2. No change in growth was detected when the medium contained catalase, which suggests extracellular H2O2 did not hinder growth under LSMMG (Figure 1d). M. marinum transcriptome response to LSMMG RNA samples isolated from triplicate independent cultures of 1218R grown under LSMMG or NG cultures for the short or long exposure times were used for RNA-Seq analyses, and 6–10 million reads were sequenced for each biological sample (Supplementary Table 1). RNA-Seq using 5–10 million non-rRNA reads has previously been found to provide sufficient depth of sequencing to detect the majority of alterations in bacterial gene expression.34 Following transcript quantification a comparison of LSMMG with NG after short or long exposure times (Supplementary Excel Worksheets 1 and 2) identified 562 and 328 genes, respectively, with significantly altered transcript levels. From the 10 categories of mycobacterial genes (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/marinolist.html), the intermediary metabolism and respiration category had the greatest number of genes with significant transcript changes (Supplementary Table 2). To determine the genes with the greatest physiological relevance to growth under LSMMG the real fold change (RFC) was calculated (Supplementary Excel Worksheets). Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was also performed for 9 different genes and the majority of the LSMMG/NG fold changes in expression determined by RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR were similar (Supplementary Table 3). The genes with the greatest RNA-Seq RFC (top 10%) after short and long exposure times are shown in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5. Genes that changed expression ⩾1.5-fold (RFC⩽0.67 or ⩾1.5) by RNA-Seq were identified and the log10 RFC plotted for the genes according to category (Figure 2). The category with the greatest number of genes for LSMMG versus NG at each exposure time (Figure 2a and b) was intermediary metabolism, and there was an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression. The categories of genes relating to the cell wall and the conserved hypotheticals had the next highest number of genes that significantly changed. Even though these categories also had an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression (Figure 2a and b), some genes relating to these two categories had the highest RFC, especially after a short exposure to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Unfortunately the function of the conserved hypothetical genes is unknown. The majority of genes involved in the information pathway and lipid metabolism categories decreased expression, whereas the genes in the PE/PPE and virulence categories increased expression (Figure 2a and b). There were also genes in the regulatory protein category that were significantly changed by LSMMG, but genes were again evenly distributed for increased and decreased expression. When the data from the LSMMG samples for short versus long exposure times were statistically compared, it was evident that gene expression continued to change with greater exposure to LSMMG (Figure 2c), and the categories for cell wall, intermediary metabolism, PE/PPE, and virulence increased expression. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gene expression changes identified by RNA-Seq. Transcriptional profiles were compared between 1218R grown at LSMMG and NG for 40 h (a, LSMMG/NG) or 4 days ~35 h (b, LSMMG/NG) and between 1218R grown under LSMMG for the two time periods (c, 4 days ~35 h/40 h). The significant (P<0.05) changes in transcript levels were identified. The real fold change (RFC) is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG divided by the normalized mean count values for NG. The genes that changed ⩾1.5-fold were assigned to categories (1–9) and the distribution of the RFC is shown graphically. No genes were significantly altered ⩾1.5-fold in the insertion sequences and phage category and so this category is not included. The mean value for the RFC for a category is marked by the black spot and the number of genes in the category is shown in parentheses.To identify genes involved in adaptation to LSMMG, genes were considered that significantly changed ⩾1.5-fold at both the short and long exposure time points (Table 1). The changes for the majority of these 97 genes were very similar at the two time points. Transcript changes include a ~2-fold decrease for ribosomal proteins and a decrease for most of the genes in categories related to lipid metabolism and intermediary metabolism (Table 1). The greatest changes were in genes encoding chaperone proteins. Table 1. M. marinum genes that significantly altered expression when grown under LSMMG for both 40 h, and 4 days ~35 h (LSMMG/NG).

RFC is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG over the normalized mean count values for NG. Expression of cell metabolism genes Groups of genes linked with specific metabolic pathways were examined using hierarchical clustering in GeneSifter to determine whether gene expression changes were linked to growth under LSMMG. Hierarchical clustering of all the LSMMG samples suggests changes in gene expression were linked to LSMMG. Genes involved in glycolysis (12 genes), electron transport chain (ETC, 87 genes), pentose phosphate pathway (7 genes), gluconeogenesis (15 genes), methylcitrate cycle (10 genes), glyoxylate cycle (14 genes), and citric acid cycle (TCA, 19 genes) were examined. The majority of these pathways had few significant changes or changes not related to LSMMG (data not shown). An example is ETC, where 22 genes had significant alterations but the changes were not linked to growth under LSMMG (Supplementary Figure 3A). However, 17/19 TCA genes had altered expression linked to LSMMG (Supplementary Figure 3B). Transcript levels for aconitase decreased after short exposure to LSMMG. Succinate dehydrogenase is also a TCA enzyme, but also forms complex II of the ETC.35,36 There are two forms of succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh1 and Sdh2) and transcript levels of 3 (sdhB-D) of the four genes encoding Sdh2 decreased at the short exposure time point, while transcripts from sdhB and sdhD decreased after long exposure. There was no change in expression of the genes encoding Sdh1. Proline oxidation can also donate electrons to ETC.36 Transcripts from MMAR_4252 (putA, proline dehydrogenase) and MMAR_4253 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase) were increased 2–4-fold by LSMMG after the short exposure time (Supplementary Worksheets 1 and 2). After the long exposure time, only MMAR_4252 was increased 2.6-fold (Table 1). Isocitrate lyase (Icl) is an enzyme that connects the TCA and glyoxylate cycle and transcript levels from icl (MMAR_0792) decreased by ~10-fold in LSMMG bacteria after the long exposure time (Supplementary Table 5). Transcription of genes involved in lipid degradation and catabolism of fatty acids were altered significantly in LSMMG bacteria. We identified 104 genes in M. marinum involved in lipid degradation and 53 had ⩾1.5-fold significant change in transcript levels after growth under LSMMG (Figure 3a). Of the 53 genes, 16 had decreased expression and 37 had increased expression, the majority of which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid β oxidation. Fatty acids are also used for polyketide lipid synthesis of phenolic glycolipids and phthiocerol dimycocerosates, mycolic acid (MA) synthesis, production of cell membrane phospholipids, as well as production of carbon stores in the form of triacylglycerol.37 Although there were no alterations in expression of genes encoding triacylglycerol synthase (MMAR_2634, MMAR_2598, MMAR_1519 and MMAR_1157), genes involved in polyketide lipid synthesis (fadD22 and pks15/1) were decreased 1.5- to 2-fold (Supplementary Excel Worksheets 1 and 2) and multiple genes38 encoding proteins involved in MA synthesis were also decreased (Table 1 and Figure 3b). Two genes (desA3 and desA3_2) encoding membrane-bound desaturases showed increased expression at both time points in LSMMG bacteria (Table 1 and Figure 3b). These desaturases are involved in oleic acid production and potentially the production of cis double bonds in meromycolic acids.38 Figure 3. Open in a new tab Growth under LSMMG increases expression of genes involved in lipid degradation and mycobactin synthesis but decreases expression of genes involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Genes involved in the designated categories lipid degradation (a), mycolic acid synthesis (b) and mycobactin synthesis (c) were identified using the mycobrowser website (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) and the literature.38 The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed using Genesifter. Only genes with ⩾1.5-fold change in expression (P<0.05) were considered. The data were log transformed. The heat maps were generated showing expression in short (growth for ~40 h) and long (growth for 4 days ~35 h) exposure samples. Genes colored brown are discussed in the manuscript text.Mycobactins chelate iron from the environment and are also known to be important for mycobacterial growth during infection of macrophage.39 Sixteen genes involved in mycobactin synthesis were identified and six increased expression after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and ~35 h (Figure 3c). SigH: a possible regulator of the mycobacteria LSMMG response sigH transcript levels increased 1.5-fold at both time points (Table 1). SigH is known to regulate chaperone encoding genes40,41 (hsp and the dnaK, dnaJ, grpE and hspR operon) and hsp transcript levels increased at both time points (Table 1). Transcripts from all the dnaK operon genes increased after ~40 h of LSMMG exposure (Supplementary Table 4 and Excel Worksheet 1), while only transcripts from dnaK and hspR increased after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and ~35 h (Supplementary Table 5 and Excel Worksheet 2). M. tuberculosis SigH directly/indirectly regulated genes have been identified in a study41 where wild-type and sigH mutant M. tuberculosis were allowed to recover after diamide treatment: RNA analysis identified 44 genes at 0 min and 91 genes at 30 min of recovery as SigH-regulated genes. We identified the M. marinum orthologs of these genes (40 at 0 min and 78 at 30 min) and using GeneSifter determined that >50% of these orthologs altered expression significantly after growth under LSMMG (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Changes in expression of SigH-regulated genes show a linkage to growth under LSMMG. Mehr et al.41 treated wild-type and sigH mutant M. tuberculosis with diamide and determined SigH-related gene expression changes after 0 and 30 min recovery time. Peak sigH transcript was at 30 min. M. marinum orthlogs of these genes were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA. The data were log transformed. The heat maps show expression changes during LSMMG and NG for the orthologs of the M. tuberculosis genes that changed after 0 (a) and 30 min (b). Genes colored brown are discussed in the text. Changes in expression of genes related to the enduring hypoxic response and the nutrient starvation response The enduring hypoxic response (EHR)42 and the relA nutrient starvation response43 are well characterized in M. tuberculosis. We identified 147 M. marinum orthologs from the 230 M. tuberculosis genes involved in EHR, and 105 M. marinum orthologs from the 147 M. tuberculosis genes involved in the nutrient starvation response. These orthologs (58 for EHR and 46 for nutrient starvation response) were also found to significantly alter expression⩾1.5-fold due to LSMMG (Figure 5). The EHR genes that overlap with the LSMMG changes in M. marinum (Figure 5a) include sigH and SigH-regulated genes. For M. tuberculosis, all the genes in Figure 5a increase expression during EHR, whereas 25 increased transcript levels under LSMMG. A major group of overlapping genes between the nutrient starvation response in M. tuberculosis and the LSMMG response in M. marinum are related to translation. The nutrient starvation response includes 23 translation-related genes and 22 decrease expression during the response. There are 21 corresponding M. marinum orthologs, 17 changed expression in M. marinum under LSMMG and 16 decreased expression (Figure 5b and Table 1). Figure 5. Open in a new tab The effect of LSMMG on genes involved in the enduring hypoxic response (EHR) or nutrient starvation response. Genes involved in these two stress responses have been identified in M. tuberculosis.42,43 The M. marinum orthologs were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) for the EHR (a) and relA nutrient starvation (b) response43 (Supplemental Data Set 1 and section 3 in ref. 43). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA analysis. The data were log transformed. Genes colored brown are discussed in the text. Comparison of M. marinum exposed to LSMMG and P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight or LSMMG During spaceflight, 167 genes were differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa and Hfq was identified as a transcription regulator of the bacterial response to microgravity13 and LSMMG.11 Mycobacteria do not have a gene encoding Hfq, but there is overlap in the lists of genes that are differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight or LSMMG and M. marinum subjected to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). A hypergeometric distribution test was performed to determine whether the number of genes found to overlap were significant or could have occurred by chance. The number of protein coding sequences in M. marinum is 5,452 (refs 15,44) and from the short exposure to LSMMG there were 562 significant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight (where 167 changes were detected) and 47 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG (where 330 changes were detected). From the long exposure of M. marinum to LSMMG, there were 328 significant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight and 34 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG. The number of overlapping genes in each case was found to be significant (short exposure M. marinum and spaceflight P. aeruginosa representation factor 2.2, P<1.513e−6, short exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representation factor 1.4, P<0.012, long exposure M. marinum and spaceflight P. aeruginosa representation factor 3.8, P<2.17e−13, long exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representation factor 1.7, P<0.001). When comparing the LSMMG M. marinum data with the spaceflight data from P. aeruginosa, the largest overlap in downregulated genes encode ribosomal proteins and other common downregulated genes produce proteins involved in transcription and translation. Genes encoding the metabolic enzymes Icl and Sdh2 are also downregulated in both organisms, suggesting similar downregulation of metabolic pathways. Interestingly there were no genes with decreased transcript levels detected for P. aeruginosa grown under LSMMG, but 330 transcript levels increased by ⩾1.5-fold.11 From this list a number of transcripts encoding proteins of similar function were increased in P. aeruginosa subjected to LSMMG but decreased in LSMMG-grown M. marinum (Supplementary Table 7). These include transcripts for 13 ribosomal proteins, Sdh2 (sdhB and sdhD), Icl, RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA) and elongation factor Ts (tsf). A common group of genes with increased transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum and P. aeruginosa were the stress response genes for heat shock and chaperone proteins. Transcriptome data therefore suggest that M. marinum grown under LSMMG exhibit similar stress responses as LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa, but have transcriptional, translational, and metabolic alterations similar to spaceflight-exposed P. aeruginosa. Survival of LHM4 NG- and LSMMG-exposed cultures to stressful conditions Ionizing radiation and H2O2 produce an oxidizing environment in cells. Compared with NG, LSMMG-exposed bacteria showed no change in resistance to ionizing radiation (Figure 6a), but were more sensitive to H2O2 (Figure 6b) with the sensitivity increasing with longer exposure to LSMMG. LHM4 exposed to NG and LSMMG for 4 days and ~35 h were also tested for sensitivity to pH 3.5 for up to 4 h and no cell death occurred (Figure 6c). Figure 6. Open in a new tab LHM4 grown under LSMMG are more sensitive to H2O2 but not gamma radiation or acid in comparison with NG cultures. Bacteria were grown in HARVs under LSMMG or NG for ~40 h (short exposure time) or 4 days ~35 h (long exposure time). Cultures were removed and treated with gamma radiation using a 137Cesium source (a), H2O2 (b), or growth medium at pH 3.5 (c). Bacteria were grown on solid medium and colonies counted. The percent survival was calculated by dividing the colony number/ml by that obtained for a culture treated with no dose at the same time. At least three experiments were performed for each culture and treatment type, except for the short exposure time LSMMG and NG cultures treated with H2O2 where two experiments were performed. The average and s.d. are shown. Survival was compared between the LSMMG and NG samples using the area under the curve and the only statistically significant difference was between the long exposure LSMMG culture and the long exposure NG culture treated with H2O2 (*P=0.004).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Previous studies examining liquid bacterial growth during space travel3 or LSMMG2,3 have found species-specific alterations: LSMMG-grown S. typhimurium had decreased doubling time in minimal medium,29 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis reached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during spaceflight compared with ground controls,45 while S. aureus achieved higher cell densities in the normal gravity control compared with the LSMMG culture.12 In our study, in a 4-day continuous growth culture, M. marinum subjected to NG achieved a higher cell density than the LSMMG culture. As the size of the bacteria did not change and aggregates were disrupted before optical density measurements were determined, the lower LSMMG cell density was likely due to an alteration in growth. A more detailed examination of the growth indicated an early transition of the LSMMG bacteria from exponential phase resulting in a slowing of growth. Even though RNA-Seq analysis was performed at the point where this transition was just detectable, the slowing of growth is apparent from changes in the transcriptome. MA synthesis is linked to new membrane synthesis and cell wall expansion38 and is needed for bacterial cell division, and MA synthesis gene transcript levels decreased ~3-fold under LSMMG. During exponential growth there is also a linear relationship between bacterial growth rate and the number of ribosomes in a cell.46 The slower growing LSMMG M. marinum culture had ~2-fold reduction in transcripts of multiple ribosomal proteins, indicating a downregulation of translation. P. aeruginosa13 and S. typhimurium14 cultured during spaceflight also had decreased ribosomal protein transcripts, but growth studies were not performed for these bacteria. Transcriptome changes imply a nutrient-deprived environment under LSMMG Forty-six M. marinum orthologs of the M. tuberculosis relA nutrient starvation response genes43 had expression changes linked to LSMMG. Nutrient starvation results in decreased growth rate, translation, lipid biosynthesis (e.g., MA synthesis), and downregulation of metabolism.43,47 These phenotypes were also implied from the transcriptome data for LSMMG-exposed M. marinum. Key bacterial metabolic pathways include β-oxidation of fatty acids, ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles.35 In LSMMG M. marinum, a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid degradation increased expression, but icl transcript levels decreased ~10-fold after long exposure to LSMMG. Icl converts isocitrate into glyoxylate, and glyoxylate combined with acetyl CoA from β oxidation of fatty acids produces malate for the glyoxylate cycle.35 Also transcript levels decreased 3–6-fold in LSMMG M. marinum for the WhiB3 transcription regulator, which is implicated in the adaptation of mycobacteria to growth on long-chain fatty acids.48 The transcriptome data therefore suggest energy generation from fatty acids was depressed in LSMMG M. marinum. Decreased transcript levels of genes encoding Sdh2 and aconitase suggest that ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles are depressed in LSMMG M. marinum. Sdh2 is an enzyme that is essential for growth and Sdh1 cannot substitute for all activities of Sdh2 (ref. 49), which links oxidative phosphorylation energy production to carbon metabolism.36 Succinate oxidation generates electrons for ETC, but in mycobacteria proline oxidation can substitute for succinate oxidation under carbon starvation and slow growth conditions.36 The transcriptome data indicate that M. marinum increased proline oxidation under LSMMG; transcript levels increased for proline oxidation enzymes when transcript levels from the Sdh2 genes decreased. Sdh1 and 2 levels in Mycobacterium smegmatis have been linked to energy availability and oxygen levels: under energy-limiting conditions Sdh2 is downregulated and Sdh1 is upregulated, and this is reversed under oxygen-limiting conditions.36 Even though in our study, the genes encoding Sdh1 did not alter expression significantly, the transcript changes for Sdh2 and the proline oxidation enzymes suggest that LSMMG M. marinum could still produce energy by ETC, and were sensing a carbon-starved/energy-limiting environment. Taken together, the slower growth and the transcriptome data relating to translation and metabolism suggest that LSMMG simulates nutrient deprivation conditions in M. marinum. Fluid dynamics in cultures under microgravity or LSMMG are different from NG cultures.8,11 Crabbé et al.11 examined fluid mixing in HARVs subjected to NG and LSMMG by adding a drop of crystal violet to the fluid-filled vessels. This experiment demonstrated different mixing rates under the two conditions: even after 12 h the crystal violet had dispersed only around the circumference of the HARV subjected to LSMMG, while complete dispersal had occurred under NG. This decreased mixing and low fluid shear under LSMMG and the fact that M. marinum are non-motile in liquid culture results in the environment immediately around the bacterium being influenced more by diffusion. Under LSMMG, diffusion is likely the main method moving nutrients to and waste products away from the bacterium. The fluid dynamics in the LSMMG culture could therefore generate a local nutrient-deprived condition. This idea is also supported by increased transcript levels of the WhiB7 transcription regulator and the mycobactin synthesis genes after long exposure to LSMMG. whiB7 is induced by nutrient starvation and growth under low-iron conditions,50,51 while mycobactin synthesis genes are induced under iron-restricted conditions.52 This is very relevant to cultures in potable water during spaceflight, which is where waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria could be found. In fact, M. avium 16s rRNA was identified by PCR amplification in three different water condensation samples from the Mir space station.23 Stress response genes Even though there were LSMMG-linked transcript alterations related to M. tuberculosis EHR, the metabolic transcriptome data does not suggest the LSMMG M. marinum were under hypoxia. Many of the EHR genes that changed were stress response genes and included sigH, chaperone and heat-shock-regulated genes. SigH is one of 18 sigma factors in M. marinum53 and sigma factors function in promoter sequence recognition; directing initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase.54 sigH was the only sigma factor gene to increase expression under LSMMG at both the short and long exposure times. Transcript levels of genes regulated directly or indirectly by SigH also changed significantly due to LSMMG exposure. SigH autoregulates its expression by binding to its own promoter and increasing transcription, and SigH is post-translationally regulated by RshA and PknB. RshA binds to SigH and prevents SigH from binding to RNA polymerase and SigH-RshA binding is disrupted by heat or redox stress,55 as well as phosphorylation by PknB.56 Small/no changes were detected in rshA and pknB transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum, but conditions inside the LSMMG mycobacteria could have induced a substantial activity change in SigH by disrupting binding to RshA. A 1.5-fold increase in the sigH transcript is implicated in the 40-fold increase in hsp transcript after long exposure to LSMMG. SigH is also required for the induction of sigB and sigE,54 and transcript levels from these genes increased after exposure to LSMMG for 4 days and ~35 h albeit by a small amount (Figure 4). SigE has been implicated in the repression of icl,57 so increased SigE expression after the long exposure time to LSMMG may explain the decrease in the icl transcript. SigH is known to be involved in the response of mycobacteria to oxidative stress as well as heat shock. Therefore M. marinum exposed to LSMMG would be expected to be resistant to H2O2. AlgU is another alternate sigma factor involved in heat shock and oxidative stress that has been implicated in the LSMMG response of P. aeruginosa11 and LSMMG-exposed P. aeruginosa were more resistant to H2O2 treatment.11 However, LSMMG-exposed LHM4 were more sensitive to H2O2 in our study. LHM4 was derived from 1218R by integration of an RFP-expressing plasmid (pDEAM2) at the attB site in the genome. The attB site is used to integrate plasmids into mycobacterium, as integration does not disrupt any genes.58 Previous studies have demonstrated that a M. marinum strain similar to LHM4 that was derived by pDEAM2 integration into 1218R had similar growth characteristics and virulence in Medaka fish to 1218R.59 We also determined that LHM4 and 1218R had similar growth characteristics under LSMMG. Therefore, LSMMG-exposed 1218R would be expected to be sensitive to H2O2. Interestingly, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii grown under LSMMG have also been found to be more sensitive to H2O2 than NG controls.12,60 A second group using S. typhimurium did find that LSMMG induced resistance to H2O2 and that resistance involved induction of catalase.30 Sensitivity to H2O2 could be altered by the availability of detoxification enzymes (catalase and alkyl hydroperoxidases), proteins involved in ‘repairing’ oxidized proteins (thioredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases) or redox buffers such as mycothiol and ergothioneine.51 Transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins or the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mycothiol and ergothioneine did not significantly decrease in LSMMG M. marinum, which suggests these protection mechanisms were not compromised compared with the NG control. In fact, transcriptome data indicate that the trxB1 transcript, which encodes one of the thioredoxins, increased by 4-fold after the long exposure time. Cysteine, which is key to many of the protecting enzymes/compounds, was also being conserved and production increased: the transcript of cysteine desulfurase decreased by 2-fold after LSMMG exposure and the cysK2 transcript increased ~4-fold after the long exposure to LSMMG. Even though LSMMG M. marinum were more sensitive to H2O2, they had no change in sensitivity to killing by ionizing radiation compared with the NG control. Ionizing radiation and H2O2 are similar in that they both induce oxidative stress and generate similar types of DNA damage61 and DNA is a critical target in cells for cell killing. Lack of enhanced killing by radiation suggests the increased sensitivity to H2O2 was due to a different mechanism of radical formation/ cell killing by H2O2 in LSMMG bacteria that could not be defended against by the SigH response. In mycobacteria, the outer cell wall is the first line of defense against H2O2. This is not the case for ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy in the molecules of the cell and generates DNA damage by depositing energy directly on the DNA or by depositing energy in water, which produces hydroxyl radicals that then induce DNA damage.62 The energy deposited by the radiation can also generate lipid peroxides and oxidation of protein molecules, but the delivery of the energy to the macromolecules is not impeded by the structures surrounding or within the bacterium. Therefore, ionizing radiation energy deposition and DNA damage production will occur even if the cell wall composition changes. H2O2 can pass through lipid bilayers but is broken down to hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction, which requires Fe2+ (ref. 63). The hydroxyl radicals can generate lipid peroxides from reaction with lipids in the cell wall that can diffuse and generate DNA damage.64 The composition of the cell wall and the iron content of the cell could therefore modify radical formation and alter the sensitivity of the cell to H2O2. There were a substantial number of transcript changes in LSMMG M. marinum related to the cell wall. Transcripts of genes related to MA and phenolic glycolipid synthesis were decreased, while transcripts encoding proteins involved in modifying the types of MA were increased. LSMMG-exposed M. marinum also had an increase in transcripts related to mycobactin synthesis and mycobactins bind iron from the environment and transport the charged iron across the hydrophobic cell wall.39 An increase in mycobactin synthesis could therefore increase iron content in the mycobacterium. Alterations to mycobactin synthesis and to the composition of the mycobacterium cell wall could therefore explain why the LSMMG-exposed mycobacterium, even with the sigH operon response, were more sensitive to H2O2 but not ionizing radiation. The changes at the cell wall did not sensitize the LSMMG M. marinum to pH 3.5 and so cell wall lipid composition may not influence acid resistance. Other bacteria exposed to LSMMG have also been found not to have increased sensitivity to killing by acid60 even though they were more sensitive to H2O2. Recently, M. tuberculosis acid resistance was linked to asparagine metabolism.65 An asparagine transporter AnsP2 imports asparagine into the bacterium where asparaginase AnsA breaks down asparagine to aspartate with the production of ammonia. The ammonia buffers hydrogen ions by forming NH4+. AnsA is also secreted to perform this reaction in the environment around the mycobacterium. In M. marinum, AnsP2 is encoded by MMAR_0627 and AnsA is encoded by MMAR_2360. Transcript levels of these genes did not alter during exposure to LSMMG and hence the ability to produce ammonia may not have changed in LSMMG-exposed M. marinum. This may explain why LSMMG-exposed M. marinum were not more sensitive to killing by acid. Could LSMMG alter the virulence of M. marinum? sigB, E and H as well as hsp and dnaK are induced when M. marinum infect fish or are ingested by mosquito larvae,53 and M. marinum ingested by mosquito larvae are more virulent in fish compared with in vitro cultured M. marinum.59 Exposure to the mosquito larvae gut therefore primes the M. marinum for survival inside fish macrophage. The hsp gene is also the most induced M. tuberculosis gene during macrophage infection,52 and sigH mutants of M. tuberculosis and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis have reduced survival in animal infection models.66,67 Induction of the SigH stress response by LSMMG before infection should aid survival of mycobacteria in macrophage and potentially increase virulence. The transcriptome of LSMMG M. marinum is also similar to mycobacteria inside macrophage in that they have altered growth and metabolism to survive under a nutrient- and iron-starved environment.39,43,52 LSMMG increased transcripts involved in lipid degradation and mycobacteria inside macrophage use host lipids for a source of energy.37 However, Icl expression would need to increase; studies have shown that Icl is essential to connect lipid degradation with the glyoxylate shunt, and is required for survival in animals.35 Even though LSMMG M. marinum do have a number of adaptations that would prime them for increased virulence, the enhanced killing by H2O2 is likely to be detrimental for bacterial survival inside macrophage. Future studies examining LSMMG- or spaceflight-exposed M. marinum survival inside macrophage and fish are needed to determine whether M. marinum in space could pose a risk to the health of astronauts. As M. marinum is an accepted model of waterborne mycobacteria and M. tuberculosis, these results do have implications for other pathogenic mycobacteria exposed to LSMMG as they may respond with similar transcriptome changes.",

Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response.Introduction Recent studies have demonstrated that the spacecraft environment can be contaminated with numerous microbial species.1 Samples to check for microbes are frequently taken from surfaces, air, and water on the International Space Station (ISS) and tests to identify bacterial species include sequencing of 16s rRNA and culturing viable bacteria.1,2 A variety of bacterial phyla have been identified including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, SR1, Tenericutes, and TM7 and a number of genera have been identified within each phylum.1 The bacteria most frequently found on the ISS include species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Micrococcus.2 Experiments to determine the effect of spaceflight or low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on bacteria have determined that different phenotypes are induced in different types of bacteria. Compared with normal gravity controls alterations to growth, culture density, biofilm formation, aggregation, virulence, and changes in resistance to stress from acid, oxidative stress, heat shock, or antibiotics have been identified.2–10 It is not possible to generalize or predict how a bacterial species will react to microgravity or LSMMG. An example is resistance to oxidative stress: exposure to LSMMG increased oxidative stress resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa11 but decreased oxidative stress resistance of Staphylococcus aureus.12 Changes in the bacterial transcriptome11–14 are also induced by microgravity and LSMMG, and changes to the bacterial phenotype are likely due to alterations in the bacterial transcriptome. The diverse phenotypes induced by spaceflight or LSMMG2–7 highlights the need to understand more about how different species of bacteria are altered by microgravity and the importance of identifying key molecules that promote survival under the stress of microgravity. Mycobacterium marinum is a member of a family of closely related mycobacteria, most of which are pathogenic. They include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium ulcerans.15 Although M. tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, live and replicate only in a host in nature,15,16 M. marinum and M. avium grow in macrophage and aquatic environments.16 M. marinum grows at 28–35 °C and infects poikilothermic hosts such as fish and frogs, but can infect humans resulting in granulomatous skin lesions, which pathologically are identical to lesions produced by dermal M. tuberculosis. The pathogenic M. avium complex, which includes the subspecies avium, paratuberculosis, and intracellulare, has been linked with hard-to-treat non-tuberculosis human pulmonary infections in non-immunocompromised17 as well as immunocompromised individuals.18 M. marinum19 and M. avium form biofilms and can grow in biofilms in water distribution systems,20 taps, and showerheads. Thirty percent of biofilms tested from showerheads across the USA contained M. avium even though they were linked to municipal water supplies treated with chlorine.21 M. avium grown in a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine, even when the biofilm is disrupted.22 Pathogenic waterborne mycobacteria could pose a potential threat during space travel not only to astronaut health, but also to the spacecraft environment and potable water. In fact, M. avium was identified in water samples taken from the Russian Mir space station.23 Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to have increased antimicrobial resistance and virulence are a concern inside spacecraft because astronauts already have a compromised immune system, especially when in space for long periods of time.24,25 Uncovering the signaling pathways that result in the altered physiology of bacteria has the potential to reveal new targets for drug development or disinfection that will be essential for long space flights. There are no published studies on the effect of microgravity or LSMMG on waterborne mycobacteria. Hfq has been identified as a factor regulating microgravity gene expression in P. aeruginosa,13 S. aureus,12 and Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium14 (S. typhimurium), but mycobacteria do not encode Hfq.26 M. marinum is closely related genetically to M. tuberculosis and M. avium and has similar mechanisms of infection and survival inside host macrophage. Although all of these mycobacterium species can grow in specialized medium in the laboratory,27 growth of M. marinum even at the lower temperature of 30–32 °C is faster than M. tuberculosis27 and M. avium.28 M. marinum is also a lower risk (bisoafety level 2) to researchers. Hence M. marinum is a good model for pathogenic mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the adaptation of M. marinum to the LSMMG stressful environment and determine how LSMMG alters mycobacterium physiology. Two strains of M. marinum (1218R and LHM4) were used for this study. Strain 1218R was originally isolated from fish and LHM4 was generated from 1218R by integrating a plasmid into the genome that encodes for kanamycin resistance and the red fluorescent protein. Previous work studying the effect of LSMMG on bacteria with doubling times of <1 h exposed the bacteria to LSMMG for 10,29 20,30 24 h11 or 10 generations.31 M. marinum has a doubling time of 6–7 h at 30 °C and hence two exposure times to LSMMG or NG (short ~40 h and long 4 days and ~35 h) were selected to allow the bacteria to undergo multiple replication cycles during the experiments. The exposure protocol was designed so that short and long LSMMG- or NG-exposed cultures were in exponential phase and hence alterations to the transcriptome or resistance to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acid or gamma radiation were due to different exposure times to LSMMG and not due to different phases of growth. In summary, this work characterizes the growth, stress survival, and transcriptome of M. marinum grown under LSMMG and identifies nutrient deprivation as a signal involved in changes to gene expression and the sigma factor SigH as a factor modulating the LSMMG transcriptome in a waterborne mycobacterium.Results The effect of LSMMG exposure time had to be assessed with bacteria in the same phase of growth, as we found stress resistance altered as the M. marinum progressed from early to late exponential phase (data not shown) and it would be expected that the transcriptome of replicating bacteria is very different from bacteria in stationary phase. For the short exposure, M. marinum were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.002 at the initiation of the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) culture to make sure that the bacteria would be in exponential phase (OD600~0.1–0.2) after ~40 h. This exposure time allowed ~6 generations. For the longer exposure time, M. marinum were subjected to 4 days of growth under LSMMG or NG, the bacteria removed from the HARV, re-diluted in fresh medium and the LSMMG or NG exposure continued in new HARVs for a further ~35 h (see Materials and Methods for full details). LSMMG did not alter aggregation of M. marinum Previous published studies observed increased aggregation of bacteria exposed to microgravity or LSMMG.4,12,14 Mycobacterium under normal laboratory conditions grow as aggregates and standard culture procedure27,32 uses Tween 80 in the medium to minimize clumping. Even in the presence of 0.2% Tween 80, M. marinum still aggregate. Cultures exposed to NG or LSMMG for various times were examined by microscopy to determine whether exposure to LSMMG altered aggregation. Similar size aggregates were detected in both LSMMG and NG cultures (Supplementary Figure 1A), so growth under LSMMG and standard culture medium did not increase clumping of M. marinum. To determine whether the Tween 80 in the culture medium prevented the detection of structure alterations under LSMMG, 1218R and LHM4 were grown initially in a tube with 0.2% Tween 80 until OD600 ~1 in the rotating incubator as described in the Materials and Methods section. The cultures were then diluted to OD600 0.002 in growth medium without Tween 80. One dilution for each strain was used to prepare two 50 ml HARVs and a tube culture. The cultures in the tube and HARVs were grown for 67 h (LHM4) or 69 h (1218R). The tube was incubated in the rotating incubator at 120 r.p.m. and the HARVs were grown under NG or LSMMG. The culture in the tube grew as small clumps (data not shown) and clumps were also visible in the HARV cultures. When the culture was removed from the HARVs it was not possible to determine the optical density of the culture as bacteria had adhered to the base of the HARV grown under NG, preventing an accurate measurement. Samples of each culture were examined by microscopy (Supplementary Figure 1B and C) and cording of the mycobacterium was seen in all cultures. This cording structure is known to form in broth as well as biofilms.19,33 Under the conditions examined, there was no obvious difference between the NG and LSMMG cultures. Further studies are required to determine whether there are subtle structure differences between the cords or whether cord formation is accelerated under LSMMG. As growth in the absence of Tween 80 prevents accurate measurements of culture density and total recovery of the culture from the HARVs, all further studies were performed in the presence of 0.2% Tween 80. M. marinum grown under LSMMG transition from exponential phase earlier than NG-exposed M. marinum Thirteen independent cultures of LHM4 and three independent cultures of 1218R were grown continuously for 4 days in 10 ml HARVs under LSMMG or NG and significantly different OD600 were obtained for LSMMG compared with NG cultures (Figure 1a). The OD600 of the LSMMG culture was reduced by at least 50% compared with the NG culture. To determine in more detail how growth was altered by LSMMG, growth studies of LHM4 (Figure 1b) and 1218R (Figure 1c) were performed over a period of 150 h where the OD600 was monitored by removal of a sample of the culture at the different time points. Experiments were performed in triplicate and all data points from these experiments were pooled and plotted to examine the effect of LSMMG on growth (Figure 1b and c). The LSMMG cultures of LHM4 and 1218R had slightly lower OD600 compared with the NG culture at ~37 h after culture initiation and this difference increased with time (Figure 1e and f). This was very consistent and detected in all experiments with both M. marinum strains. A similar result was found when LHM4 colony forming units per ml (CFU/ ml) was plotted against time (Supplementary Figure 2). As the OD600 measurements for the NG cultures began to plateau at around 90 h, indicating an exit from logarithmic growth, the data between 37 and 70 h were considered (Figure 1e and f). Regression analyses determined that during this time period that the data were significantly different (P<0.0001) for the LSMMG and NG cultures of LHM4 and 1218R. To examine the extent of change on growth during this transition from exponential phase, the doubling times during this time period were calculated from Figure 1e and f: doubling times were 10 h (LHM4) and 11 h (1218R) for NG cultures, and 15.5 h (LHM4) and 16 h (1218R) for LSMMG cultures. The LSMMG culture did eventually reach a similar culture density to the NG culture at later time points (Figure 1b). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Growth under LSMMG alters culture density of M. marinum. LHM4 and 1218R was grown in 10 ml HARVs under NG or LSMMG for 4 days continuously and the OD600 determined. The data from 13 HARVs for LHM4 and 3 HARVs for 1218R for each condition was used to obtain the average and s.d. (a). OD600 was monitored for LHM4 (b) and 1218R (c) in 50 ml HARVs. At each time point, a small culture volume (1–2 ml) was removed to measure OD600 and the volume replaced with fresh medium (2–4% total volume). Strain 1218R was also grown in medium with catalase (d). Three independent experiments were performed for each strain and growth condition. As data were not gathered at the exact time point in each experiment, all the data points were pooled for a strain and condition and are shown graphically (b–d). A transition from exponential phase was detected at ~37 h in LSMMG cultures compared with NG cultures. The data between 37 and 70 h for the three experiments were plotted (e, f) and regression analysis performed, demonstrating that the increase in OD600 during this time period was statistically different when the bacteria were grown under NG and LSMMG (P<0.0001).As OD600 can be influenced by size of the bacteria, the diameter and length of 50 bacteria in an LHM4 culture grown for 4 days under LSMMG (OD600=1.3) or NG (OD600=2.3) were determined. No statistical significant difference was found for the diameter (NG=0.72±0.05 μm, LSMMG=0.73±0.07 μm) or the length (NG=2.7±0.45 μm, LSMMG=2.7±0.5 μm) between the two cultures. Published studies have determined that LSMMG induces oxidative stress genes in bacteria;30 suggesting LSMMG disturbs the normal redox environment. Catalase breaks down H2O2 and is present in standard M. tuberculosis medium (3 μg/ml). Growth experiments for 1218R were therefore performed with medium containing catalase (3 μg/ml) to remove extracellular H2O2. No change in growth was detected when the medium contained catalase, which suggests extracellular H2O2 did not hinder growth under LSMMG (Figure 1d). M. marinum transcriptome response to LSMMG RNA samples isolated from triplicate independent cultures of 1218R grown under LSMMG or NG cultures for the short or long exposure times were used for RNA-Seq analyses, and 6–10 million reads were sequenced for each biological sample (Supplementary Table 1). RNA-Seq using 5–10 million non-rRNA reads has previously been found to provide sufficient depth of sequencing to detect the majority of alterations in bacterial gene expression.34 Following transcript quantification a comparison of LSMMG with NG after short or long exposure times (Supplementary Excel Worksheets 1 and 2) identified 562 and 328 genes, respectively, with significantly altered transcript levels. From the 10 categories of mycobacterial genes (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/marinolist.html), the intermediary metabolism and respiration category had the greatest number of genes with significant transcript changes (Supplementary Table 2). To determine the genes with the greatest physiological relevance to growth under LSMMG the real fold change (RFC) was calculated (Supplementary Excel Worksheets). Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was also performed for 9 different genes and the majority of the LSMMG/NG fold changes in expression determined by RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR were similar (Supplementary Table 3). The genes with the greatest RNA-Seq RFC (top 10%) after short and long exposure times are shown in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5. Genes that changed expression ⩾1.5-fold (RFC⩽0.67 or ⩾1.5) by RNA-Seq were identified and the log10 RFC plotted for the genes according to category (Figure 2). The category with the greatest number of genes for LSMMG versus NG at each exposure time (Figure 2a and b) was intermediary metabolism, and there was an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression. The categories of genes relating to the cell wall and the conserved hypotheticals had the next highest number of genes that significantly changed. Even though these categories also had an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression (Figure 2a and b), some genes relating to these two categories had the highest RFC, especially after a short exposure to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Unfortunately the function of the conserved hypothetical genes is unknown. The majority of genes involved in the information pathway and lipid metabolism categories decreased expression, whereas the genes in the PE/PPE and virulence categories increased expression (Figure 2a and b). There were also genes in the regulatory protein category that were significantly changed by LSMMG, but genes were again evenly distributed for increased and decreased expression. When the data from the LSMMG samples for short versus long exposure times were statistically compared, it was evident that gene expression continued to change with greater exposure to LSMMG (Figure 2c), and the categories for cell wall, intermediary metabolism, PE/PPE, and virulence increased expression. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gene expression changes identified by RNA-Seq. Transcriptional profiles were compared between 1218R grown at LSMMG and NG for 40 h (a, LSMMG/NG) or 4 days ~35 h (b, LSMMG/NG) and between 1218R grown under LSMMG for the two time periods (c, 4 days ~35 h/40 h). The significant (P<0.05) changes in transcript levels were identified. The real fold change (RFC) is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG divided by the normalized mean count values for NG. The genes that changed ⩾1.5-fold were assigned to categories (1–9) and the distribution of the RFC is shown graphically. No genes were significantly altered ⩾1.5-fold in the insertion sequences and phage category and so this category is not included. The mean value for the RFC for a category is marked by the black spot and the number of genes in the category is shown in parentheses.To identify genes involved in adaptation to LSMMG, genes were considered that significantly changed ⩾1.5-fold at both the short and long exposure time points (Table 1). The changes for the majority of these 97 genes were very similar at the two time points. Transcript changes include a ~2-fold decrease for ribosomal proteins and a decrease for most of the genes in categories related to lipid metabolism and intermediary metabolism (Table 1). The greatest changes were in genes encoding chaperone proteins. Table 1. M. marinum genes that significantly altered expression when grown under LSMMG for both 40 h, and 4 days ~35 h (LSMMG/NG).

RFC is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG over the normalized mean count values for NG.Expression of cell metabolism genes Groups of genes linked with specific metabolic pathways were examined using hierarchical clustering in GeneSifter to determine whether gene expression changes were linked to growth under LSMMG. Hierarchical clustering of all the LSMMG samples suggests changes in gene expression were linked to LSMMG. Genes involved in glycolysis (12 genes), electron transport chain (ETC, 87 genes), pentose phosphate pathway (7 genes), gluconeogenesis (15 genes), methylcitrate cycle (10 genes), glyoxylate cycle (14 genes), and citric acid cycle (TCA, 19 genes) were examined. The majority of these pathways had few significant changes or changes not related to LSMMG (data not shown). An example is ETC, where 22 genes had significant alterations but the changes were not linked to growth under LSMMG (Supplementary Figure 3A). However, 17/19 TCA genes had altered expression linked to LSMMG (Supplementary Figure 3B). Transcript levels for aconitase decreased after short exposure to LSMMG. Succinate dehydrogenase is also a TCA enzyme, but also forms complex II of the ETC.35,36 There are two forms of succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh1 and Sdh2) and transcript levels of 3 (sdhB-D) of the four genes encoding Sdh2 decreased at the short exposure time point, while transcripts from sdhB and sdhD decreased after long exposure. There was no change in expression of the genes encoding Sdh1. Proline oxidation can also donate electrons to ETC.36 Transcripts from MMAR_4252 (putA, proline dehydrogenase) and MMAR_4253 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase) were increased 2–4-fold by LSMMG after the short exposure time (Supplementary Worksheets 1 and 2). After the long exposure time, only MMAR_4252 was increased 2.6-fold (Table 1). Isocitrate lyase (Icl) is an enzyme that connects the TCA and glyoxylate cycle and transcript levels from icl (MMAR_0792) decreased by ~10-fold in LSMMG bacteria after the long exposure time (Supplementary Table 5). Transcription of genes involved in lipid degradation and catabolism of fatty acids were altered significantly in LSMMG bacteria. We identified 104 genes in M. marinum involved in lipid degradation and 53 had ⩾1.5-fold significant change in transcript levels after growth under LSMMG (Figure 3a). Of the 53 genes, 16 had decreased expression and 37 had increased expression, the majority of which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid β oxidation. Fatty acids are also used for polyketide lipid synthesis of phenolic glycolipids and phthiocerol dimycocerosates, mycolic acid (MA) synthesis, production of cell membrane phospholipids, as well as production of carbon stores in the form of triacylglycerol.37 Although there were no alterations in expression of genes encoding triacylglycerol synthase (MMAR_2634, MMAR_2598, MMAR_1519 and MMAR_1157), genes involved in polyketide lipid synthesis (fadD22 and pks15/1) were decreased 1.5- to 2-fold (Supplementary Excel Worksheets 1 and 2) and multiple genes38 encoding proteins involved in MA synthesis were also decreased (Table 1 and Figure 3b). Two genes (desA3 and desA3_2) encoding membrane-bound desaturases showed increased expression at both time points in LSMMG bacteria (Table 1 and Figure 3b). These desaturases are involved in oleic acid production and potentially the production of cis double bonds in meromycolic acids.38 Figure 3. Open in a new tab Growth under LSMMG increases expression of genes involved in lipid degradation and mycobactin synthesis but decreases expression of genes involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Genes involved in the designated categories lipid degradation (a), mycolic acid synthesis (b) and mycobactin synthesis (c) were identified using the mycobrowser website (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) and the literature.38 The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed using Genesifter. Only genes with ⩾1.5-fold change in expression (P<0.05) were considered. The data were log transformed. The heat maps were generated showing expression in short (growth for ~40 h) and long (growth for 4 days ~35 h) exposure samples. Genes colored brown are discussed in the manuscript text.Mycobactins chelate iron from the environment and are also known to be important for mycobacterial growth during infection of macrophage.39 Sixteen genes involved in mycobactin synthesis were identified and six increased expression after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and ~35 h (Figure 3c).SigH: a possible regulator of the mycobacteria LSMMG response sigH transcript levels increased 1.5-fold at both time points (Table 1). SigH is known to regulate chaperone encoding genes40,41 (hsp and the dnaK, dnaJ, grpE and hspR operon) and hsp transcript levels increased at both time points (Table 1). Transcripts from all the dnaK operon genes increased after ~40 h of LSMMG exposure (Supplementary Table 4 and Excel Worksheet 1), while only transcripts from dnaK and hspR increased after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and ~35 h (Supplementary Table 5 and Excel Worksheet 2). M. tuberculosis SigH directly/indirectly regulated genes have been identified in a study41 where wild-type and sigH mutant M. tuberculosis were allowed to recover after diamide treatment: RNA analysis identified 44 genes at 0 min and 91 genes at 30 min of recovery as SigH-regulated genes. We identified the M. marinum orthologs of these genes (40 at 0 min and 78 at 30 min) and using GeneSifter determined that >50% of these orthologs altered expression significantly after growth under LSMMG (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Changes in expression of SigH-regulated genes show a linkage to growth under LSMMG. Mehr et al.41 treated wild-type and sigH mutant M. tuberculosis with diamide and determined SigH-related gene expression changes after 0 and 30 min recovery time. Peak sigH transcript was at 30 min. M. marinum orthlogs of these genes were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA. The data were log transformed. The heat maps show expression changes during LSMMG and NG for the orthologs of the M. tuberculosis genes that changed after 0 (a) and 30 min (b). Genes colored brown are discussed in the text.Changes in expression of genes related to the enduring hypoxic response and the nutrient starvation response The enduring hypoxic response (EHR)42 and the relA nutrient starvation response43 are well characterized in M. tuberculosis. We identified 147 M. marinum orthologs from the 230 M. tuberculosis genes involved in EHR, and 105 M. marinum orthologs from the 147 M. tuberculosis genes involved in the nutrient starvation response. These orthologs (58 for EHR and 46 for nutrient starvation response) were also found to significantly alter expression⩾1.5-fold due to LSMMG (Figure 5). The EHR genes that overlap with the LSMMG changes in M. marinum (Figure 5a) include sigH and SigH-regulated genes. For M. tuberculosis, all the genes in Figure 5a increase expression during EHR, whereas 25 increased transcript levels under LSMMG. A major group of overlapping genes between the nutrient starvation response in M. tuberculosis and the LSMMG response in M. marinum are related to translation. The nutrient starvation response includes 23 translation-related genes and 22 decrease expression during the response. There are 21 corresponding M. marinum orthologs, 17 changed expression in M. marinum under LSMMG and 16 decreased expression (Figure 5b and Table 1). Figure 5. Open in a new tab The effect of LSMMG on genes involved in the enduring hypoxic response (EHR) or nutrient starvation response. Genes involved in these two stress responses have been identified in M. tuberculosis.42,43 The M. marinum orthologs were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) for the EHR (a) and relA nutrient starvation (b) response43 (Supplemental Data Set 1 and section 3 in ref. 43). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA analysis. The data were log transformed. Genes colored brown are discussed in the text.Comparison of M. marinum exposed to LSMMG and P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight or LSMMG During spaceflight, 167 genes were differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa and Hfq was identified as a transcription regulator of the bacterial response to microgravity13 and LSMMG.11 Mycobacteria do not have a gene encoding Hfq, but there is overlap in the lists of genes that are differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight or LSMMG and M. marinum subjected to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). A hypergeometric distribution test was performed to determine whether the number of genes found to overlap were significant or could have occurred by chance. The number of protein coding sequences in M. marinum is 5,452 (refs 15,44) and from the short exposure to LSMMG there were 562 significant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight (where 167 changes were detected) and 47 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG (where 330 changes were detected). From the long exposure of M. marinum to LSMMG, there were 328 significant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to spaceflight and 34 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG. The number of overlapping genes in each case was found to be significant (short exposure M. marinum and spaceflight P. aeruginosa representation factor 2.2, P<1.513e−6, short exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representation factor 1.4, P<0.012, long exposure M. marinum and spaceflight P. aeruginosa representation factor 3.8, P<2.17e−13, long exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representation factor 1.7, P<0.001). When comparing the LSMMG M. marinum data with the spaceflight data from P. aeruginosa, the largest overlap in downregulated genes encode ribosomal proteins and other common downregulated genes produce proteins involved in transcription and translation. Genes encoding the metabolic enzymes Icl and Sdh2 are also downregulated in both organisms, suggesting similar downregulation of metabolic pathways. Interestingly there were no genes with decreased transcript levels detected for P. aeruginosa grown under LSMMG, but 330 transcript levels increased by ⩾1.5-fold.11 From this list a number of transcripts encoding proteins of similar function were increased in P. aeruginosa subjected to LSMMG but decreased in LSMMG-grown M. marinum (Supplementary Table 7). These include transcripts for 13 ribosomal proteins, Sdh2 (sdhB and sdhD), Icl, RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA) and elongation factor Ts (tsf). A common group of genes with increased transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum and P. aeruginosa were the stress response genes for heat shock and chaperone proteins. Transcriptome data therefore suggest that M. marinum grown under LSMMG exhibit similar stress responses as LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa, but have transcriptional, translational, and metabolic alterations similar to spaceflight-exposed P. aeruginosa.Survival of LHM4 NG- and LSMMG-exposed cultures to stressful conditions Ionizing radiation and H2O2 produce an oxidizing environment in cells. Compared with NG, LSMMG-exposed bacteria showed no change in resistance to ionizing radiation (Figure 6a), but were more sensitive to H2O2 (Figure 6b) with the sensitivity increasing with longer exposure to LSMMG. LHM4 exposed to NG and LSMMG for 4 days and ~35 h were also tested for sensitivity to pH 3.5 for up to 4 h and no cell death occurred (Figure 6c). Figure 6. Open in a new tab LHM4 grown under LSMMG are more sensitive to H2O2 but not gamma radiation or acid in comparison with NG cultures. Bacteria were grown in HARVs under LSMMG or NG for ~40 h (short exposure time) or 4 days ~35 h (long exposure time). Cultures were removed and treated with gamma radiation using a 137Cesium source (a), H2O2 (b), or growth medium at pH 3.5 (c). Bacteria were grown on solid medium and colonies counted. The percent survival was calculated by dividing the colony number/ml by that obtained for a culture treated with no dose at the same time. At least three experiments were performed for each culture and treatment type, except for the short exposure time LSMMG and NG cultures treated with H2O2 where two experiments were performed. The average and s.d. are shown. Survival was compared between the LSMMG and NG samples using the area under the curve and the only statistically significant difference was between the long exposure LSMMG culture and the long exposure NG culture treated with H2O2 (*P=0.004).Discussion Previous studies examining liquid bacterial growth during space travel3 or LSMMG2,3 have found species-specific alterations: LSMMG-grown S. typhimurium had decreased doubling time in minimal medium,29 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis reached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during spaceflight compared with ground controls,45 while S. aureus achieved higher cell densities in the normal gravity control compared with the LSMMG culture.12 In our study, in a 4-day continuous growth culture, M. marinum subjected to NG achieved a higher cell density than the LSMMG culture. As the size of the bacteria did not change and aggregates were disrupted before optical density measurements were determined, the lower LSMMG cell density was likely due to an alteration in growth. A more detailed examination of the growth indicated an early transition of the LSMMG bacteria from exponential phase resulting in a slowing of growth. Even though RNA-Seq analysis was performed at the point where this transition was just detectable, the slowing of growth is apparent from changes in the transcriptome. MA synthesis is linked to new membrane synthesis and cell wall expansion38 and is needed for bacterial cell division, and MA synthesis gene transcript levels decreased ~3-fold under LSMMG. During exponential growth there is also a linear relationship between bacterial growth rate and the number of ribosomes in a cell.46 The slower growing LSMMG M. marinum culture had ~2-fold reduction in transcripts of multiple ribosomal proteins, indicating a downregulation of translation. P. aeruginosa13 and S. typhimurium14 cultured during spaceflight also had decreased ribosomal protein transcripts, but growth studies were not performed for these bacteria. Transcriptome changes imply a nutrient-deprived environment under LSMMG Forty-six M. marinum orthologs of the M. tuberculosis relA nutrient starvation response genes43 had expression changes linked to LSMMG. Nutrient starvation results in decreased growth rate, translation, lipid biosynthesis (e.g., MA synthesis), and downregulation of metabolism.43,47 These phenotypes were also implied from the transcriptome data for LSMMG-exposed M. marinum. Key bacterial metabolic pathways include β-oxidation of fatty acids, ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles.35 In LSMMG M. marinum, a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid degradation increased expression, but icl transcript levels decreased ~10-fold after long exposure to LSMMG. Icl converts isocitrate into glyoxylate, and glyoxylate combined with acetyl CoA from β oxidation of fatty acids produces malate for the glyoxylate cycle.35 Also transcript levels decreased 3–6-fold in LSMMG M. marinum for the WhiB3 transcription regulator, which is implicated in the adaptation of mycobacteria to growth on long-chain fatty acids.48 The transcriptome data therefore suggest energy generation from fatty acids was depressed in LSMMG M. marinum. Decreased transcript levels of genes encoding Sdh2 and aconitase suggest that ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles are depressed in LSMMG M. marinum. Sdh2 is an enzyme that is essential for growth and Sdh1 cannot substitute for all activities of Sdh2 (ref. 49), which links oxidative phosphorylation energy production to carbon metabolism.36 Succinate oxidation generates electrons for ETC, but in mycobacteria proline oxidation can substitute for succinate oxidation under carbon starvation and slow growth conditions.36 The transcriptome data indicate that M. marinum increased proline oxidation under LSMMG; transcript levels increased for proline oxidation enzymes when transcript levels from the Sdh2 genes decreased. Sdh1 and 2 levels in Mycobacterium smegmatis have been linked to energy availability and oxygen levels: under energy-limiting conditions Sdh2 is downregulated and Sdh1 is upregulated, and this is reversed under oxygen-limiting conditions.36 Even though in our study, the genes encoding Sdh1 did not alter expression significantly, the transcript changes for Sdh2 and the proline oxidation enzymes suggest that LSMMG M. marinum could still produce energy by ETC, and were sensing a carbon-starved/energy-limiting environment. Taken together, the slower growth and the transcriptome data relating to translation and metabolism suggest that LSMMG simulates nutrient deprivation conditions in M. marinum. Fluid dynamics in cultures under microgravity or LSMMG are different from NG cultures.8,11 Crabbé et al.11 examined fluid mixing in HARVs subjected to NG and LSMMG by adding a drop of crystal violet to the fluid-filled vessels. This experiment demonstrated different mixing rates under the two conditions: even after 12 h the crystal violet had dispersed only around the circumference of the HARV subjected to LSMMG, while complete dispersal had occurred under NG. This decreased mixing and low fluid shear under LSMMG and the fact that M. marinum are non-motile in liquid culture results in the environment immediately around the bacterium being influenced more by diffusion. Under LSMMG, diffusion is likely the main method moving nutrients to and waste products away from the bacterium. The fluid dynamics in the LSMMG culture could therefore generate a local nutrient-deprived condition. This idea is also supported by increased transcript levels of the WhiB7 transcription regulator and the mycobactin synthesis genes after long exposure to LSMMG. whiB7 is induced by nutrient starvation and growth under low-iron conditions,50,51 while mycobactin synthesis genes are induced under iron-restricted conditions.52 This is very relevant to cultures in potable water during spaceflight, which is where waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria could be found. In fact, M. avium 16s rRNA was identified by PCR amplification in three different water condensation samples from the Mir space station.23Stress response genes Even though there were LSMMG-linked transcript alterations related to M. tuberculosis EHR, the metabolic transcriptome data does not suggest the LSMMG M. marinum were under hypoxia. Many of the EHR genes that changed were stress response genes and included sigH, chaperone and heat-shock-regulated genes. SigH is one of 18 sigma factors in M. marinum53 and sigma factors function in promoter sequence recognition; directing initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase.54 sigH was the only sigma factor gene to increase expression under LSMMG at both the short and long exposure times. Transcript levels of genes regulated directly or indirectly by SigH also changed significantly due to LSMMG exposure. SigH autoregulates its expression by binding to its own promoter and increasing transcription, and SigH is post-translationally regulated by RshA and PknB. RshA binds to SigH and prevents SigH from binding to RNA polymerase and SigH-RshA binding is disrupted by heat or redox stress,55 as well as phosphorylation by PknB.56 Small/no changes were detected in rshA and pknB transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum, but conditions inside the LSMMG mycobacteria could have induced a substantial activity change in SigH by disrupting binding to RshA. A 1.5-fold increase in the sigH transcript is implicated in the 40-fold increase in hsp transcript after long exposure to LSMMG. SigH is also required for the induction of sigB and sigE,54 and transcript levels from these genes increased after exposure to LSMMG for 4 days and ~35 h albeit by a small amount (Figure 4). SigE has been implicated in the repression of icl,57 so increased SigE expression after the long exposure time to LSMMG may explain the decrease in the icl transcript. SigH is known to be involved in the response of mycobacteria to oxidative stress as well as heat shock. Therefore M. marinum exposed to LSMMG would be expected to be resistant to H2O2. AlgU is another alternate sigma factor involved in heat shock and oxidative stress that has been implicated in the LSMMG response of P. aeruginosa11 and LSMMG-exposed P. aeruginosa were more resistant to H2O2 treatment.11 However, LSMMG-exposed LHM4 were more sensitive to H2O2 in our study. LHM4 was derived from 1218R by integration of an RFP-expressing plasmid (pDEAM2) at the attB site in the genome. The attB site is used to integrate plasmids into mycobacterium, as integration does not disrupt any genes.58 Previous studies have demonstrated that a M. marinum strain similar to LHM4 that was derived by pDEAM2 integration into 1218R had similar growth characteristics and virulence in Medaka fish to 1218R.59 We also determined that LHM4 and 1218R had similar growth characteristics under LSMMG. Therefore, LSMMG-exposed 1218R would be expected to be sensitive to H2O2. Interestingly, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii grown under LSMMG have also been found to be more sensitive to H2O2 than NG controls.12,60 A second group using S. typhimurium did find that LSMMG induced resistance to H2O2 and that resistance involved induction of catalase.30 Sensitivity to H2O2 could be altered by the availability of detoxification enzymes (catalase and alkyl hydroperoxidases), proteins involved in ‘repairing’ oxidized proteins (thioredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases) or redox buffers such as mycothiol and ergothioneine.51 Transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins or the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mycothiol and ergothioneine did not significantly decrease in LSMMG M. marinum, which suggests these protection mechanisms were not compromised compared with the NG control. In fact, transcriptome data indicate that the trxB1 transcript, which encodes one of the thioredoxins, increased by 4-fold after the long exposure time. Cysteine, which is key to many of the protecting enzymes/compounds, was also being conserved and production increased: the transcript of cysteine desulfurase decreased by 2-fold after LSMMG exposure and the cysK2 transcript increased ~4-fold after the long exposure to LSMMG. Even though LSMMG M. marinum were more sensitive to H2O2, they had no change in sensitivity to killing by ionizing radiation compared with the NG control. Ionizing radiation and H2O2 are similar in that they both induce oxidative stress and generate similar types of DNA damage61 and DNA is a critical target in cells for cell killing. Lack of enhanced killing by radiation suggests the increased sensitivity to H2O2 was due to a different mechanism of radical formation/ cell killing by H2O2 in LSMMG bacteria that could not be defended against by the SigH response. In mycobacteria, the outer cell wall is the first line of defense against H2O2. This is not the case for ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy in the molecules of the cell and generates DNA damage by depositing energy directly on the DNA or by depositing energy in water, which produces hydroxyl radicals that then induce DNA damage.62 The energy deposited by the radiation can also generate lipid peroxides and oxidation of protein molecules, but the delivery of the energy to the macromolecules is not impeded by the structures surrounding or within the bacterium. Therefore, ionizing radiation energy deposition and DNA damage production will occur even if the cell wall composition changes. H2O2 can pass through lipid bilayers but is broken down to hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction, which requires Fe2+ (ref. 63). The hydroxyl radicals can generate lipid peroxides from reaction with lipids in the cell wall that can diffuse and generate DNA damage.64 The composition of the cell wall and the iron content of the cell could therefore modify radical formation and alter the sensitivity of the cell to H2O2. There were a substantial number of transcript changes in LSMMG M. marinum related to the cell wall. Transcripts of genes related to MA and phenolic glycolipid synthesis were decreased, while transcripts encoding proteins involved in modifying the types of MA were increased. LSMMG-exposed M. marinum also had an increase in transcripts related to mycobactin synthesis and mycobactins bind iron from the environment and transport the charged iron across the hydrophobic cell wall.39 An increase in mycobactin synthesis could therefore increase iron content in the mycobacterium. Alterations to mycobactin synthesis and to the composition of the mycobacterium cell wall could therefore explain why the LSMMG-exposed mycobacterium, even with the sigH operon response, were more sensitive to H2O2 but not ionizing radiation. The changes at the cell wall did not sensitize the LSMMG M. marinum to pH 3.5 and so cell wall lipid composition may not influence acid resistance. Other bacteria exposed to LSMMG have also been found not to have increased sensitivity to killing by acid60 even though they were more sensitive to H2O2. Recently, M. tuberculosis acid resistance was linked to asparagine metabolism.65 An asparagine transporter AnsP2 imports asparagine into the bacterium where asparaginase AnsA breaks down asparagine to aspartate with the production of ammonia. The ammonia buffers hydrogen ions by forming NH4+. AnsA is also secreted to perform this reaction in the environment around the mycobacterium. In M. marinum, AnsP2 is encoded by MMAR_0627 and AnsA is encoded by MMAR_2360. Transcript levels of these genes did not alter during exposure to LSMMG and hence the ability to produce ammonia may not have changed in LSMMG-exposed M. marinum. This may explain why LSMMG-exposed M. marinum were not more sensitive to killing by acid.Could LSMMG alter the virulence of M. marinum? sigB, E and H as well as hsp and dnaK are induced when M. marinum infect fish or are ingested by mosquito larvae,53 and M. marinum ingested by mosquito larvae are more virulent in fish compared with in vitro cultured M. marinum.59 Exposure to the mosquito larvae gut therefore primes the M. marinum for survival inside fish macrophage. The hsp gene is also the most induced M. tuberculosis gene during macrophage infection,52 and sigH mutants of M. tuberculosis and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis have reduced survival in animal infection models.66,67 Induction of the SigH stress response by LSMMG before infection should aid survival of mycobacteria in macrophage and potentially increase virulence. The transcriptome of LSMMG M. marinum is also similar to mycobacteria inside macrophage in that they have altered growth and metabolism to survive under a nutrient- and iron-starved environment.39,43,52 LSMMG increased transcripts involved in lipid degradation and mycobacteria inside macrophage use host lipids for a source of energy.37 However, Icl expression would need to increase; studies have shown that Icl is essential to connect lipid degradation with the glyoxylate shunt, and is required for survival in animals.35 Even though LSMMG M. marinum do have a number of adaptations that would prime them for increased virulence, the enhanced killing by H2O2 is likely to be detrimental for bacterial survival inside macrophage. Future studies examining LSMMG- or spaceflight-exposed M. marinum survival inside macrophage and fish are needed to determine whether M. marinum in space could pose a risk to the health of astronauts. As M. marinum is an accepted model of waterborne mycobacteria and M. tuberculosis, these results do have implications for other pathogenic mycobacteria exposed to LSMMG as they may respond with similar transcriptome changes.Materials and methods Bacterial strains and culture M. marinum strain 1218R,53 a strain isolated from infected fish, and a derivative of this strain, LHM4, were used for this study. LHM4 carries an integrated plasmid pDEAM2, which encodes red fluorescent protein and confers kanamycin resistance. Bacteria were grown in the dark at 30 °C in tubes in a rotating incubator (120 r.p.m.)27 or in HARVs attached to a rotating cell culture system (RCCS, Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with ADS (5% BSA Fraction V, 2% Dextrose, 0.81% NaCl) to 10%, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg cycloheximide/ml, and 0.2% Tween 80. Cultures were also grown on solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% ADS, 0.5% glycerol, and 100 μg cycloheximide/ml. LHM4 cultures also contained 20 μg kanamycin/ml. To initiate cultures, solid medium was inoculated from a frozen stock and incubated for ~7 days to obtain colonies. Colonies were used to inoculate tube cultures (~3 ml). The tube cultures were grown for 5–7 days to an OD600 ~1. This tube culture was then diluted to OD600 0.0005 or 0.002 before growth in 10 or 50 ml HARVs, respectively. The lower OD600 of the culture at the start of growth in the 10 ml HARVs prevented the cultures from being at saturation density for the majority of the 4-day exposure time. For the short exposure time, the cultures were grown in 50 ml HARVs. For the long exposure, the cultures were grown in 10 ml HARVs for 4 days and then re-diluted to OD600 0.002 in 50 ml HARVs for another ~35 h. For NG, HARVs were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis parallel to the direction of gravitational force, while they were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational force for LSMMG.3Growth studies For the continuous growth studies, one large volume of OD600 0.0005 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two 10 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. After 4 days the cultures were removed and the OD600 was determined. The statistical difference between the LSMMG and NG cultures was tested by a T-test performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Gary, NC, USA). To examine culture density during exponential growth, one large volume of OD600 0.002 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two 50 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. Where specified, 3 μg catalase/ml (0.06 U/ml; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was included. Bacteria were grown for ~150 h but the HARVs were stopped to remove samples (1–2 ml). Liquid medium was added to the HARV to replace the removed sample volume (2–4% of the volume) to maintain a low-shear environment. In order to obtain accurate OD600 and CFU measurements, a disaggregation procedure was used: SDS (final concentration 0.01%) was added; the culture was passed through a 27.5 gauge needle and either vortexed before measurement of the OD600 or preparation of dilutions, or the bacteria were allowed to settle for 5 min before growth on solid medium. Use of the syringe needle, vortexing, and then allowing the culture to settle before plating on solid medium is standard procedure for mycobacterium.32 Colonies from each sample were grown on at least two plates of solid medium for 7–10 days. Colonies were counted for each time point and the CFU/ml calculated. Preliminary experiments confirmed by microscopy that disaggregation of cultures was achieved using the syringe needle, and initial experiments determined that the addition of the SDS to the NG and LSMMG cultures only during the disaggregation and dilution stage did not alter colony forming ability (data not shown). To determine statistical differences between LSMMG and NG cultures during the 37–70 h time period of growth, regression analysis was performed on the OD600 data using SAS 9.4 (SAS).Size of bacterium A portion of the LHM4 culture grown for 4 days in a 10 ml HARV was passed through a 27.5 gauge needle and fixed by the addition of 30 μl 4% paraformaldehyde to 10 μl of culture. Samples were placed at 4 °C for at least 24 h before the measurement of the diameter and length of 50 bacteria using microscopy. The Instat3 program and the Unpaired T-test or the Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the lengths and diameters of the bacterium.RNA preparation RNA extraction from M. marinum strain 1218R was performed according to Rustad et al.68 RNA integrity (Supplementary Table 1) was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantitated using the Qubit RNA BR assay (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA).RNA-Seq analyses RNA samples were subjected to DNase treatment, purification with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and removal of the rRNA and preparation of the RNA-Seq libraries using the ScriptSeq Complete kit for bacteria (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). The DNA libraries (4 nmol/l) were pooled, denatured with 0.2 mol/l sodium hydroxide, and diluted to 12 pmol/l. A 76-cycle paired-end read sequencing run was performed on an Illumina Miseq desktop sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, USA). The number of sequence reads is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Seventy-five base-paired-end RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the M. marinum strain M genome (Genbank accession number CP000854) using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) aligner. Reads were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute, http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/home). Reads were aligned to the M. marinum strain M transcriptome using RSEM version 1.2.9 for transcript quantification. The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) was calculated for each gene and sample gene level differential expression analysis was performed using EBseq version 1.1.5 within RSEM. For the short or long exposure times, the LSMMG samples were compared with NG samples. The LSMMG samples from the two exposure times (short and long) were also compared. Changes in expression were significant if P<0.05. The functions of genes were assigned according to the Marinolist (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/marinolist.html). Pathway assignment used the Marinolist advanced search and the literature, and M. marinum orthologs of M. tuberculosis genes were identified using http://tuberculist.epfl.ch. Transcript levels for the genes assigned to pathways were analyzed and heat maps generated using GeneSifter (http://www.geospiza.com/Products/AnalysisEdition.shtml). RNA-Seq data has been deposited in the GeneLab database.Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR RNA samples were treated with DNase and converted to cDNA using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase. qPCR reactions in duplicate were performed with primers (Supplementary Table 8) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The cDNA level for transcripts was normalized to the cDNA level for 16s rRNA for each sample. This ratio was averaged for the three independent samples and the fold change in expression was calculated by dividing the LSMMG average by the NG average.Survival studies LHM4 were removed from the HARV and the OD600 measured in a sample after disaggregation. Bacteria were in exponential phase (OD600 0.09–0.2). For radiation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) studies, bacteria were centrifuged and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 80 (Tw-PBS), before resuspension at OD600 ~0.2 in Tw-PBS. Two samples (200 μl in a sealed tube) were prepared for each time point or dose. One sample was treated (1–4 h) with 5 mmol/l H2O2 at 30 °C or with gamma radiation (100–400 Gy) at room temperature. The second sample was not treated and was used as the control to determine the CFU/ml at zero treatment at the time point. A similar method was used to treat the bacteria with acid. The bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended at OD600 ~0.2 in growth medium (control) or growth medium at pH 3.5. A small amount of one mole per liter citric acid was added to the medium to reach pH 3.5. Once the bacteria were resuspended, the pH was checked using pH paper. The control and acid-treated samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1–4 h. After all treatment regimens, bacteria were disaggregated and diluted as described above and grown on three plates containing solid medium. Bacteria were incubated at 30 °C for 7–10 days and the CFU/ml calculated for each control and treated sample. Survival was calculated by: %Survival=AvgCFU/mloftreatedcultureAvgCFU/mlofcontrolculture×100 The survival data were compared by calculating the area under the curve for each data set using the Trapezoidal Rule, and the Student’s T-test was used to compare the values. These statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS).Acknowledgments We thank Ms Paula Polk in the Genomic Core at LSUHSC for performing the preparation and sequencing of RNA-Seq samples.

    "abstract": "Abstract Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h−1) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence. Key words: mechanostimulation, memory, clinorotation speed and direction, signal persistence, signal saturation",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plants respond to environmental stimuli such as gravity, light, water, wind and touch. The gravitropic response is an often-cited example of biological signal perception, processing (transduction) and response. Signal perception is attributed to sedimenting or moving amyloplasts.1 The physical process is then converted into a biochemical signal that elicits a growth response in the shoot and roots, where differential elongation on the top and bottom flank reestablishes the gravitropic set-point angle. The curvature is the final step in a series of complex processes2,3 that include redistribution of auxin (the Cholodny-Went hypothesis), different sensitivities toward auxin and the ability of cells to retain wall plasticity.4 While the detailed analysis of the gravitropic signal processing has made significant progress, signal retention or longevity received little attention. The concept of signal persistence inevitably leads to the broader issue of defining processes or conditions responsible for the coordination of more than one stimulus and some evaluation of the significance of the stimuli that determine the overall response such as the curvature after gravistimulation. Any type of signal persistence represents some type of memory, which is typically not attributed to organisms such as plants. However, there are numerous examples of memory effects. Perhaps the earliest tests of induced memory were reported as a consequence of puncturing cotyledons of Bidens pilosus L.5,6 The memory effect depended on the removal of the apex; the location and number of injuries and could be categorized as short- and long-term memory. Other retention of mechanostimulation pertains to the hair cells of the Venus fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula);7,8 the sensitivity of staminal filaments in thistles,9 and probably additional but undocumented phenomena. Memory effects have been linked to temperature10–12 drought stress,13,14 ozone stress,15 and herbivory.16,17 As diverse as the remembered stimuli are the underlying mechanisms of memory function. Cold memory depends on methylation of cold-responsive genes18,19 that integrates week-long temperature shifts for robust flower induction20 and extends over generations.21 In addition to epigenetic processes, excess Cl- ions can affect multi-generational changes.22 Successful defense mechanisms to previously-experienced herbivory may be linked to biosynthetic pathways, enhanced sensitivity to metabolites, small RNAs,23 or elevated levels of ABA.24 Memory, although even mathematically modeled,25 is difficult to characterize especially for gravistimulation, because an organ (e.g., a horizontally reoriented root) perceives the stimulus for an extended time, during which the stimulus diminishes with the sine of the achieved curvature. The complexity of determining the longevity of a stimulus is further compromised by the variability of the gravitropic set point angle26 and its modulation by other factors such as light.27 Gravity compensation by clinorotation can be used to distinguish stimulus and response processes because it is possible to separate a pulse of unilateral gravistimulation (angular reorientation) from clinorotation, i.e., gravity-compensated, but omnilateral mechanostimulation. This approach has been used for the determination of the minimal (presentation) time required to elicit curvature.28,29 Despite the usefulness of a clinostat as a gravity compensator, it introduces its own problems such as the destruction of columella cells in the root cap.30,31 Clinostat-induced complications are likely to interfere with the original gravistimulus and sensed and probably processed as mechanostimulation that is superimposed to the gravity stimulus and response. A sufficiently small angular velocity during clinorotation is likely to minimize not only centrifugal effects but also damage is response to constant reorientation. Although clinostats are traditionally used at one to two revolutions per minute, a thorough analysis of the angular velocity has not been done despite the possibility of separating gravicompensation (lack of induction of curvature in examined organs) from effects of mechanostimulation (the response of tissue compression and stretching during periodic weight-changes, or (over)stimulation of gravisensors (amyloplast movement and statocyte stimulation). Therefore, varying the angular velocity of a clinostat but maintaining all other experimental parameters is likely to identify mechanostimulatory effects that affect gravicompensation. Such separation can then be used to estimate the persistence of a gravity stimulus. Similarly, increasing the duration of gravistimulation will estimate the amount of time required to saturate the gravitropic signal. The direction of clinorotation, e.g., rotation around the longitudinal axis or an axis perpendicular to the root growth direction has been shown to affect the stress level32 and therefore can be used to distinguish stimulation of receptors in lateral columella cell regions from domain characteristic for apical and basal wall regions. We attempt to provide insight in the memory capacity of the root gravisensing system of flax seedlings as a function of angular velocity over one order of magnitude (one octave) while remaining below the threshold level of gravisensitivity (10−3 g equivalents33–35) as a result of centrifugal forces. The results indicate a pronounced effect of the direction of clinorotation on response to but not memory of the stimulus.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant material and experimental procedure. Flax (Linum usitatissimum) seeds were soaked in distilled water for 10 min. Eight seeds were aligned along the edge of germination paper (36 x 16 mm), such that the micropyle was oriented perpendicular to the long side and pointing away from the paper. The seeds adhered to the paper because of the mucilage produced during soaking. The paper strips were allowed to dry completely and then placed on a piece of foam (40 x 12 mm) that was glued to a square plastic Petri dish (9 x 9 cm). After soaking foam and additional paper that lined the surface of the dish with deionized water, the dish was covered and the seeds germinated in a vertical position at 28°C in darkness. Gravistimulation and clinorotation. After 24 h, the Petri dishes were rotated such that the roots were horizontally positioned for 5, 10 or 15 min. After reorientation (gravistimulation), the Petri dish was immediately clinorotated either horizontally (the longitudinal axis of the roots remained perpendicular to the gravity vector) or vertically (the seedlings were reoriented back vertically). Controls were grown vertically under identical conditions without clinorotation. Clinorotation was performed using a computer-controlled stepper motor (Hurst PAS3206-004) at speeds of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 rpm for 6 h. Video imaging and analysis. Images of the dishes were taken after each rotation under infrared LED illumination (λmax 850 nm) with a CCTV Camera (Model Panasonic WV-BP334) fitted with zoom lens 12.5∼75 mm (Sony, Model No. 778057, Japan) and analyzed at 5 min intervals (Image J, v. 1.39 u) for angles between the basal portion of the root and the curving tip. Root length was measured in 10 min intervals and the growth rate expressed as mm h−1. Statistics. Three Petri dishes were examined for each experimental condition; 15 out of 24 seedlings were analyzed. The data were statistically examined using SAS (GLM, SAS version 9.1) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons.",
    "results": "Results Growth rates. The average growth rate of vertically grown, nonclinorotated roots (controls) was 0.81 ± 0.03 mm h−1. The speed of clinorotation did not affect growth of horizontally clinorotated roots but growth rates of vertically clinorotated roots were 7% lower than controls or horizontally clinorotated roots (Table 1). The R2 value (typically >0.99) indicates high linearity of root growth regardless of the type of clinorotation and demonstrates that no changes in root growth occurred in response to gravistimulation or the speed of clinorotation. Table 1. Growth rates (mm h−1) of flax Roots clinorotated vertically and horizontally Open in a new tab Effect of reorientation time. Although control roots did not show consistent curvature, they exhibited some random tip movements. The deviation from the straight trajectory measured between 0° and 4° (Fig. 1A–E). This value was set as a threshold value to differentiate true curvature (exceeding the threshold value) from nutation (random movements, typically less than 4 degrees). The maximum extent of curvature increased with the stimulation time and ranged between 5° and 7° (Fig. 1F–J) for 5 min stimulation, between 3° and 10° (Fig. 1K–O) for 10 min of reorientation and between 5° to 10° (Fig. 1P–T) after 15 min of reorientation. Time of reorientation significantly enhanced the extent of curvature (p < 0.05). Although the extent of curvature increased with duration of reorientation, there was no significant difference in the extent of curvature after 10 min (Fig. 1K–O) and 15 min (Fig. 1P–T). Therefore, we consider the gravity signal saturated after 10 min of reorientation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Curvature profile of 6 h horizontally (solid lines) and vertically (dashed lines) clinorotated, 32 h old flax roots. The columns represent the time of reorientation before the onset of clinorotation; rows represent the speed of clinorotation. Curvature (in degrees) is shown as the running average (n = 3) of degrees ± standard error, n = 15. Direction of rotation. Horizontally clinorotated roots curved significantly stronger than vertically clinorotated roots (F(1,598) = 8.35, p = 0.004), Figure 1F–T. Vertically clinorotated roots showed no difference between 5, 10 or 15 min reorientation. Angular velocity. Curvature in horizontally clinorotated roots increased in response to increasing speed of rotation but decreased in vertically clinorotated roots (Fig. 1F–T). Angular velocity significantly affected the extent of curvature of clinorotated roots regardless of direction of clinorotation (F(4,295) = 6.83, p < 0.001). In vertically rotated roots, the difference in curvature between 5 rpm and all other angular velocities was significant. Similarly, horizontally clinorotated roots were affected by the rate of rotation (F(4,295) = 5.693, p < 0.001) and the roots curved maximally at 5 rpm (Fig. 1). Signal persistence. To determine the time for which a signal remains effective, the time course of curvature holds important clues. As long as a signal generates enhanced curvature i.e., the slope of the graphs in Figure 1 is positive, the signal must persist. Therefore, the time of maximum curvature was used as measure for signal persistence. The maximum root curvature was obtained within 2 h regardless of reorientation time or rotational speed. Thus, the gravitropic signal persisted at least for 2 h. Despite the general consistency of maximal curvature, variations on other parameters were observed. Reorientation for 5 min and 0.5 rpm clinorotation did not produce curvature (Fig. 1F); at 1, 2, 3 rpm curvature occurred within 10 min of clinorotation and maximum curvature varied with the speed and direction of rotation. Following maximum curvature, the curvature angle decreased and by the end of 240 to 300 min roots began to straighten at a rate similar to the rate of curvature (Fig. 1G–J). Ten minute reoriented roots began to curve within 10 to 20 min of clinorotation and maximum curvature varied with speed and direction of rotation. After 300 min of clinorotation, the roots began to straighten regardless of time of reorientation, angular velocity or direction of clinorotation. During the observation period of 6 h, straightening was not followed by any type of overcompensation and also indicates that curvature did not arise spontaneously or autonomously. Therefore, signal persistence is limited to the observed maximum of curvature.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The data indicate that the reorientation stimulus led to increasing curvature for about 2 h regardless of the magnitude (duration) of the stimulation and the speed of clinorotation. The 2-h time frame therefore represents a type of memory that pertains to the retention of a physiological stimulus. Despite the persistence of the signal, the magnitude of the response was affected by the type and speed of clinorotation. Because clinorotation affects intracellular distribution of organelles, in particular amyloplasts, it is justified to state that mechanostimulation modifies the strength of the curvature response. A similar conclusion was derived from other measurements, where mechanostimulation was shown to amplify the graviresponse.44 However, in these experiments mechanostimulation was provided by oscillating seedlings prior to gravistimulation. Interestingly, the oscillatory enhancement had a half-time of 20 min.44 The difference between the longevity of the two types of stimulation indicates that the gravisensing mechanism is capable of integrating different mechanostimuli. Because the reorientation stimulus lasted for about 2 h, additional stimuli that occur during this time span are likely to become integrated into previous signal transduction and response events and may not have independent effects. This notion and the observation that different angular velocities during clinorotation affect the magnitude of the response, suggests that the understanding of clinorotation as a gravi-compensator (constantly changing the gravity vector) or a stimulus (rotation) that has to be faster than the response time is insufficient. The demonstrated effect of the rotational velocity on the magnitude of the response further suggests that the classic approach of using clinorotation to determine presentation times,34 gravisensitivity3 or lag times36 is too simplistic. The difference between vertical and horizontal clinorotation was not the result of (adaptive) changes in growth rates. The root growth rate was linear (Table 1), regardless of the rate of rotation. The growth rate in horizontally clinorotated roots was equal to that of vertically-grown, non-reoriented roots. In contrast, vertical clinorotation reduced the growth rate. These results suggest that mass-shifting parallel to the root axis inhibits growth while lateral stimulation does not reduce growth. The difference may be attributable to different sensitivities of lateral membranes compared to upper and lower cell membranes in gravi- or mass sensitive (columella) cells. However, the difference may also pertain to cells in the elongation zone; vertical clinorotation may release more auxin than horizontal clinorotation. Auxin and ethylene are potent root growth inhibitors,37 and likely related to clinorotation-induced growth changes; additional experiments will be required to identify to what extent the distribution of these hormones are affected by clinorotation. The curvature profile of non-gravistimulated roots fluctuated near the plumb line (0°), and demonstrates that clinorotation itself did not induce curvature and that clinorotation did not enhance or cause fluctuations. Reorientation intervals of 5, 10 and 15 min were chosen because they were longer than the presentation time38,39 but less than the time necessary to complete curvature. Although direction and speed of clinorotation significantly affected curvature (Fig. 1), the extent of curvature did not increase after 10 min of reorientation. The maximal response after 10 min reorientation coincides with the time course of statolith sedimentation to the new lower cell wall in Arabidopsis statocytes.40 Although flax and Arabidopsis may have similar sedimentation kinetics, the saturation of the graviresponse after 10 min is also supported by our observation of maximal curvature after 10 min reorientation. Investigations with excess starch mutants indicate that gravisensing is not saturated41 and studies of the presentation time show that much shorter reorientation times than signal saturation are sufficient to induce curvature and suggest that amyloplast sedimentation is not necessary for the initiation of gravitropism.40 While earlier studies focused on the detection limit (presentation time) that is sufficient to induce curvature,28,35 this study demonstrates saturation of the gravity stimulus likely coincides with the amyloplast sedimentation. Studies on gravity-induced gene expression, hormone redistribution and signal transduction should use this time as reference point for maximal effects of a (single) acceleration or reorientation stimulus. Several studies reported effects of horizontal clinorotation on gravicurvature.3,42 Cress roots that were clinorotated vertically for 6 h showed auto-straightening,42 similar to our data (Fig. 1). Auto-straightening may result from diminishing signal persistence (lack of a lateral signal) or represent the tendency of growing structures to follow a straight trajectory. The onset of auto straightening (end of signal persistence) thus may depend at least to some extent on age, growth and meristematic activity42 but not necessarily on auxin gradients.43 Thus the memory of the gravity signal weakens as the tissue ages and the auxin signal diminishes. The stronger auto-straightening in vertically clinorotated roots in combination with the reduced growth rate and reduced curvature indicates that vertical clinorotation inhibits the formation of lateral auxin gradients or facilitates the uniform redistribution of growth regulators more than horizontal clinorotation. Amplification of curvature by faster horizontal clinorotation (Fig. 1) corresponds to an earlier report, which showed that mechanostimulation at 5 Hz enhanced graviresponse44 and is in line with theoretical calculations that implicate the cytoskeleton in force-transduction events.45 Five Hertz corresponds to 300 rpm, a velocity that would exceed the threshold centrifugal forces (<0.0005 g, reviewed in ref. 33–35) for the thickness of a root (radius ∼0.2 mm), and even for a typical single cell (∼10 µm diameter). However, stronger curvature after faster rotation (e.g., 5 rpm) suggests that rotation affects the extent of curvature; the radius of our experimental setup (20 mm) was below the threshold of centrifugal forces (<0.0005 g). So far no reports exist on the effects of different rotational speed; additional experimentation may show that angular speed slower than 1 rpm may dampen graviresponsiveness even more than shown in this report. Thus, the rate of clinorotation affects the assessment of the gravitropic system in plants. The dependency of curvature on angular velocity suggests that presentation times may depend on the rate of clinorotation. The ability to perceive and store/retain the gravity signal for an extended time represents a type of memory. However, the response is short-lived (∼2 h) and clearly different from neurological bases of memory in animals. If signal saturation requires 10 min, the total retention time of the stimulus amounts to the duration of maximum curvature minus the stimulation time; i.e., if maximum curvature is achieved at 120 min, the signal persistence amounts to 110 min. The key factors involved in this plant memory may be the velocity at which auxin (sometimes likened to a neurotransmitter),46 is redistributed and equilibrates among the differentially elongating tissues. The signal persistence of about 2 h coincides with the reported pattern of auxin flow that includes auxin redistribution and movement from the cap to the elongation zone.46 Since asymmetric auxin flow is dependent on the relocalization of PIN proteins, it is possible that the “memory” is related to the stability of PIN relocalization. PIN 3, which is located in the columella cells, re-localized within 2 min from the basal side to the lateral side of the columella.47 PIN3 proteins likely determine the initial direction of auxin flow within the root cap47,48 and PIN 2 facilitates auxin flow from the columella to the elongation zone.49,50 Another factor that could affect signal persistence is the actin cytoskeleton. Although actin is not involved in the initial perception,51 it may downregulate uneven auxin distribution or contribute to ion channel activation.52 Further work is needed to assess the time and extent of PIN relocalization as a function of angular velocity.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Angular velocity and direction interfere with the graviresponse mechanism in roots. Independent of velocity and direction of clinorotation, the gravity signal persisted for 2 h and 10 min of reorientation sufficed to saturate the gravitropic signal. Future studies will investigate to what extent this phenomenon depends on auxin distribution, cytoskeletal network, metabolism, other signaling molecules or changes in gene activation. Differences in curvature after vertical and horizontal clinorotation offer the opportunity to identify structures or processes that distinguish the direction of clinorotation and contribute to the magnitude of differential elongation.",

The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence. Key words: mechanostimulation, memory, clinorotation speed and direction, signal persistence, signal saturationIntroduction Plants respond to environmental stimuli such as gravity, light, water, wind and touch. The gravitropic response is an often-cited example of biological signal perception, processing (transduction) and response. Signal perception is attributed to sedimenting or moving amyloplasts.1 The physical process is then converted into a biochemical signal that elicits a growth response in the shoot and roots, where differential elongation on the top and bottom flank reestablishes the gravitropic set-point angle. The curvature is the final step in a series of complex processes2,3 that include redistribution of auxin (the Cholodny-Went hypothesis), different sensitivities toward auxin and the ability of cells to retain wall plasticity.4 While the detailed analysis of the gravitropic signal processing has made significant progress, signal retention or longevity received little attention. The concept of signal persistence inevitably leads to the broader issue of defining processes or conditions responsible for the coordination of more than one stimulus and some evaluation of the significance of the stimuli that determine the overall response such as the curvature after gravistimulation. Any type of signal persistence represents some type of memory, which is typically not attributed to organisms such as plants. However, there are numerous examples of memory effects. Perhaps the earliest tests of induced memory were reported as a consequence of puncturing cotyledons of Bidens pilosus L.5,6 The memory effect depended on the removal of the apex; the location and number of injuries and could be categorized as short- and long-term memory. Other retention of mechanostimulation pertains to the hair cells of the Venus fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula);7,8 the sensitivity of staminal filaments in thistles,9 and probably additional but undocumented phenomena. Memory effects have been linked to temperature10–12 drought stress,13,14 ozone stress,15 and herbivory.16,17 As diverse as the remembered stimuli are the underlying mechanisms of memory function. Cold memory depends on methylation of cold-responsive genes18,19 that integrates week-long temperature shifts for robust flower induction20 and extends over generations.21 In addition to epigenetic processes, excess Cl- ions can affect multi-generational changes.22 Successful defense mechanisms to previously-experienced herbivory may be linked to biosynthetic pathways, enhanced sensitivity to metabolites, small RNAs,23 or elevated levels of ABA.24 Memory, although even mathematically modeled,25 is difficult to characterize especially for gravistimulation, because an organ (e.g., a horizontally reoriented root) perceives the stimulus for an extended time, during which the stimulus diminishes with the sine of the achieved curvature. The complexity of determining the longevity of a stimulus is further compromised by the variability of the gravitropic set point angle26 and its modulation by other factors such as light.27 Gravity compensation by clinorotation can be used to distinguish stimulus and response processes because it is possible to separate a pulse of unilateral gravistimulation (angular reorientation) from clinorotation, i.e., gravity-compensated, but omnilateral mechanostimulation. This approach has been used for the determination of the minimal (presentation) time required to elicit curvature.28,29 Despite the usefulness of a clinostat as a gravity compensator, it introduces its own problems such as the destruction of columella cells in the root cap.30,31 Clinostat-induced complications are likely to interfere with the original gravistimulus and sensed and probably processed as mechanostimulation that is superimposed to the gravity stimulus and response. A sufficiently small angular velocity during clinorotation is likely to minimize not only centrifugal effects but also damage is response to constant reorientation. Although clinostats are traditionally used at one to two revolutions per minute, a thorough analysis of the angular velocity has not been done despite the possibility of separating gravicompensation (lack of induction of curvature in examined organs) from effects of mechanostimulation (the response of tissue compression and stretching during periodic weight-changes, or (over)stimulation of gravisensors (amyloplast movement and statocyte stimulation). Therefore, varying the angular velocity of a clinostat but maintaining all other experimental parameters is likely to identify mechanostimulatory effects that affect gravicompensation. Such separation can then be used to estimate the persistence of a gravity stimulus. Similarly, increasing the duration of gravistimulation will estimate the amount of time required to saturate the gravitropic signal. The direction of clinorotation, e.g., rotation around the longitudinal axis or an axis perpendicular to the root growth direction has been shown to affect the stress level32 and therefore can be used to distinguish stimulation of receptors in lateral columella cell regions from domain characteristic for apical and basal wall regions. We attempt to provide insight in the memory capacity of the root gravisensing system of flax seedlings as a function of angular velocity over one order of magnitude (one octave) while remaining below the threshold level of gravisensitivity (10−3 g equivalents33–35) as a result of centrifugal forces. The results indicate a pronounced effect of the direction of clinorotation on response to but not memory of the stimulus.Results Growth rates. The average growth rate of vertically grown, nonclinorotated roots (controls) was 0.81 ± 0.03 mm h−1. The speed of clinorotation did not affect growth of horizontally clinorotated roots but growth rates of vertically clinorotated roots were 7% lower than controls or horizontally clinorotated roots (Table 1). The R2 value (typically >0.99) indicates high linearity of root growth regardless of the type of clinorotation and demonstrates that no changes in root growth occurred in response to gravistimulation or the speed of clinorotation. Table 1. Growth rates (mm h−1) of flax Roots clinorotated vertically and horizontally Open in a new tabEffect of reorientation time. Although control roots did not show consistent curvature, they exhibited some random tip movements. The deviation from the straight trajectory measured between 0° and 4° (Fig. 1A–E). This value was set as a threshold value to differentiate true curvature (exceeding the threshold value) from nutation (random movements, typically less than 4 degrees). The maximum extent of curvature increased with the stimulation time and ranged between 5° and 7° (Fig. 1F–J) for 5 min stimulation, between 3° and 10° (Fig. 1K–O) for 10 min of reorientation and between 5° to 10° (Fig. 1P–T) after 15 min of reorientation. Time of reorientation significantly enhanced the extent of curvature (p < 0.05). Although the extent of curvature increased with duration of reorientation, there was no significant difference in the extent of curvature after 10 min (Fig. 1K–O) and 15 min (Fig. 1P–T). Therefore, we consider the gravity signal saturated after 10 min of reorientation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Curvature profile of 6 h horizontally (solid lines) and vertically (dashed lines) clinorotated, 32 h old flax roots. The columns represent the time of reorientation before the onset of clinorotation; rows represent the speed of clinorotation. Curvature (in degrees) is shown as the running average (n = 3) of degrees ± standard error, n = 15.Direction of rotation. Horizontally clinorotated roots curved significantly stronger than vertically clinorotated roots (F(1,598) = 8.35, p = 0.004), Figure 1F–T. Vertically clinorotated roots showed no difference between 5, 10 or 15 min reorientation.Angular velocity. Curvature in horizontally clinorotated roots increased in response to increasing speed of rotation but decreased in vertically clinorotated roots (Fig. 1F–T). Angular velocity significantly affected the extent of curvature of clinorotated roots regardless of direction of clinorotation (F(4,295) = 6.83, p < 0.001). In vertically rotated roots, the difference in curvature between 5 rpm and all other angular velocities was significant. Similarly, horizontally clinorotated roots were affected by the rate of rotation (F(4,295) = 5.693, p < 0.001) and the roots curved maximally at 5 rpm (Fig. 1).Signal persistence. To determine the time for which a signal remains effective, the time course of curvature holds important clues. As long as a signal generates enhanced curvature i.e., the slope of the graphs in Figure 1 is positive, the signal must persist. Therefore, the time of maximum curvature was used as measure for signal persistence. The maximum root curvature was obtained within 2 h regardless of reorientation time or rotational speed. Thus, the gravitropic signal persisted at least for 2 h. Despite the general consistency of maximal curvature, variations on other parameters were observed. Reorientation for 5 min and 0.5 rpm clinorotation did not produce curvature (Fig. 1F); at 1, 2, 3 rpm curvature occurred within 10 min of clinorotation and maximum curvature varied with the speed and direction of rotation. Following maximum curvature, the curvature angle decreased and by the end of 240 to 300 min roots began to straighten at a rate similar to the rate of curvature (Fig. 1G–J). Ten minute reoriented roots began to curve within 10 to 20 min of clinorotation and maximum curvature varied with speed and direction of rotation. After 300 min of clinorotation, the roots began to straighten regardless of time of reorientation, angular velocity or direction of clinorotation. During the observation period of 6 h, straightening was not followed by any type of overcompensation and also indicates that curvature did not arise spontaneously or autonomously. Therefore, signal persistence is limited to the observed maximum of curvature.Discussion The data indicate that the reorientation stimulus led to increasing curvature for about 2 h regardless of the magnitude (duration) of the stimulation and the speed of clinorotation. The 2-h time frame therefore represents a type of memory that pertains to the retention of a physiological stimulus. Despite the persistence of the signal, the magnitude of the response was affected by the type and speed of clinorotation. Because clinorotation affects intracellular distribution of organelles, in particular amyloplasts, it is justified to state that mechanostimulation modifies the strength of the curvature response. A similar conclusion was derived from other measurements, where mechanostimulation was shown to amplify the graviresponse.44 However, in these experiments mechanostimulation was provided by oscillating seedlings prior to gravistimulation. Interestingly, the oscillatory enhancement had a half-time of 20 min.44 The difference between the longevity of the two types of stimulation indicates that the gravisensing mechanism is capable of integrating different mechanostimuli. Because the reorientation stimulus lasted for about 2 h, additional stimuli that occur during this time span are likely to become integrated into previous signal transduction and response events and may not have independent effects. This notion and the observation that different angular velocities during clinorotation affect the magnitude of the response, suggests that the understanding of clinorotation as a gravi-compensator (constantly changing the gravity vector) or a stimulus (rotation) that has to be faster than the response time is insufficient. The demonstrated effect of the rotational velocity on the magnitude of the response further suggests that the classic approach of using clinorotation to determine presentation times,34 gravisensitivity3 or lag times36 is too simplistic. The difference between vertical and horizontal clinorotation was not the result of (adaptive) changes in growth rates. The root growth rate was linear (Table 1), regardless of the rate of rotation. The growth rate in horizontally clinorotated roots was equal to that of vertically-grown, non-reoriented roots. In contrast, vertical clinorotation reduced the growth rate. These results suggest that mass-shifting parallel to the root axis inhibits growth while lateral stimulation does not reduce growth. The difference may be attributable to different sensitivities of lateral membranes compared to upper and lower cell membranes in gravi- or mass sensitive (columella) cells. However, the difference may also pertain to cells in the elongation zone; vertical clinorotation may release more auxin than horizontal clinorotation. Auxin and ethylene are potent root growth inhibitors,37 and likely related to clinorotation-induced growth changes; additional experiments will be required to identify to what extent the distribution of these hormones are affected by clinorotation. The curvature profile of non-gravistimulated roots fluctuated near the plumb line (0°), and demonstrates that clinorotation itself did not induce curvature and that clinorotation did not enhance or cause fluctuations. Reorientation intervals of 5, 10 and 15 min were chosen because they were longer than the presentation time38,39 but less than the time necessary to complete curvature. Although direction and speed of clinorotation significantly affected curvature (Fig. 1), the extent of curvature did not increase after 10 min of reorientation. The maximal response after 10 min reorientation coincides with the time course of statolith sedimentation to the new lower cell wall in Arabidopsis statocytes.40 Although flax and Arabidopsis may have similar sedimentation kinetics, the saturation of the graviresponse after 10 min is also supported by our observation of maximal curvature after 10 min reorientation. Investigations with excess starch mutants indicate that gravisensing is not saturated41 and studies of the presentation time show that much shorter reorientation times than signal saturation are sufficient to induce curvature and suggest that amyloplast sedimentation is not necessary for the initiation of gravitropism.40 While earlier studies focused on the detection limit (presentation time) that is sufficient to induce curvature,28,35 this study demonstrates saturation of the gravity stimulus likely coincides with the amyloplast sedimentation. Studies on gravity-induced gene expression, hormone redistribution and signal transduction should use this time as reference point for maximal effects of a (single) acceleration or reorientation stimulus. Several studies reported effects of horizontal clinorotation on gravicurvature.3,42 Cress roots that were clinorotated vertically for 6 h showed auto-straightening,42 similar to our data (Fig. 1). Auto-straightening may result from diminishing signal persistence (lack of a lateral signal) or represent the tendency of growing structures to follow a straight trajectory. The onset of auto straightening (end of signal persistence) thus may depend at least to some extent on age, growth and meristematic activity42 but not necessarily on auxin gradients.43 Thus the memory of the gravity signal weakens as the tissue ages and the auxin signal diminishes. The stronger auto-straightening in vertically clinorotated roots in combination with the reduced growth rate and reduced curvature indicates that vertical clinorotation inhibits the formation of lateral auxin gradients or facilitates the uniform redistribution of growth regulators more than horizontal clinorotation. Amplification of curvature by faster horizontal clinorotation (Fig. 1) corresponds to an earlier report, which showed that mechanostimulation at 5 Hz enhanced graviresponse44 and is in line with theoretical calculations that implicate the cytoskeleton in force-transduction events.45 Five Hertz corresponds to 300 rpm, a velocity that would exceed the threshold centrifugal forces (<0.0005 g, reviewed in ref. 33–35) for the thickness of a root (radius ∼0.2 mm), and even for a typical single cell (∼10 µm diameter). However, stronger curvature after faster rotation (e.g., 5 rpm) suggests that rotation affects the extent of curvature; the radius of our experimental setup (20 mm) was below the threshold of centrifugal forces (<0.0005 g). So far no reports exist on the effects of different rotational speed; additional experimentation may show that angular speed slower than 1 rpm may dampen graviresponsiveness even more than shown in this report. Thus, the rate of clinorotation affects the assessment of the gravitropic system in plants. The dependency of curvature on angular velocity suggests that presentation times may depend on the rate of clinorotation. The ability to perceive and store/retain the gravity signal for an extended time represents a type of memory. However, the response is short-lived (∼2 h) and clearly different from neurological bases of memory in animals. If signal saturation requires 10 min, the total retention time of the stimulus amounts to the duration of maximum curvature minus the stimulation time; i.e., if maximum curvature is achieved at 120 min, the signal persistence amounts to 110 min. The key factors involved in this plant memory may be the velocity at which auxin (sometimes likened to a neurotransmitter),46 is redistributed and equilibrates among the differentially elongating tissues. The signal persistence of about 2 h coincides with the reported pattern of auxin flow that includes auxin redistribution and movement from the cap to the elongation zone.46 Since asymmetric auxin flow is dependent on the relocalization of PIN proteins, it is possible that the “memory” is related to the stability of PIN relocalization. PIN 3, which is located in the columella cells, re-localized within 2 min from the basal side to the lateral side of the columella.47 PIN3 proteins likely determine the initial direction of auxin flow within the root cap47,48 and PIN 2 facilitates auxin flow from the columella to the elongation zone.49,50 Another factor that could affect signal persistence is the actin cytoskeleton. Although actin is not involved in the initial perception,51 it may downregulate uneven auxin distribution or contribute to ion channel activation.52 Further work is needed to assess the time and extent of PIN relocalization as a function of angular velocity.Materials and Methods Plant material and experimental procedure. Flax (Linum usitatissimum) seeds were soaked in distilled water for 10 min. Eight seeds were aligned along the edge of germination paper (36 x 16 mm), such that the micropyle was oriented perpendicular to the long side and pointing away from the paper. The seeds adhered to the paper because of the mucilage produced during soaking. The paper strips were allowed to dry completely and then placed on a piece of foam (40 x 12 mm) that was glued to a square plastic Petri dish (9 x 9 cm). After soaking foam and additional paper that lined the surface of the dish with deionized water, the dish was covered and the seeds germinated in a vertical position at 28°C in darkness.Gravistimulation and clinorotation. After 24 h, the Petri dishes were rotated such that the roots were horizontally positioned for 5, 10 or 15 min. After reorientation (gravistimulation), the Petri dish was immediately clinorotated either horizontally (the longitudinal axis of the roots remained perpendicular to the gravity vector) or vertically (the seedlings were reoriented back vertically). Controls were grown vertically under identical conditions without clinorotation. Clinorotation was performed using a computer-controlled stepper motor (Hurst PAS3206-004) at speeds of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 rpm for 6 h.Video imaging and analysis. Images of the dishes were taken after each rotation under infrared LED illumination (λmax 850 nm) with a CCTV Camera (Model Panasonic WV-BP334) fitted with zoom lens 12.5∼75 mm (Sony, Model No. 778057, Japan) and analyzed at 5 min intervals (Image J, v. 1.39 u) for angles between the basal portion of the root and the curving tip. Root length was measured in 10 min intervals and the growth rate expressed as mm h−1.Statistics. Three Petri dishes were examined for each experimental condition; 15 out of 24 seedlings were analyzed. The data were statistically examined using SAS (GLM, SAS version 9.1) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons.Conclusion Angular velocity and direction interfere with the graviresponse mechanism in roots. Independent of velocity and direction of clinorotation, the gravity signal persisted for 2 h and 10 min of reorientation sufficed to saturate the gravitropic signal. Future studies will investigate to what extent this phenomenon depends on auxin distribution, cytoskeletal network, metabolism, other signaling molecules or changes in gene activation. Differences in curvature after vertical and horizontal clinorotation offer the opportunity to identify structures or processes that distinguish the direction of clinorotation and contribute to the magnitude of differential elongation.Acknowledgments This work was supported by a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to KHH (grant # NNX10AP91G).References 1.Sack FD.

    "abstract": "Abstract The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Salinity with a high sodium chloride concentration (≥40 mM) in soil or irrigation water is the main concern worldwide in the context of rapid climatic changes due to its impact on nearly 20% of the world's total agricultural land, and the economics of crop production [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Simultaneously, the requirement to feed 9.3 billion people by 2050 is driving agricultural output into marginal regions, necessitating a significant advancement in the development of saline-tolerant crops [5,6]. The most susceptible stages to salinity are seed germination and seed establishment. Salinity triggers adverse changes in biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes in the growing seeds [7,8]. Reduced water availability, ionic imbalance, the altered release of reserve nutrients, and changes in protein structural organization are some of the few consequences of salinity on seed germination [9,10]. Besides, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative damage to protein and lipids, DNA and RNA breakage, cell leakage, damage to cell membranes and organelles, loss of photosynthetic components, and cell death [11,12]. Seed priming is an age-old technique that has been proven to be an inexpensive, efficient, practical, and safe pre-sowing approach to combat the salinity-induced growth and developmental limitation of plants and to promote cost-effective and sustainable crop production on salt-affected soil [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Seed priming has been shown to be beneficial by promoting seed germination parameters, facilitating seedling development with an enhanced vigour, and boosting water and minerals uptake, under various abiotic stress conditions such as drought [18], chilling [19], salinity [20], heat [21,22], and heavy metals [23,24], etc. There are various approaches to seed priming such as hydropriming, halopriming, osmopriming, hormoprimimg, biopriming, thermopriming, and solid matrix priming [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. The consequences of priming are influenced by the priming agent, the duration of priming, and the dosage of priming agents [31]. There are several reports that water [[32], [33], [34]], sodium chloride [[35], [36], [37], [38], [39]], thiourea [40], proline [41], and polyethylene glycol [42,43] have been proven to be efficient priming agents for improving germination, seedling establishment, vigour, and tolerance under salinity stress. However, a large percentage of these findings are focused on germination parameters of model crops and cereals such as Arabidopsis, chili, tomato, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, etc. Brassica oleracea L. represents a popular cash crop and the second most economical cooked vegetable after potato of the family Brassicaceae. It is recognised as the chief nutrient-rich crop, including a broad variety of phytochemicals with health-promoting qualities such as antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and tocopherols and some clinically important sulfur containing metabolites, i.e. cynidine, glucosinolates, siringin, etc. [44,45]. Therefore, ingestion of these cruciferous veggies has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular [46,47] and neurological diseases [48], type 2 diabetes [49], and malignancies such as colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers [[50], [51], [52], [53]]. As a result, Brassica oleracea L. crops, such as broccoli (var. italica), cabbage (var. capitata), cauliflower (var. botrytis), brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera) and kale (var. acephala) are classified as functional foods and considered as “Super Veggies” [54]. On an annual basis, 20 metric tonnes of cauliflower and broccoli are grown on 1.6 thousand acres throughout the world. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) of the United Nations, China and India are the world's largest producers, generating 1.42 million ha area having the annual production of 26.90 million tonnes per year, accounting for 74% of global production (FAO, 2019) [55,56]. However, these varieties sternly challenged by saline circumstances lead to a reduction in crop growth. Among the B. oleracea varieties, Cauliflower (B. oleracea L. var. botrytis) is generally considered moderately salt tolerant [57]. India produces around 13% of global vegetable output and ranks first in cauliflower [58], but as soil salinity rises, crop production and economic outputs may begin to fall. Many B. oleracea crops are now struggling with the effects of salt and other abiotic stressors as a result of intensive field usage of different fertilizers and the fast expansion of protected farming land [59,60]. However, scar attempts have been made to combat and ameliorate the possible adverse salt stress influence in cauliflower. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming agents on the seed germination indices, seedling performance, and physio-biochemical attributes of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) subjected to high salt stress by computing the correlation coefficient and principal components.",

Significantly lower seed germination metrics were observed in the salt-stressed non-primed cauliflower seeds (NPS) than in the non-stressed non-primed (NPN) seeds. A decline in germination potential (29.17%), germination rate (30.72%), germination index (42.88%), vigour index (70.59%), shoot length (33.9%), root length (68.64%), shoot fresh weight (43.01%), root fresh weight (50.3%), shoot dry weight (46.75%), and root dry weight (51.0%) was observed in NPS compared to NPN (Table 1).

Effect of different seed priming treatments on germination metrics under salinity stress The germination attributes varied with different priming treatments, viz. hydropriming, halopriming, etc. under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). All the germination features were greater in the hydropriming group than in the non-primed control, excluding RSDW (Table 2). The majority of germination matrices were better in the TU and proline groups than the halopriming with 100 mM NaCl. Seed priming with PEG increased all germination parameters, and the relative values of most features, including RVI, RSL, RRFW, RRDW, and others, were higher in the PEG treatments than in the other treatments (Table 2).

The correlation coefficient among germination parameters The correlation coefficient analysis for different germination parameters depicted two distinct groupings with closely related characteristics (Fig. 3). RGP, RGR, RGI, and RVI belonged to one group, whereas RSFW, RRFW, RSDW, RRDW, RSL, and RRL, belonged to the other group with closely related features. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. The RGP was substantially linked with RVI, RRL, and RSL with correlation values of 0.72, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively. The RGI showed a correlation with RSL and RVI with correlation values of 0.63 and 0.81, respectively. A significant correlation was also found between RSL and RSDW having correlation values of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. Fig. 3.

Principal component analysis The influence of several priming agents on B. oleracea L. var. botrytis germination characteristics under salt stress was studied using principal component analysis (PCA). The components PC1 and PC2 explained 61.18% and 15.78% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 4). The major impacts of different priming agents on germination traits were precisely scattered on the PC1 axis in the pattern of 20% PEG > 10% PEG> 3 mM TU> 5 mM TU> 30% PEG> 10 mM Proline> 50 mM NaCl> 20 mM Proline> 25 mM NaCl> 5 mM Proline> 1 mM TU> HP> 100 mM NaCl. The PEG treatments had greater PC1 scores and were clustered on the right side of the PC1 axis, meanwhile, the lower scoring treatments were majorly on the left. PCA revealed increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. Fig. 4.

PC1 demonstrated substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes. PC2 exhibited significant positive relationships with growth indices, but negative associations were observed in terms of RGP, RGR, RVI, and RGI. This means that PC1 indicated all germination but PC2 showed the inverse correlations between RGR, RGP, RGI, RVI, and other growth indices. Table 3. Loading matrix for principal components.

Cluster analysis According to Ward's approach of systematic categorization, the 13 distinct priming treatments were classified into three groups in cluster analysis (Fig. 5). The 1 mM TU, HP, and 100 mM NaCl treatments were in the first group, and they had a smaller effect on seed germination under salt stress than the other treatments. The 20% PEG and 30% PEG treatments were in the second group, and they had the best effect on seed germination in salty circumstances. The third group, which included the 5 mM proline, 20 mM proline, 10 mM Proline, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM TU, 3 mM TU, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% PEG treatments, showed increased germination traits under salinity stress conditions, relatively to a lower extent. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Dendrogram of seed priming treatments based on Y-values using Ward's method of systematic classification. 3.6. Effect of priming on protein, proline, and MDA content Priming has a significant impact on protein, proline, and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings (Fig. 6). The salinity stress gradually reduced the protein content with increasing salt concentration compared to the control. Among the different priming agents, TU showed a greater effect on increasing protein content (19.52%) in seedlings grown under salt stress than the control compared to all other priming treatments (Fig. 6B). It was observed that the proline content was increased in all priming treatments compared to unprimed seedlings. Seedlings growing only in salt conditions without a primer reduced protein content by 36.35% than control in comparison to all other treatments. Seedlings primed with proline have the proline content increased 2 to 3-fold in all primed treatment in compared to control has the lowest proline content (Fig. 6C). Priming has been shown to be an effective method to mitigate the stress-induced formation of MDA and reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation indicated by MDA content was differentially reduced in a dose-dependent and priming agent-specific manner by application of the priming treatment compared to stressed seedlings (Fig. 6A). As a result, cauliflower seedlings derived from prepared seeds had greatly reduced MDA levels under salt stress conditions (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Effects of seed priming under salt stress in Cauliflower seedlings. At 10 days post-incubation, non-primed no stress (NPN), no priming with salt stress (NPS), and primed with different priming agents under salt stress seedlings were harvested and analysed for MDA, proline, and soluble protein content.

Different low case letters above the bars indicate significant statistical differences between the treatments (p < 0.05). 3.7. Photosynthetic pigments and DAB staining It has been observed that chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments are susceptible to salinity stress (Fig. 7). The primed B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings showed a much-reduced rate of photosynthetic pigments degradation under saline conditions in comparison to non-primed seedlings. Seed priming with different priming agents, viz. proline, PEG, TU, NaCl, and H2O remarkably improved the chl a, chl b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid content in B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner. The Chl a, Chl b, and total chlorophyll were increased at 1.95 fold, 3.38 fold and 2.15 fold in Pro 10 mM, Pro 20 mM, and Pro 10 mM, respectively while carotenoidswere highly increased (2 fold) on 20 mM PEG compared to all treatments. The DAB staining results showed that unprimed leaves exhibited a distinct brown stain after treatment with a higher salinity (100 mM), indicating greater ROS accumulation compared to primed leaves (Fig. 8). Overall, salt stress, which produced large amounts of peroxide radicals, alleviated, while all plants treated with priming agents mitigated the effects of the stress by preventing peroxide radical production.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Salt stress can easily stunt Brassica growth, especially during germination. In this study, salt stress greatly reduced cauliflower germination as evidenced by reductions in germination potential, germination rate, germination index, and vigor index, and inhibition of seedling development. Under salt stress, seed germination can be suppressed or delayed for a variety of reasons. First, salinity significantly slows seedling growth and affects typical morphologies throughout the seedling stage by disrupting a number of vital fundamental cellular processes that alter the rate of emergence and growth, particularly in glycophytes [66]. Second, salt stress has been linked to ion toxicity and osmotic stress in cellular metabolic processes, resulting in lower turgor pressure due to increased negative water potential, both of which affect growth traits such as shoot root length, plant vigor, seedling growth, and biomass [[67], [68], [69], [70]]. Therefore, the main consequence of salt stress is a reduction in the cell division process, resulting in reduced development of the internodes, contributing to reduced growth and elongation of shoots, reduced leaf elongation, and rapid cell death [1,[71], [72], [73]]. Increasing salt tolerance and using appropriate management techniques to counteract the negative effects of salinity on salt-sensitive species is one of the most important and difficult management tasks [74]. Therefore, seed priming is the effective and ancient method to reduce the negative effects of various abiotic stresses [[75], [76], [77]]. Various priming techniques have been applied to seeds of many crops to help them overcome growth barriers and establish themselves more successfully in harsh climatic conditions [[78], [79], [80], [81], [82]]. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization [83], increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings [84]. So pre-treating seeds with chemical agents, which create a moderate stress-like signal, permits the establishment of a “priming memory,” that improves tolerance when the plant is subjected to various abiotic stress in the future [85,86]. In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the effects of different priming techniques such as hydro-, halo- and osmopriming using appropriate priming agents such as water, NaCl, proline, PEG and TU on B. oleracea under salt stress and the results showed that all priming agents tested enhanced the germination indices of cauliflower seeds under salt stress over the unprimed group (Table 2). All priming techniques proved beneficial to improve germination indices and growth parameters, i.e., GP, GR, SVI, RL, SL, SDW and RDW significantly in B. oleracea under salinity regime (Table 2). Salt stress increases ROS production by causing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, leading to disruption of biochemical and physiochemical activities [[87], [88], [89], [90]]. MDA level is a lipid peroxidation indicator that is more visible in salt sensitive plants compared to salt tolerant plants and can be used to determine the extent of oxidative damage, membrane rupture, DNA damage and cell death [91,92]. In the present study, the results showed that MDA levels were increased over control in non-primed cauliflower seedlings (NPS) grown under salt stress (Fig. 6A). All tested priming treatments were found beneficial to counteract the salinity stress responses differentially with respect to MDA content (Fig. 6A). In cauliflower seedlings treated with halo-priming (NaCl-priming), MDA content increased steadily with increasing NaCl-priming concentrations (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in osmoprimed (PEG-primed) seedlings, MDA content was gradually reduced with an increase in PEG levels. Thiourea and proline priming reduced MDA content in a dose-specific manner and was effective over hydro-priming alone (Fig. 6A). Similar results have been observed in previous findings showing that MDA concentrations decrease in certain radish cultivars while increasing in others under saline conditions [[93], [94], [95]]. However, in the control seedling, a lower level of MDA was observed with no primer and no salt stress (NPN) treatment. Thus, the present results showed that the MDA content of seedlings sprout from prepared seeds decreased significantly, indicating that these seedlings were better protected against salt stress. Ibrahim (2016) examined the benefits of seed priming in combating salt-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibition of MDA build-up (Ibrahim, 2016). MDA formation in prepared seedlings is hampered by the activation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, as evidenced by maize research [96]. The first organelle to be altered by salt stress is the cell membrane, since polyunsaturated fatty acids are one of the membrane lipid components most susceptible to peroxidation during times of stress. Increased membrane permeability causes lipid peroxidation, which compromises membrane integrity [97]. Among the organic solutes, proline has been shown to maintain cellular osmotic potential, stabilize membranes, and detoxify toxic ions in salt-stressed plants [[98], [99], [100], [101]]. The accumulation of proline in salt-stressed plants was therefore considered as a predictive factor for salt tolerance. In the current study, the proline content in the untreated salt stress (NPS) control is higher than in the no-prime and no-stress (NPN) treatment control, but significantly lower than in primed treatments (Fig. 6C). All priming treatments on cauliflower seeds significantly improved proline accumulation with increasing concentration of the respective priming agents in the cauliflower seedlings grown under the salt stress regime (Fig. 6C). However, halopriming (NaCl priming) and proline priming proved very beneficial in terms of proline accumulation among all attempted priming treatments. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU (Fig. 6C). The current results showed that proline concentrations in cabbage increased with increasing salinity, consistent with previous results in salt-sensitive Napa cabbages [102]. It has been suggested that proline amino acid aggregation occurs more frequently than other amino acids in stressful environments and may be a factor in osmotic management and regulation of plant enzyme activity [103,104]. Accumulation of proline amino acids protects plant tissues from stress by acting as a fixative enzyme that reduces lipid peroxidation by improving membrane integrity and reducing cell membrane breakdown [[105], [106], [107], [108]]. In the current studies, the results showed that the non-primed control seedlings with no salt stress (NPN) were high in protein, while the non-primed control seedlings grown under salt stress (NPS) were lower in protein (Fig. 6B). When halo-primed (NaCl treatment), the protein content increased with increasing NaCl concentration from 25 mM NaCl to 50 mM NaCl and decreased when priming with 100 mM NaCl. When osmoprimed with proline and PEG, the protein content increased with increasing concentration of the priming agent. Higher concentrations of both priming agents, PEG and thiourea, showed the highest total soluble protein content in cauliflower seedlings grown under salt stress. However, water-primed seeds also slightly increased protein content, but the overall gain was much higher in the case of halo, TU, PEG, and proline priming (Fig. 6B). The growth of the free amino acid pool due to hydrolysis of protein during the osmotic adjustment process may account for the increase in total soluble protein under salt stress. Seed priming enhanced accumulation of all soluble proteins under a variety of abiotic stressors [[109], [110], [111], [112]]. Future research should address the mechanism by which seed preparation increases total protein content. In the present study, a reduction in Chl a, Chl b and total Chl was observed in the unprimed salt stressed (NPS) control, however, high chlorophyll content was found in the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control (Fig. 7). Interestingly, all priming approaches mitigated the deleterious effects of salinity on chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, and significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 7A–D). Proline priming proved to be much more beneficial for enhancing photosynthetic pigments than hydropriming alone. Halopriming was the least effective for pigment enhancement compared to other priming approaches in cauliflower. Salinity has a significant impact on all developmental traits. However, different treatments showed different responses to salinity sensitivity. Fig. 7 showed that the hydroprimed and NaCl pre-treated seedlings had no significant difference in Chl b but increased Chl a and total Chl in the NaCl pre-treated seedlings. The amount of photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves is affected by increased concentrations of Na+ and Cl− [113,114]. However, it has been discovered that as salinity increases, chlorophyll levels decrease. Salinity stress causes a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, which could be due to its negative effects on membrane integrity, decreased biosynthesis, or rapid pigment degradation [115,116]. It has also been observed that the long-term effects of salt cause the development of chlorophyll-protein-lipid complexes to be disrupted [117]. In the present study, seed primed with Pro, PEG and TU significantly increased total chlorophyll compared to hydropriming in salt stress (Fig. 7C). In the current investigation, proline priming significantly increased chlorophyll content, and proline treatment was also reported to favourably affect Chl a and total chlorophyll content in salt-stressed S. bicolor [118].",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusion and future prospective The results of the present study showed that different sustainable eco-friendly, cost-effective, and user-friendly seed priming strategies, such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming, proved beneficial for improved germination indices and other morphophysiological traits under the regime of salt stress in Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis. The results were essentially related to proline accumulation in prepared cauliflower seedlings, which lowered MDA levels and alleviated lipid peroxidation (membrane damage) with increased total soluble protein and photosynthetic pigments on seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl. The present results imply that various priming agents such as water, NaCl, PEG, proline, and thiourea proved effective to accelerate the germination rate, synchronized growth, and metabolite activation under the high NaCl level. In summary, simple and affordable priming treatments such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming can be used to improve the performance of cauliflower crops. However, additional research on the beneficial effect of priming approaches will support the scalability of sustainable production and increased crop outputs, boosted crop quality and quantity, establishment, and reduction of salt damage in order to meet food demand, particularly on agricultural land under a variety of favorable and stressful conditions, as this is a priority of modern agricultural research. The information gained would also support molecular breeding research to develop cauliflower varieties that are more resistant to salt stress. Understanding the processes that promote salt stress tolerance can aid in the development of strategies to achieve sustainable crop yields under these adverse conditions.",

Copyright notice ID: 10025027 PMID: 36950655 Abstract The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.

Introduction Salinity with a high sodium chloride concentration (≥40 mM) in soil or irrigation water is the main concern worldwide in the context of rapid climatic changes due to its impact on nearly 20% of the world's total agricultural land, and the economics of crop production [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Simultaneously, the requirement to feed 9.3 billion people by 2050 is driving agricultural output into marginal regions, necessitating a significant advancement in the development of saline-tolerant crops [5,6]. The most susceptible stages to salinity are seed germination and seed establishment. Salinity triggers adverse changes in biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes in the growing seeds [7,8]. Reduced water availability, ionic imbalance, the altered release of reserve nutrients, and changes in protein structural organization are some of the few consequences of salinity on seed germination [9,10]. Besides, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative damage to protein and lipids, DNA and RNA breakage, cell leakage, damage to cell membranes and organelles, loss of photosynthetic components, and cell death [11,12]. Seed priming is an age-old technique that has been proven to be an inexpensive, efficient, practical, and safe pre-sowing approach to combat the salinity-induced growth and developmental limitation of plants and to promote cost-effective and sustainable crop production on salt-affected soil [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Seed priming has been shown to be beneficial by promoting seed germination parameters, facilitating seedling development with an enhanced vigour, and boosting water and minerals uptake, under various abiotic stress conditions such as drought [18], chilling [19], salinity [20], heat [21,22], and heavy metals [23,24], etc. There are various approaches to seed priming such as hydropriming, halopriming, osmopriming, hormoprimimg, biopriming, thermopriming, and solid matrix priming [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. The consequences of priming are influenced by the priming agent, the duration of priming, and the dosage of priming agents [31]. There are several reports that water [[32], [33], [34]], sodium chloride [[35], [36], [37], [38], [39]], thiourea [40], proline [41], and polyethylene glycol [42,43] have been proven to be efficient priming agents for improving germination, seedling establishment, vigour, and tolerance under salinity stress. However, a large percentage of these findings are focused on germination parameters of model crops and cereals such as Arabidopsis, chili, tomato, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, etc. Brassica oleracea L. represents a popular cash crop and the second most economical cooked vegetable after potato of the family Brassicaceae. It is recognised as the chief nutrient-rich crop, including a broad variety of phytochemicals with health-promoting qualities such as antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and tocopherols and some clinically important sulfur containing metabolites, i.e. cynidine, glucosinolates, siringin, etc. [44,45]. Therefore, ingestion of these cruciferous veggies has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular [46,47] and neurological diseases [48], type 2 diabetes [49], and malignancies such as colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers [[50], [51], [52], [53]]. As a result, Brassica oleracea L. crops, such as broccoli (var. italica), cabbage (var. capitata), cauliflower (var. botrytis), brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera) and kale (var. acephala) are classified as functional foods and considered as “Super Veggies” [54]. On an annual basis, 20 metric tonnes of cauliflower and broccoli are grown on 1.6 thousand acres throughout the world. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) of the United Nations, China and India are the world's largest producers, generating 1.42 million ha area having the annual production of 26.90 million tonnes per year, accounting for 74% of global production (FAO, 2019) [55,56]. However, these varieties sternly challenged by saline circumstances lead to a reduction in crop growth. Among the B. oleracea varieties, Cauliflower (B. oleracea L. var. botrytis) is generally considered moderately salt tolerant [57]. India produces around 13% of global vegetable output and ranks first in cauliflower [58], but as soil salinity rises, crop production and economic outputs may begin to fall. Many B. oleracea crops are now struggling with the effects of salt and other abiotic stressors as a result of intensive field usage of different fertilizers and the fast expansion of protected farming land [59,60]. However, scar attempts have been made to combat and ameliorate the possible adverse salt stress influence in cauliflower. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming agents on the seed germination indices, seedling performance, and physio-biochemical attributes of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) subjected to high salt stress by computing the correlation coefficient and principal components.2. Materials and methodology 2.1. Plant material Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) seeds were purchased from a local market in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. This is a herbaceous annual vegetable plant that grows in the cool season with an average daily temperature of 15–20 °C.2.2. Priming treatments The homogeneous cauliflower seeds were disinfected with 1% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) solution containing 0.2% Tween-20 for 10 min and washed five times with sterilized distilled water to remove the disinfectant. The sterilized seeds were blotted and completely dried on a cellulose pad at 25 °C. To prime the seeds, they were hydroprimed [distilled water (H2O)], haloprimed [sodium chloride (NaCl)], and osmoprimed [thiourea (TU)]. polyethylene glycol (PEG) and proline (Pro)] by immersion at 18–22 °C for 12 h in the dark with continuous gentle stirring. The seed to solution ratio was 1:5 (w/v) (g/ml). After 12 h the seeds were then removed from the priming solution and rinsed thoroughly with sterilized water and dried again with forced air (using the oven drying method) for 24 h to achieve a moisture content closer to that of the pre-priming stage. The moisture content of the prepared seeds was reduced to 7% after 24 h of rapid drying at 20 °C. Unprimed seeds were used as controls and seeds were stored in sealed polythene bags. The experiments included the following treatments: (i)NPN (No priming no stress) (ii)NPS (No priming and salt stress) (iii)HP (Hydro-priming) (iv)Halopriming with 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM NaCl (v)Priming with TU (Thiourea) 1 mM, 3 mM, and 5 mM (vi)Priming with Pro (Proline) 5 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM (vii)Priming with PEG (Polyethylene glycol) 10%, 20%, and 30% 2.3. Experimental design The experiment was setup in a complete randomized design (CRD), with five replicates of each treatment with 10 seeds per plate. Primed and nonprimed seeds were placed in Petri dishes (90 × 120 mm) with double-layered sterile filter paper moistened with sterilized water, and germinated at 25 ± 2 °C for two days in a dark room. After 2 days, the Petri dishes were transferred to a climate-controlled chamber with a photoperiod of 16:8 (light/dark), 55% relative humidity, temperatures of 25 ± 2 °C, and 100 mM NaCl solution was added into each priming treated seeds except control. This NaCl concentration was determined based on the finding from preliminary experiments, which inhibited radicle length by approximately 50%. The salt stress was renewed every other day until the end of the experiment (10 days) to maintain the concentration of the treatment solution and the moisture of the filter papers was monitored every 24 h. Seed germination was recorded daily from the appearance of radicles even up to 2 mm. The schematic representation of the experimental setup for seed priming is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Schematic representation of seed priming.2.4. Growth parameters From each replicate, five seedlings were randomly selected after 10 days of germination to measure shoot and root length (SL and RL) with a standard ruler. Seedling fresh and dry weight, such as shoot fresh weight (SFW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), and root dry weight (RDW), were determined using analytical balances (Mettler- Toledo, India). The seedlings were dried in a hot air oven at a constant temperature of 72 °C for 48 h to estimate the dry weight. The following seedling metrics, such as germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR), vigor index (VI), and germination index (GI) were measured in 10-day-old seedlings as reported by Sun et al. (2012) [61] using the following formulas: GR=Totalnumberofgerminatedseedsonday10Totalnumberofseeds×100 (1) GP=Totalnumberofgerminatedseedsonday4Totalnumberofseeds×100 (2) GI = (number of seeds germinated on day 1/1) + (number of seeds germinated on day 2/2) + (number of seeds germinated on day 3/3) + … …. (number of seeds germinated on day 10/10) (3) VI = GI X R.F.W. (4) 2.5. Estimation of photosynthetic attributes The amount of chlorophyll in the plant samples was determined using the method described by Arnon (1949) [62]. Fresh leaves (100 mg) were grounded in 80% acetone (v/v) and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. The filtrate was used to quantify Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents at 663 nm, 646 nm, 750 nm, and 470 nm, respectively.2.6. Estimation of protein Protein analysis was performed using the coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) assay as described by Bradford (1976) [63]. The plant materials (1 gm) were gently homogenized in 0.1 M buffer solution (pH 7) using a pre-chilled pestle and mortar. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The filtrate was used to quantify protein content at 595 nm by UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1900i).2.7. Estimation of proline content The proline in plant samples was quantified spectrophotometrically at 520 nm using the method of Bates et al. (1973) [64]. The leaves (500 mg) of cauliflower seedlings were crushed in aq. sulfosalicylic acid (3%) and centrifugated at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. After that, an aliquot of the filtrate was combined with glacial acetic acid in the acidic ninhydrin reagent and incubated at constant temperature (100 °C) for 1 h followed by cooling in an ice bath to terminate the reaction. The toluene was added to the mixture and vortexed for 30 s on a cyclomixer to obtain the proline containing toluene chromophore and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer.2.8. Estimation of MDA content The quantity of malonaldehyde (MDA) in the seedlings was determined using the method of Heath and Packer (1968) [65]to detect membrane lipid peroxidation. 500 mg plant tissue from each sample was homogenized in TCA 20% with 0.5% TBA. The extract was then heated at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling on ice, the samples were centrifuged to clarify the solution. The spectrophotometric analysis of MDA was done by reading the absorbance at 532 nm and then at 600 nm to subtract the nonspecific absorption value. The MDA content was calculated using an extinction value of 155 mM−1 cm−1.2.9. Histochemical detections of H2O2 The leaves were incubated in 1 mg/ml DAB (3′3′- diaminobenzidine; pH 3.8) solution and kept at room temperature until a darker brown stain (produced by H2O2-DAB polymerization) appeared to visualize H2O2 deposition in the tissues. Prior to visualization, the leaves were immersed in a freshly prepared bleaching solution (ethanol: acetic acid: glycerol) and kept in a hot water bath for 15 min followed by incubation in fresh bleaching solution at room temp. for 30 min to bleach chlorophyll.2.10. Statistical analysis The statistical program SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) and all means within each variable were statistically determined using the Tukey HSD test at a probability level of 5%. The cluster analysis classifies all treatments according to their germination efficiency. OriginPro 2020 (OriginLab, Massachusetts, USA) was also used to create the heatmap and PCA to estimate the correlation coefficient between germination parameters.3. Results 3.1. Germination parameters in salinity stress conditions Salt stress had a major influence on seed germination in the absence of priming treatment. Significantly lower seed germination metrics were observed in the salt-stressed non-primed cauliflower seeds (NPS) than in the non-stressed non-primed (NPN) seeds. A decline in germination potential (29.17%), germination rate (30.72%), germination index (42.88%), vigour index (70.59%), shoot length (33.9%), root length (68.64%), shoot fresh weight (43.01%), root fresh weight (50.3%), shoot dry weight (46.75%), and root dry weight (51.0%) was observed in NPS compared to NPN (Table 1).

Different letters within a column indicate a significant difference at p < 0.05.3.2. Effect of different seed priming treatments on germination metrics under salinity stress The germination attributes varied with different priming treatments, viz. hydropriming, halopriming, etc. under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). All the germination features were greater in the hydropriming group than in the non-primed control, excluding RSDW (Table 2). The majority of germination matrices were better in the TU and proline groups than the halopriming with 100 mM NaCl. Seed priming with PEG increased all germination parameters, and the relative values of most features, including RVI, RSL, RRFW, RRDW, and others, were higher in the PEG treatments than in the other treatments (Table 2).

The correlation coefficient among germination parameters The correlation coefficient analysis for different germination parameters depicted two distinct groupings with closely related characteristics (Fig. 3). RGP, RGR, RGI, and RVI belonged to one group, whereas RSFW, RRFW, RSDW, RRDW, RSL, and RRL, belonged to the other group with closely related features. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. The RGP was substantially linked with RVI, RRL, and RSL with correlation values of 0.72, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively. The RGI showed a correlation with RSL and RVI with correlation values of 0.63 and 0.81, respectively. A significant correlation was also found between RSL and RSDW having correlation values of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. Fig. 3.

Principal component analysis The influence of several priming agents on B. oleracea L. var. botrytis germination characteristics under salt stress was studied using principal component analysis (PCA). The components PC1 and PC2 explained 61.18% and 15.78% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 4). The major impacts of different priming agents on germination traits were precisely scattered on the PC1 axis in the pattern of 20% PEG > 10% PEG> 3 mM TU> 5 mM TU> 30% PEG> 10 mM Proline> 50 mM NaCl> 20 mM Proline> 25 mM NaCl> 5 mM Proline> 1 mM TU> HP> 100 mM NaCl. The PEG treatments had greater PC1 scores and were clustered on the right side of the PC1 axis, meanwhile, the lower scoring treatments were majorly on the left. PCA revealed increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. Fig. 4.

Cluster analysis According to Ward's approach of systematic categorization, the 13 distinct priming treatments were classified into three groups in cluster analysis (Fig. 5). The 1 mM TU, HP, and 100 mM NaCl treatments were in the first group, and they had a smaller effect on seed germination under salt stress than the other treatments. The 20% PEG and 30% PEG treatments were in the second group, and they had the best effect on seed germination in salty circumstances. The third group, which included the 5 mM proline, 20 mM proline, 10 mM Proline, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM TU, 3 mM TU, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% PEG treatments, showed increased germination traits under salinity stress conditions, relatively to a lower extent.

Effect of priming on protein, proline, and MDA content Priming has a significant impact on protein, proline, and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings (Fig. 6). The salinity stress gradually reduced the protein content with increasing salt concentration compared to the control. Among the different priming agents, TU showed a greater effect on increasing protein content (19.52%) in seedlings grown under salt stress than the control compared to all other priming treatments (Fig. 6B). It was observed that the proline content was increased in all priming treatments compared to unprimed seedlings. Seedlings growing only in salt conditions without a primer reduced protein content by 36.35% than control in comparison to all other treatments. Seedlings primed with proline have the proline content increased 2 to 3-fold in all primed treatment in compared to control has the lowest proline content (Fig. 6C). Priming has been shown to be an effective method to mitigate the stress-induced formation of MDA and reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation indicated by MDA content was differentially reduced in a dose-dependent and priming agent-specific manner by application of the priming treatment compared to stressed seedlings (Fig. 6A). As a result, cauliflower seedlings derived from prepared seeds had greatly reduced MDA levels under salt stress conditions (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6.

At 10 days post-incubation, non-primed no stress (NPN), no priming with salt stress (NPS), and primed with different priming agents under salt stress seedlings were harvested and analysed for MDA, proline, and soluble protein content.

Photosynthetic pigments and DAB staining It has been observed that chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments are susceptible to salinity stress (Fig. 7). The primed B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings showed a much-reduced rate of photosynthetic pigments degradation under saline conditions in comparison to non-primed seedlings. Seed priming with different priming agents, viz. proline, PEG, TU, NaCl, and H2O remarkably improved the chl a, chl b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid content in B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner. The Chl a, Chl b, and total chlorophyll were increased at 1.95 fold, 3.38 fold and 2.15 fold in Pro 10 mM, Pro 20 mM, and Pro 10 mM, respectively while carotenoidswere highly increased (2 fold) on 20 mM PEG compared to all treatments. The DAB staining results showed that unprimed leaves exhibited a distinct brown stain after treatment with a higher salinity (100 mM), indicating greater ROS accumulation compared to primed leaves (Fig. 8). Overall, salt stress, which produced large amounts of peroxide radicals, alleviated, while all plants treated with priming agents mitigated the effects of the stress by preventing peroxide radical production.

In this study, salt stress greatly reduced cauliflower germination as evidenced by reductions in germination potential, germination rate, germination index, and vigor index, and inhibition of seedling development. Under salt stress, seed germination can be suppressed or delayed for a variety of reasons. First, salinity significantly slows seedling growth and affects typical morphologies throughout the seedling stage by disrupting a number of vital fundamental cellular processes that alter the rate of emergence and growth, particularly in glycophytes [66]. Second, salt stress has been linked to ion toxicity and osmotic stress in cellular metabolic processes, resulting in lower turgor pressure due to increased negative water potential, both of which affect growth traits such as shoot root length, plant vigor, seedling growth, and biomass [[67], [68], [69], [70]]. Therefore, the main consequence of salt stress is a reduction in the cell division process, resulting in reduced development of the internodes, contributing to reduced growth and elongation of shoots, reduced leaf elongation, and rapid cell death [1,[71], [72], [73]]. Increasing salt tolerance and using appropriate management techniques to counteract the negative effects of salinity on salt-sensitive species is one of the most important and difficult management tasks [74]. Therefore, seed priming is the effective and ancient method to reduce the negative effects of various abiotic stresses [[75], [76], [77]]. Various priming techniques have been applied to seeds of many crops to help them overcome growth barriers and establish themselves more successfully in harsh climatic conditions [[78], [79], [80], [81], [82]]. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization [83], increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings [84]. So pre-treating seeds with chemical agents, which create a moderate stress-like signal, permits the establishment of a “priming memory,” that improves tolerance when the plant is subjected to various abiotic stress in the future [85,86]. In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the effects of different priming techniques such as hydro-, halo- and osmopriming using appropriate priming agents such as water, NaCl, proline, PEG and TU on B. oleracea under salt stress and the results showed that all priming agents tested enhanced the germination indices of cauliflower seeds under salt stress over the unprimed group (Table 2). All priming techniques proved beneficial to improve germination indices and growth parameters, i.e., GP, GR, SVI, RL, SL, SDW and RDW significantly in B. oleracea under salinity regime (Table 2). Salt stress increases ROS production by causing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, leading to disruption of biochemical and physiochemical activities [[87], [88], [89], [90]]. MDA level is a lipid peroxidation indicator that is more visible in salt sensitive plants compared to salt tolerant plants and can be used to determine the extent of oxidative damage, membrane rupture, DNA damage and cell death [91,92]. In the present study, the results showed that MDA levels were increased over control in non-primed cauliflower seedlings (NPS) grown under salt stress (Fig. 6A). All tested priming treatments were found beneficial to counteract the salinity stress responses differentially with respect to MDA content (Fig. 6A). In cauliflower seedlings treated with halo-priming (NaCl-priming), MDA content increased steadily with increasing NaCl-priming concentrations (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in osmoprimed (PEG-primed) seedlings, MDA content was gradually reduced with an increase in PEG levels. Thiourea and proline priming reduced MDA content in a dose-specific manner and was effective over hydro-priming alone (Fig. 6A). Similar results have been observed in previous findings showing that MDA concentrations decrease in certain radish cultivars while increasing in others under saline conditions [[93], [94], [95]]. However, in the control seedling, a lower level of MDA was observed with no primer and no salt stress (NPN) treatment. Thus, the present results showed that the MDA content of seedlings sprout from prepared seeds decreased significantly, indicating that these seedlings were better protected against salt stress. Ibrahim (2016) examined the benefits of seed priming in combating salt-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibition of MDA build-up (Ibrahim, 2016). MDA formation in prepared seedlings is hampered by the activation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, as evidenced by maize research [96]. The first organelle to be altered by salt stress is the cell membrane, since polyunsaturated fatty acids are one of the membrane lipid components most susceptible to peroxidation during times of stress. Increased membrane permeability causes lipid peroxidation, which compromises membrane integrity [97]. Among the organic solutes, proline has been shown to maintain cellular osmotic potential, stabilize membranes, and detoxify toxic ions in salt-stressed plants [[98], [99], [100], [101]]. The accumulation of proline in salt-stressed plants was therefore considered as a predictive factor for salt tolerance. In the current study, the proline content in the untreated salt stress (NPS) control is higher than in the no-prime and no-stress (NPN) treatment control, but significantly lower than in primed treatments (Fig. 6C). All priming treatments on cauliflower seeds significantly improved proline accumulation with increasing concentration of the respective priming agents in the cauliflower seedlings grown under the salt stress regime (Fig. 6C). However, halopriming (NaCl priming) and proline priming proved very beneficial in terms of proline accumulation among all attempted priming treatments. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU (Fig. 6C). The current results showed that proline concentrations in cabbage increased with increasing salinity, consistent with previous results in salt-sensitive Napa cabbages [102]. It has been suggested that proline amino acid aggregation occurs more frequently than other amino acids in stressful environments and may be a factor in osmotic management and regulation of plant enzyme activity [103,104]. Accumulation of proline amino acids protects plant tissues from stress by acting as a fixative enzyme that reduces lipid peroxidation by improving membrane integrity and reducing cell membrane breakdown [[105], [106], [107], [108]]. In the current studies, the results showed that the non-primed control seedlings with no salt stress (NPN) were high in protein, while the non-primed control seedlings grown under salt stress (NPS) were lower in protein (Fig. 6B). When halo-primed (NaCl treatment), the protein content increased with increasing NaCl concentration from 25 mM NaCl to 50 mM NaCl and decreased when priming with 100 mM NaCl. When osmoprimed with proline and PEG, the protein content increased with increasing concentration of the priming agent. Higher concentrations of both priming agents, PEG and thiourea, showed the highest total soluble protein content in cauliflower seedlings grown under salt stress. However, water-primed seeds also slightly increased protein content, but the overall gain was much higher in the case of halo, TU, PEG, and proline priming (Fig. 6B). The growth of the free amino acid pool due to hydrolysis of protein during the osmotic adjustment process may account for the increase in total soluble protein under salt stress. Seed priming enhanced accumulation of all soluble proteins under a variety of abiotic stressors [[109], [110], [111], [112]]. Future research should address the mechanism by which seed preparation increases total protein content. In the present study, a reduction in Chl a, Chl b and total Chl was observed in the unprimed salt stressed (NPS) control, however, high chlorophyll content was found in the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control (Fig. 7). Interestingly, all priming approaches mitigated the deleterious effects of salinity on chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, and significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 7A–D). Proline priming proved to be much more beneficial for enhancing photosynthetic pigments than hydropriming alone. Halopriming was the least effective for pigment enhancement compared to other priming approaches in cauliflower. Salinity has a significant impact on all developmental traits. However, different treatments showed different responses to salinity sensitivity. Fig. 7 showed that the hydroprimed and NaCl pre-treated seedlings had no significant difference in Chl b but increased Chl a and total Chl in the NaCl pre-treated seedlings. The amount of photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves is affected by increased concentrations of Na+ and Cl− [113,114]. However, it has been discovered that as salinity increases, chlorophyll levels decrease. Salinity stress causes a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, which could be due to its negative effects on membrane integrity, decreased biosynthesis, or rapid pigment degradation [115,116]. It has also been observed that the long-term effects of salt cause the development of chlorophyll-protein-lipid complexes to be disrupted [117]. In the present study, seed primed with Pro, PEG and TU significantly increased total chlorophyll compared to hydropriming in salt stress (Fig. 7C). In the current investigation, proline priming significantly increased chlorophyll content, and proline treatment was also reported to favourably affect Chl a and total chlorophyll content in salt-stressed S. bicolor [118].5. Conclusion and future prospective The results of the present study showed that different sustainable eco-friendly, cost-effective, and user-friendly seed priming strategies, such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming, proved beneficial for improved germination indices and other morphophysiological traits under the regime of salt stress in Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis. The results were essentially related to proline accumulation in prepared cauliflower seedlings, which lowered MDA levels and alleviated lipid peroxidation (membrane damage) with increased total soluble protein and photosynthetic pigments on seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl. The present results imply that various priming agents such as water, NaCl, PEG, proline, and thiourea proved effective to accelerate the germination rate, synchronized growth, and metabolite activation under the high NaCl level. In summary, simple and affordable priming treatments such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming can be used to improve the performance of cauliflower crops. However, additional research on the beneficial effect of priming approaches will support the scalability of sustainable production and increased crop outputs, boosted crop quality and quantity, establishment, and reduction of salt damage in order to meet food demand, particularly on agricultural land under a variety of favorable and stressful conditions, as this is a priority of modern agricultural research. The information gained would also support molecular breeding research to develop cauliflower varieties that are more resistant to salt stress. Understanding the processes that promote salt stress tolerance can aid in the development of strategies to achieve sustainable crop yields under these adverse conditions.Author contribution statement Kuldeep Sharma and Monika Heikrujam: Conceived and designed the experiments.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds. Keywords: heat stress, hydroperoxide, lipid hydroperoxide, antioxidative enzymes, Pleopeltis polypodioides, fatty acids",
    "introduction": "Introduction Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity (Wang et al., 2016). Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis (Kotak et al., 2007), changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis (Greer, 2015), protein synthesis (Ferguson et al., 1994), and membrane fluidity (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014). Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins (Chen et al., 2018) is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress (Wen et al., 2005; Mathur et al., 2014). Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (Fv), and maximum (Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000), which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2013; Awasthi et al., 2015). Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress (Lu et al., 2008; Ergin et al., 2016). Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress (Jiang and Huang, 2001; Rizhsky et al., 2002; Lipiec et al., 2013; Zandalinas et al., 2018) and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress (Rizhsky et al., 2002; Bhardwaj et al., 2015; Zandalinas et al., 2018). However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors. Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa (Gaff, 1997). They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes (Lange, 1955; Nörr, 1974; Meyer and Santarius, 1998) and lichens (Lange, 1953; Tegler and Kershaw, 1981). Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Kappen, 1964) and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Eickmeier, 1986) and angiosperms (Hambler, 1961; Kappen, 1966; Vieweg and Ziegler, 1969) was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation (Macfarlane and Kershaw, 1978; Tegler and Kershaw, 1981; Eickmeier, 1986). However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern Pleopletis polypodioides in dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress. Pleopeltis polypodioides (aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration (Pessin, 1924; Stuart, 1968; John and Hasenstein, 2017). In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed (Pessin, 1924). Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation (Farrant et al., 1999; Helseth and Fischer, 2005). Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation (Pessin, 1924; Stuart, 1968; Helseth and Fischer, 2005; John and Hasenstein, 2017), and biochemical response to drought (Maslenkova and Homann, 2000; Georgieva and Maslenkova, 2001; Layton et al., 2010; John and Hasenstein, 2018) are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated. We evaluate the biochemical responses of dry and hydrated fronds of Pleopeltis to heat by assessing their photosynthetic and metabolic activities, levels of stress molecules, activities of antioxidative enzymes, membrane stability, and the fatty acid profile. Our results indicate that independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidative systems are sensitive to heat but dried fronds tolerate heat better than hydrated fronds.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Materials Because Pleopeltis fronds are highly responsive to environmental conditions and are efficient in water uptake compared to plants with intact rhizomes (John and Hasenstein, 2017), we focused on studying the thermal tolerance of isolated fronds. Hydrated fronds P. polypodioides were collected from live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (30.21 N, −92.02 W). All fronds were collected after a rain event during March to May from 2016 to 2019 and prior to experimentation maintained in a humid chamber at high RH. All fronds were between 4.5 and 5 cm long. The outline of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 1 and individual methodologies explained below. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Summary of the workflow of experiments and analyses performed on dried, rehydrated, and submersed Pleopeltis fronds. Data obtained from the initial sample status (red boxes) served a reference for all other treatments. Heat Treatment Heat treatment was applied for 24 h in darkness. Assays of heat treated dry and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) samples were compared with 25°C dry and fresh control, respectively. Dehydrated Fronds Detached, fresh fronds were dried at 25°C for 72 h, which reduces the RWC to < 5% (John and Hasenstein, 2018). After drying, the fronds were exposed to temperatures between 30 and 50°C for 24 h in an incubator. Relative humidity decreased as a function of temperature increase.Hydrated Fronds Detached fresh fronds were placed in DI water in 20 mL glass vials such that either the entire frond (vial filled with 20 mL water) or just the apical end (4 mL water) was submersed and exposed to the same temperature as dried fronds. The reason for different levels of submersion was to test the effect of oxygen deprivation in fronds that were fully submersed compared to 100% humidity. The data were compared with hydrated fronds (without immersion) at 25°C. Photosynthetic Performance The photosynthetic performance of the fronds before and after heat stress and after re-hydration was assessed by measuring the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F0, which is equivalent to Ft if the leaf sample is dark-adapted) and quantum yield (Qy) using a FluorPen FP100 (Photo Systems Instruments, Czechia). F0 was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m–2s–1 for 30 μs) and recorded as Ft. Similarly, Qy measurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (Fm) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m–2 s–1) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F0 and maximal fluorescence Fm divided by Fm, i.e., (Fm-F0)/Fm. We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Qy) of PS II system. Normal photosynthetic activity shows maximum Qy of about 0.83 (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000; Murchie and Lawson, 2013). We considered reduced values indicative of stress. The Ft and Qy data were collected from fresh, dried and 24 h heat treated fronds as well as after re-hydration for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature (25°C). Because obtaining reliable fluorescence measurements from curled (dried) fronds was difficult, the Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from flattened fronds that were dried between paper towels and glass plates for 5 days at room temperature. Dried and submersed fronds were examined after temperature treatments. Fronds were rehydrated on water-saturated foam under dim light, and were measured after 1, 5, and 24 h. Qy and Ft were identical in dark and dim-light-maintained fronds, we therefore report data of fronds measured under dim light (10 μM m–2 s–1). The Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from the base, center, and the tip of each of six fronds and shown as average of these positions. Membrane Permeability Cell membrane permeability was deduced from the conductivity (μS cm–1) of the water in which the fronds were submersed. Conductivity was measured with a MW 301 EC meter (Milwaukee Instruments, Inc.) in 4 mL samples for partially and 20 mL samples in fully submersed fronds and reported as μS normalized to 10 mL. After heat treatments, fronds were kept at room temperature for an additional 24 h to assess re-uptake of ions. Elemental analysis was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300 DV) in 15% HNO3. Metabolic Activity In their natural environment, Pleopeltis fronds are exposed to sometimes extreme fluctuations of temperatures, humidity, and light intensities. Our intention is to understand how Pleopeltis responds to heat stress. Because measuring enzyme activities of dried fronds inevitably requires hydration, metabolic activities of dried fronds may not represent the actual activity in the dried state but indicate available metabolites and metabolic capacity at the endpoint of dehydration. Despite these limitations, the following tests were performed with dehydrated and hydrated fronds. Tissue Viability The reduction of resazurin as described in John and Hasenstein (2017) served as proxy for the assessment of vitality. Pinnae [100 mg dry weight equivalents, calculated as FW/(1-RWC) as documented in John and Hasenstein (2018)] were macerated in 2 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.2 mL of 4 mM resazurin (Sigma R7017), and incubated under continuous illumination (∼300 μM m–2 s–1) at 25°C for 3 h before the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined (Varian Cary, λex = 560 nm; λem = 590 nm).Hydroperoxide Determination Hydroperoxide (and other water-soluble peroxide) content was measured using the ferrous ammonium sulfate/xylenol orange, FOX I assay (Wolff, 1994; Cheeseman, 2006) at 560 nm (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Hydroperoxide quantification in μM was based on a standard curve and calculated as (OD560 – 0.004)/0.0763.Measurement of Lipid Peroxide The FOX II assay was used to quantify lipid peroxides, LOOHs (Jiang et al., 1992; Gay and Gebicki, 2003) according to John and Hasenstein (2018) such that (OD560 − 0.1305)/0.0383, determines the BHT equivalent in nM.Catalase Activity Catalase activity was determined from the decrease of OD240 of H2O2 for 180 s (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Based on 100 mg samples, enzyme activity was expressed as μM × min–1 × mg protein–1.Consumption of Reduced Glutathione The consumption of GSH was measured as described earlier (John and Hasenstein, 2018). The assay was modified after (Starlin and Gopalakrishnan, 2013). Samples (100 mg DW equivalent) were extracted in chilled sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, pH 7, 2 mL) and centrifuged (23,000 g, 12 min, 4°C). 500 μL supernatant was transferred into a fresh centrifuge tube, mixed with 400 μL 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 μL 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma, S-2002), 200 μL DI water, and vortexed. After adding 200 μL (4 mM) GSH (Cayman chemical company, 10007461) and 100 μL 2.5 mM H2O2, the solution was mixed and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company, 76-03-9). The solution was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged (23,000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 1.5 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1 mL 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma, D8130). After inversion, OD 409 was determined. Enzyme activity is reported as μM GSH consumed min–1 × mg protein–1. Protein Determination Protein content for the enzyme assays was determined according to Bradford (1976) using ovalbumin (Sigma, A-5378) as standard. Fatty Acid Analysis Fatty acids were extracted from tissue equivalent to 100 mg fresh weight, derivatized to their methyl esters, and quantified (John and Hasenstein, 2018) using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE, United States) gas chromatograph (6890) with mass selective detector (5973). One μL samples were injected and separated on a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5MS column with hydrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1. The temperature profile started at 100°C for 2 min, ramped (10°C × min–1) to 280°C and held for another 8 min. Identification of compounds was based on the National Institute of Science and Technology library 2008 in Chemstation software (E.02.02.1431). The quantity of individual fatty acids was determined based on retention time and slope of derivatized palmitic acid (Sigma, P-5917; Rt = 11.7 min; 3.98 × 106 TIC ng–1), linoleic acid (Sigma, L1376; Rt = 13.3 min, 3.53 × 106 TIC ng–1), linolenic acid (Cayman Chemical Company, 90210; Rt = 13.37 min; 2.51 × 106 TIC ng–1), oleic acid (Sigma, O1630; Rt = 13.4 min; 1.88 × 106 TIC ng–1), and stearic acid (Sigma, S-4751; Rt = 13.6 min; 3.05 × 106 TIC ng–1). Tissue samples were analyzed under identical conditions as standards. Statistical Analysis The data are reported as means of three to six biological replicates obtained from individual fronds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was performed using Excel data analysis tool pack (Microsoft Corporation, 2016).",
    "results": "Results Morphological Response Pinnae of dried Pleopeltis fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature treatment (Figures 2A–C). Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration. Exposure to 55°C resulted in patchy browning along the mid-rib (rachis) of the frond (Figure 2D); after 60°C fronds were slightly (Figure 2E) and after 65°C completely discolored (Figure 2F). Submersed (Figure 2G) and partly submersed (Figure 2J) fronds showed no effects at 30°C but after exposure > 40°C submersed (Figures 2H,I) and partly submersed (Figures 2K,L) fronds showed browning. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Response of dehydrated (A,B,C), submersed (G,H,I), and partly submersed (J,K,L) fronds to 24 h heating at 30, 40, and 50°C, and fronds re-hydrated after exposure to 55, 60, and 65°C (D,E,F). Exposure to ≥ 40°C resulted in tight curling of dehydrated fronds and browning of the hydrated fronds. Re-hydrated fronds show discoloration near the rachis between 55 and 60°C and complete discoloration of the frond after 65°C. Scale bar = 1 cm. Photosynthetic Performance Dried Frond Instantaneous fluorescence (Ft) of treated dried fronds measured lower than (control) dry fronds at 25°C (Figure 3A) while Qy of fronds exposed to 30°C and higher was not detectable (Figure 3B). Interestingly, Ft of 65°C treated samples was higher than 60°C and not different from control (Figure 3A), whereas Qy even after rehydration remained undetectable (Figure 3B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll fluorescence, Ft (A,C,E) and Qy (B,D,F) data of dry, re-hydrated, partially, and fully submersed Pleopeltis fronds after 24 h exposure to different temperatures. Control values ± SE @ 25°C for Ft and Qy of dry fronds are indicated by dashed lines (A,B) and for rehydrated fronds by dotted lines (A–F). The Ft and Qy of heat-treated, dry samples are compared with 25°C dry samples (A,B); dried fronds did not show measurable Qy values regardless of temperature. Re-hydrated and hydrated samples are compared with 25°C fresh samples (C–F). Significant differences between controls and treatments are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6.Re-hydrated Fronds After rehydration, the chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) increased over time and reached control levels within 5 h for temperatures up to 35°C (Figure 3A). However, exposure to higher temperatures (≤55°C) required a recovery period of 24 h. Despite the high Ft values, the Qy decreased with higher temperatures (Figure 3B). Ft of 1-h re-hydrated fronds was low compared to (fresh) control but measurable at all temperature ranges, i.e., 30–65°C (Figure 3A). However, the Qy value decreased from 30 to 50°C and was not detectable at > 50°C (Figure 3B). Similarly, Ft of fronds re-hydrated for 5 h after less than 40°C showed values similar to (fresh) controls (Figure 3A) but Ft was lower in rehydrated fronds exposed to ≥ 45° [F(5,30) = 18, P < 0.0001]. The Qy of 5 h re-hydrated fronds was lower than in controls [F(8,45) = 37.5, P < 0.0001] but greater than after 1 h re-hydration [F(1,94) = 55.8, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3B). Beyond 45°C, Qy efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature (Figure 3B); there was no recovery after exposure to 65°C. Based on these data, Qy is a better indicator of sensing heat than Ft.Hydrated Fronds Despite some increase after 30 and 40°C treatments, Ft of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°C [F(2,15) = 312, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3C); in contrast Qy was already significantly reduced at 40°C [F(1,10) = 217, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3D). After recovery (at room temperature for 24 h), Ft and Qy of 30 and 35°C treated samples did not differ from controls (Figures 3C,D). However, in 40°C treated samples Qy remained significantly lower than base-line values [F(1,10) = 711.6, P < 0.0001], which suggests that hydration is beneficial for samples exposed to temperatures below 40°C. Unchanging but measurable Ft values in ≥ 45°C fronds and the lack of recovery of Qy after 40°C indicates degradation of PS II. In fully submersed samples, chlorophyll fluorescence was higher but Qy suppression was stronger than in partly submersed fronds (Figure 3F). All heat-stressed samples showed reduced Ft values after the recovery period, indicating that chlorophyll degradation continues during this time. The Qy values of ≥ 40°C treated samples remained undetectable (Figure 3F). Overall, the samples exposed to ≥ 40°C showed a response similar to partially submersed fronds. The data clearly show that hydration renders the photosynthetic apparatus more sensitive to heat stress than dried fronds. Importantly, the similarity between partial and full hydration suggests that reduced gas exchange in submersed fronds is not the cause of the decline of Qy. Ion Leakage To assess the response of cell membranes to heat stress, we measured the conductivity of external water from partly and fully submersed samples treated between 30 and 50°C (Figure 4). Although the fronds were washed before the experiments to minimize surface contamination, the conductivity (normalized to 10 mL) at 30 and 35°C were not different from controls, did not differ between partly and fully submersed samples, and likely represents surface-bound ions or normal ion exchange. However, treatment of ≥ 40°C strongly increased the conductivity of fully and partly submersed fronds, indicating membrane leakiness (Figure 4). There was no reduction in conductivity after 24 h recovery at RT (Figure 4); thus, there was no re-uptake of ions during the recovery phase. The conductivities of submersed samples were higher than those of partly submersed samples (Figure 4). The ion concentration was clearly dependent on the extent of immersion, indicating that long-distance transport did not contribute to the ion release. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Electrolyte leakage measured as conductivity of external water after 24 h at various temperatures and after a 24 h recovery period at RT. Differences in conductivity between heat treated and 25°C control are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6.Elemental analysis of the leachate revealed that K+ is the major released ion followed by Ca+2 and S (Figure 5). Na+ and Mg2+ were present at lower quantities. K+ and S in the leachate increased with temperature and both elements showed the largest increase at 40°C (Figure 5). Ca+2 loss occurred more evenly across the tested temperature range and like Na+ did not show a distinct threshold temperature (Figure 5). Unlike partly submersed samples, the ions from submersed fronds did not increase beyond 40°C, which indicates that membrane damage occurs at that temperature. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Elemental analysis of leachate from partially (hatched bars) and fully submersed (solid bars) Pleopeltis fronds. Significant differences between heat treated and 25°C control are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 3. Reducing Capacity Generic reducing capacity represents overall metabolic activity. Dried fronds showed significantly lower activity than hydrated tissue [F(4,25) = 19.6, P < 0.0001] below 45°C but their reducing capacity exceeded that of submersed tissue at higher temperatures (Figure 6) regardless of the type of submersion. Despite declining reducing capacity of dried fronds at elevated temperatures, dried fronds showed metabolic activity. Likewise, the reducing capacity remained higher in partly than in fully submersed fronds [F(1,10) = 4.9, P = 0.05] (Figure 6). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Reduction of resazurin in dried fronds and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) fronds exposed to heat for 24 h. The metabolic activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6. Hydroperoxides The hydroperoxide content of dried fronds increased gradually with temperature and reached a maximum at 40°C (Figure 7). Fully and partly submersed fronds responded similarly and showed their highest values at 35°C (Figure 7). Higher temperatures led to a decrease on peroxides that was less in dried than in submersed fronds. The moderate increase in dry but stronger increase in hydrated fronds suggests that peroxide accumulates during heat stress but declines when the stress exceeds the metabolic capacity. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Hydroperoxide content in dried, fully, or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to various temperatures for 24 h. The content from heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4. Lipid Hydroperoxides The LOOH pattern was similar to hydroperoxides; dried fronds showed a steady increase with temperature with a maximum at 40°C [F(4,15) = 3.7, P = 0.03] (Figure 8). Partly and fully submersed samples reached their maximum at 35°C but showed lower levels of LOOH than dried fronds at 45 and 50°C (Figure 8), likely related to damaged metabolism, which weakens the response. Therefore, similar to the hydroperoxide profile, the maximum LOOH values signal the onset of non-compensated, i.e., damaging, heat stress. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) content in dried and fully or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The content from heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4. Catalase Activity The greatest difference between dried and fresh tissue was measured at 25°C (Figure 9). Dried fronds showed their highest CAT activity at 30°C but the decline at higher temperatures was less than in hydrated fronds [F(2,57) = 3.1, P = 0.05]. Like dry fronds, submersed fronds showed a steady decline in CAT activity and the extent of submersion had no effect (Figure 9). Because CAT activity in dried fronds was significantly higher after 30°C treatment than at 25°C and significantly reduced in hydrated fronds at 35°C, CAT activity was higher in hydrated vs. dried tissue. CAT activity is remarkably temperature sensitive and the decline at 35°C indicates a stress response of CAT-linked processes. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Catalase activity in dried and fully or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4. Glutathione (GSH) Consumption Glutathione consumption responded stronger to desiccation than heat stress [F(2,57) = 363, P < 0.0001] (Figure 10). GSH consumption in dried fronds decreased at ≥ 45°C [F(1,6) = 13.3, P = 0.01] compared to 30–40°C treated samples (Figure 10). GSH consumption of hydrated fronds showed a similar reduction and the extent of submersion had no effect. GSH utilization of 30°C dried and hydrated samples did not differ from the respective 25°C controls. FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab H2O2-dependent glutathione oxidation activity in dried and partially and fully submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by ∗ (P ≤ 0.05); means ± SE, n = 4. Fatty Acid (FA) Profile Temperature stress changed the FA composition and quantity in all samples. The total FA content in dehydrated fronds increased up to 35°C but decreased at higher temperatures (Figure 11A). In partly and fully submersed fronds, the total fatty acid reached its peak at 30°C and declined at higher temperatures (Figures 11B,C); the FA content in 50°C treated dried and hydrated samples was 76% and 90% lower than 30°C treated fronds, respectively (Figure 11). FIGURE 11. Open in a new tab FA profiles in dried (A), partly submersed (B), and fully submersed (C) fronds after exposure to various temperatures for 24 h. 16:0 = palmitic acid; 18:0 = stearic acid; 18:1 = oleic acid; 18:2 = linoleic acid; 18:3 = linolenic acid. Significance levels are based on the FA content of 25°C dry and hydrated fronds, respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4.Palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acid were detected in controls and heat-treated fronds but linolenic acid (18:3) was the dominant FA at all temperatures and the total amount of fatty acids in fully submersed fronds was higher than in dried and partly submersed samples (Figure 11). The extent of unsaturation correlated with peroxidation; therefore, we examined the degree of unsaturation for each temperature. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (18:1, 18:2, 18:3) in 30°C, dried and partly submersed samples was 12 and 5% lower than at 25°C (Figure 11). Exposure to temperatures higher than 30°C decreased unsaturation, especially in partly submersed samples (Figure 11 and Supplementary Table 1). Regardless of the hydration condition, after exposure to temperatures of 45°C and higher, all FAs showed reduced but equal quantities. In general, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids was higher in dried than in hydrated fronds; and declined in dried fronds above 40°C; this reduction began in hydrated fronds at 35°C.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. As stated under section “Materials and Methods,” it is important to reiterate the arbitrary nature of the study. The problematic aspects include the duration of the temperature treatment and the testing of various processes and enzymatic activities. It is unlikely that in nature temperatures greater than 40°C extend for more than 12 h. Nonetheless, heat tolerance was tested previously for an equally arbitrary time of 30 min, which resulted in tolerance of > 100°C (Lange, 1955). While evaporative cooling likely provides some protection during short-term heat exposure, our heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. Similarly, submersion of fronds eliminates water stress but may cause different stress for the epiphytic Pleopletis as was shown by the lower reducing capacity (Figure 6) and reduced Qy (Figure 3F) of completely vs. partially submersed fronds (Figure 3D). This sensitivity may be the result of reduced gas exchange (Voesenek et al., 2006), or the enhanced activity of symbiotic surface organisms (Koch and Barthlott, 2009); both phenomena can lead to anoxia (Blokhina et al., 2003; Banti et al., 2010). Nonetheless, the differences between the submersion treatments illustrate the sensitivity of the fronds to different conditions and allow for nuanced evaluation of heat effects. Stress response includes changes in morphology, cellular functions, metabolism, and ultimately gene expression. Because of the reduced metabolism under dry conditions, it is likely that dry tissue shows reduced susceptibility to heat damage. The co-variance between desiccation and heat may induce changes in cell wall and thus frond shape (Wu et al., 2018) a suitable indicator for heat stress of dry material (Figure 2). However, fronds expanded even after exposure to 65°C; therefore, heat stress cannot be assessed solely through changes in shape or color. Changes in Frond Shape and Color In response to increasing temperature, dehydrated Pleopeltis fronds became thinner, pinnae curled tighter (Figures 2B,C), and after exposure to ≥ 45°C fronds became brittle. Such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall polymers (Lima et al., 2013). These changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores (Ballesteros et al., 2017). Among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall (Willats et al., 2001) and heat sensitivity (Lima et al., 2013). Loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation (Willats et al., 2001; Bethke et al., 2016). Pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temperatures, but further research is needed to assess the status of pectin in the cell wall of dried Pleopeltis fronds. Fronds exposed to 30–50°C fully expanded upon rehydration (at 25°C) and did not show necrosis, or changes in shape of the fronds (data not shown). Discolorations of hydrated fronds after exposure to ≥ 35°C (Figures 2E–I) and re-hydrated fronds after exposure to > 55°C (Figure 2) indicate that these fronds have experienced stress beyond their thermal tolerance resulting in chloroplast or chlorophyll degradation, which eventually leads to senescence (Jespersen et al., 2016) and programmed cell death (PCD) (Qu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015). One of the key enzymes known to regulate the breakdown of chlorophyll is pheophytinase (Schelbert et al., 2009). It is possible that the activity of this enzyme increases at high temperatures, similar to observations in bentgrass (Jespersen et al., 2016). Stress-induced chlorophyll degradation is also affected by ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and ROS (Xu and Huang, 2007). These compounds also influence PS II-mediated electron transport (Xu and Huang, 2007; Griffiths et al., 2014), and membrane-bound ion channels (Demidchik, 2018), proteins, and lipids (Veerasamy et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2014). Based on browning, our morphological data indicate that 40°C is the threshold for heat damage for hydrated Pleopeltis fronds (Figures 2E–I); in contrast, dried fronds can tolerate > 60°C (Figure 2). Photosynthetic Susceptibility Dried Fronds Fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) of dried fronds were lower than in fresh fronds but readily detectable (Figures 3A,B), indicating that drying decreases but not completely blocks photosynthetic activity. After dry fronds were exposed to > 50°C, Qy was undetectable (Figure 3B) and Ft decreased (Figure 3A) suggesting that the PS II system responds to stress and is blocked by heat (Yamada et al., 1996). This disruption likely protects the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage. Interestingly, after exposure to 65°C, Ft was higher than after 60°C exposure or in non-heat-treated, dry fronds (Figure 3A), suggesting that extreme temperatures (i.e., 65°C) lead to the disintegration of the photosynthetic reaction center (Wise et al., 2004; Kadir et al., 2007) but chlorophyll fluorescence persists. Thus, based on the Ft and Qy data, the photosynthetic apparatus in dry fronds is heat-tolerant up to 60°C. The photosynthetic apparatus adjusts to stress in several ways, including elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which can lead to increases in Zeaxanthin and other pigments even under dark conditions (Brüggemann et al., 2009; Leuenberger et al., 2017) and ROS (Ramel et al., 2012). Thus, pigment metabolism may be an important element of stress response. The recovery of the photosynthetic performances (Ft and Qy) following re-hydration was time dependent. Qy values of fronds exposed to 30°C reached control values within 5 h of re-hydration but required at least 24 h in fronds exposed to higher temperatures (Figure 3B). The slow recovery of Qy performance indicates that heat exerts long-term stress on the PS II system, likely by interfering with the water oxidation complex (Srivastava et al., 1997) and/or PS II energy transfer (Kadir et al., 2007). Fronds re-hydrated after 60°C appeared photosynthetically functional but at significantly reduced efficiency (Figures 3A,B), which suggests that repair processes are damaged (Allakhverdiev et al., 2008). Photosynthetic activity (Qy) in re-hydrated fronds after 65°C was not detectable (Figure 3B), and indicates irreversible damage (Kadir et al., 2007). Thus, similar to morphological data, Ft and Qy measurements indicate that the maximal heat tolerance of dehydrated Pleopeltis is 60°C. These data indicate that chlorophyll and/or the reaction center remain intact in spite of absence of PS II activity. The lack of photosynthetic activity may protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage.Hydrated Fronds Ft and Qy of partly and fully submersed (Figures 3C–F) fronds exposed to ≤ 35°C were not affected. However, at 40°C, Qy decreased while Ft increased. Similar to observations in dried tissue, this unequal response indicates a dichotomy between chlorophyll stability and reduced photosynthetic efficiency, possibly as a result from inactivation of the oxygen evolving system (Wise et al., 2004) and/or the PS II reaction center (Bolharnordenkampe et al., 1989). The reduction of Ft at > 40°C and non-detectable Qy (Figures 3D,F) indicates that the fronds become photosynthetically non-functional beyond 40°C and identifies the thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds as 40°C. Electrolyte Leakage An increase in conductivity of the external medium indicates cell membrane damage and efflux of ions (Ilik et al., 2018). High conductivity in fully submersed samples relative to partly submersed suggests that the integrity of the membrane is affected by the combination of heat and extent of immersion. Further, the absence of gas exchange seems to negatively impact membrane stability, especially at temperatures > 35°C. Low conductivity in partly and fully submersed samples at ≤ 35°C and no difference from the control likely represents regular ion exchange in intact membranes that is maintained until about 35°C (Figure 4A). During the ensuing 24 h recovery period, the (slight) decrease in conductivity suggests at least partial reuptake of ions (Figure 4B). Since re-absorption is an active process, it is likely that this process is dependent on the activity of plasma membrane proton ATPase, which is reported to be activated by the combination of high temperature and resulting membrane lipid modification (Viegas et al., 1995). Leaching from leaves is broadly defined as removal of substances from plant leaves by action of rain, fog, dew, and washing (Tukey, 1970). Other factors such as stress, water content, nutrient availability, and physical characteristics of the tissue also influence the extent of leaching (Tukey, 1970). In partly submersed samples, presence of relatively lower amount of water and interaction of vapor mixture with the tissue surface may contribute to leaching. Additionally, since Pleopeltis fronds readily absorb water (John and Hasenstein, 2017), it is likely that water permeability contributes to ion loss. The higher quantity of ions in the leachate (Figure 5) and high conductivity (Figure 4) in fully submersed samples compared to partly submersed samples is likely proportional to the extent a submersion but indicates the deleterious effect of heat on membrane stability. The most abundant ion found in the leachate was K+ (Figure 5) consistent with its vital role in the osmoregulation (Cochrane and Cochrane, 2009). Loss of ions in general likely triggers ROS production that leads to oxidative stress and eventually cell death (Demidchik et al., 2014). Taken together, photosynthetic data (Figure 3) and cation leakage (Figure 4) suggest that thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds is 40°C. Metabolism Metabolically active cells rely on a steady supply of reduced compounds; therefore, the concentration of reduction equivalents is a measure of metabolic health. However, assessing the metabolic status of dried Pleopeltis through aqueous redox dyes is problematic because tissue rehydrates in the dye solution. Therefore, our data report the reduction capacity of dried fronds immediately after hydration. Nonetheless, the temperature and hydration variability of the data indicates that the measurements provide a meaningful estimate of the reduction capacity. The declining reducing capacity with increasing temperatures (Figure 6) is likely the result of diminished electron transport (Hüve et al., 2011)and uncoupled photosynthetic electron transport (Sharkey and Zhang, 2010; Awasthi et al., 2015). Because metabolic activity of dried fronds was detectable, dehydrated Pleopeltis remain metabolically active up to at 40°C (Figure 6). Metabolic changes in desiccated moss tissue resulted in a glassy state only after rapid desiccation where enzymatic reactions were absent. In contrast, slow drying achieved a “rubbery state” (Fernandez-Marin et al., 2013). We assume that the slow drying of Pleopeltis and its maintained flexibility is indicative of a non-glassy state with reduced metabolism. Hydrated fronds showed higher metabolic activity than dried fronds up to 40°C (Figure 6) but similar values at higher temperatures. This observation corresponds to the heat sensitivity of imbibed seeds, which deteriorate at high temperature compared to dried seeds (Hill and Johnstone, 1985). The metabolism of hydrated fronds is similar to the photosynthetic performance (Figures 3C–F) and is similar to the thermotolerance of other tropical and sub-tropical plants (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014). Exposure of plants to heat loads beyond their tolerance level leads to senescence, necrotic symptoms (Figures 2E–I), or apoptosis (Reape and McCabe, 2008). Apoptosis or PCD is typically estimated by the loss of metabolic functions (as in Figure 6) and characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and breakup of a cell into small apoptotic bodies (van Doorn et al., 2011). In contrast, necrosis is characterized as a chaotic and uncontrolled form of cell death that involves early rupture of the plasma membrane (van Doorn et al., 2011) and confined swelling of the cell (Reape et al., 2008). Viability stains can assess overall cell health but cannot distinguish between PCD and necrosis (Reape et al., 2008). To determine the type of cell death that occurs in Pleopeltis in response to heat stress, examination of endomembranes, nuclease activity, and DNA integrity would be essential, as has been shown in carrot (McCabe et al., 1997) and tobacco cells (Burbridge et al., 2006). Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities The increase of ROS (Figure 7) in dry and hydrated fronds suggests that Pleopeltis experiences oxidative stress (Ali et al., 2005; Awasthi et al., 2015). The decline of ROS for hydrated but not dried fronds at > 40°C indicates that dehydrated fronds are capable of coping with elevated ROS at higher temperatures than hydrated fronds. The high levels of peroxides at 40°C (Figures 7, 8) also support heat tolerance to about 40°C. Pleopeltis, like most plants, responds to heat by enhanced production of ROS (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014), which in turn activate signal transduction and ultimately defense mechanisms and PCD (Burbridge et al., 2006). Therefore, the decrease of hydroperoxide (Figure 7) and lipid hydroperoxide (Figure 8) above 40°C indicates damaging, possibly lethal, shifts in the redox equilibrium (Foyer and Noctor, 2005; Suzuki et al., 2012). In addition to elevated ROS, the decreased availability of antioxidants or activity of reducing enzymes likely enhances ROS toxicity. CAT, an important enzyme for the detoxification of H2O2, is sensitive to elevated temperatures (Figure 9) and has been reported to decline upon dehydration (John and Hasenstein, 2018). The heat correlated reduction of CAT activity suggests that CAT is unable to detoxify ROS as also reported by Ali et al. (2005). Reduced CAT activity and high amounts of hydroperoxides may lead to an oxidative environment that then enhances consumption of GSH, a phenomenon also observed in Arabidopsis (Queval et al., 2011) and barley mutants (Smith et al., 1985) that lack CAT activity. GSH-oxidation increases during dehydration (John and Hasenstein, 2018) and heat-stressed, dried fronds maintain their high GSH levels up to 40°C (Figure 10). Thus, GSH oxidizing enzymes have greater heat tolerance than CAT. It is also possible that the accumulation of the oxidized form of GSH (GSSG) in chloroplasts and vacuoles (Queval et al., 2011) is important for redox regulation, especially during stress (Smith et al., 1985; Tommasini et al., 1993). Hydrated fronds accumulate high levels of hydro- (Figure 7) and lipid hydroperoxide (Figure 8) up to 40°C. These stress indicators could be a response to electrolyte leakage (Figure 4), as reported for bentgrass (Liu and Huang, 2000). However, unlike bentgrass which showed increased lipid peroxide and electrolyte leakage, Pleopeltis exhibited increased electrolyte leakage (Figure 4) but LOOH content decreased at > 40°C (Figure 8), which could result from interactions between peroxide (Figure 7) and membrane-bound unsaturated fatty acids (Figures 11B,C) (Blokhina et al., 2003). These results suggest that (hydrated) Pleopeltis membranes are affected even by temperatures below ≤ 40°C. Because CAT (Figure 9) and GSH consuming enzymes (Figure 10) may protect membranes, further research is needed to determine temperature effects on membrane integrity. Fatty Acids Stress-responsive metabolites in plants include fatty acids (Su et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2011; Ahmad et al., 2013). Our data confirm this notion because the FA composition of Pleopeltis fronds changes with temperature and hydration (Figure 11). Increasing temperature reduces desaturation and overall FA quantity, which indicates that heat interferes with either fatty acid synthesis and/or stimulates fatty acid breakdown. On average, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in dried fronds was higher than in hydrated fronds (Supplementary Table 1), which may protect the temperature sensitive photosynthetic apparatus (Gombos et al., 1994). Additionally, unsaturation declined in dried fronds at temperatures > 40 and > 35°C in hydrated fronds (Figure 11), suggesting that heat stress increases saturation of fatty acids. Saturated FAs reduce membrane fluidity and enhance integrity (Ahmad et al., 2013; Sakhno et al., 2014). Both parameters are important for surviving high temperatures (Murata and Los, 1997; Upchurch, 2008). Additionally, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid makes membranes susceptible to peroxidation (Liu and Huang, 2004), which corresponds to our observation of higher LOOH in heat-stressed, dry fronds compared with hydrated fronds (Figure 8). Although saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 18:0) made up a small fraction of the total fatty acid pool (Figure 11), their presence likely contributes to membrane stability and heat tolerance (Liu and Huang, 2004; Ahmad et al., 2013). The decline of all fatty acids at elevated temperatures (Figure 11) links the fatty acid content to senescence (Koiwai et al., 1981; Yang and Ohlrogge, 2009). Even though senescence is not detectable in dried fronds, high amounts of lipid hydroperoxides (Figure 8) imply that dehydrated fronds are also affected by heat-induced membrane damage. The sensitivity of FA spectra to temperature and hydration indicates that FA profiling can be an effective stress indicator. Future studies will decipher how the FA profile changes with the extent and duration of stress, and during recovery. Dried material undergoes metabolic reactions of lipids (Golovina et al., 2010) and longevity has been attributed to “differences in the structure or mobility of molecules within the solidified cytoplasm” (Ballesteros et al., 2017). The remaining elasticity of dried Pleopeltis fronds suggests that they are below the glass transition threshold and therefore capable of low-level metabolism. The changing levels of FAs are indicative of ongoing metabolism in tissue with low water content (Figure 11). One could speculate that the stress response to drying includes enhanced lipid biosynthesis (Quartacci et al., 2002) to maintain membrane fluidity (Murata and Los, 1997; Ahmad et al., 2013) and that elevated temperatures enhance respiration such that beta oxidation of FAs leads to their lowered content. Future studies will analyze the time course of these rather drastic changes, and how the FA profile changes during recovery.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion The mechanism of Pleopeltis response to heat stress is complex. Our biochemical data indicate that > 40°C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds. Despite obvious stress signals, dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55°C while thermo-tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40°C. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects Pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress.",

Copyright notice ID: 7733933 PMID: 33329661 Abstract Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds. Keywords: heat stress, hydroperoxide, lipid hydroperoxide, antioxidative enzymes, Pleopeltis polypodioides, fatty acidsIntroduction Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity (Wang et al., 2016). Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis (Kotak et al., 2007), changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis (Greer, 2015), protein synthesis (Ferguson et al., 1994), and membrane fluidity (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014). Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins (Chen et al., 2018) is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress (Wen et al., 2005; Mathur et al., 2014). Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (Fv), and maximum (Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000), which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2013; Awasthi et al., 2015). Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress (Lu et al., 2008; Ergin et al., 2016). Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress (Jiang and Huang, 2001; Rizhsky et al., 2002; Lipiec et al., 2013; Zandalinas et al., 2018) and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress (Rizhsky et al., 2002; Bhardwaj et al., 2015; Zandalinas et al., 2018). However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors. Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa (Gaff, 1997). They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes (Lange, 1955; Nörr, 1974; Meyer and Santarius, 1998) and lichens (Lange, 1953; Tegler and Kershaw, 1981). Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Kappen, 1964) and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Eickmeier, 1986) and angiosperms (Hambler, 1961; Kappen, 1966; Vieweg and Ziegler, 1969) was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation (Macfarlane and Kershaw, 1978; Tegler and Kershaw, 1981; Eickmeier, 1986). However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern Pleopletis polypodioides in dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress. Pleopeltis polypodioides (aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration (Pessin, 1924; Stuart, 1968; John and Hasenstein, 2017). In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed (Pessin, 1924). Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation (Farrant et al., 1999; Helseth and Fischer, 2005). Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation (Pessin, 1924; Stuart, 1968; Helseth and Fischer, 2005; John and Hasenstein, 2017), and biochemical response to drought (Maslenkova and Homann, 2000; Georgieva and Maslenkova, 2001; Layton et al., 2010; John and Hasenstein, 2018) are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated. We evaluate the biochemical responses of dry and hydrated fronds of Pleopeltis to heat by assessing their photosynthetic and metabolic activities, levels of stress molecules, activities of antioxidative enzymes, membrane stability, and the fatty acid profile. Our results indicate that independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidative systems are sensitive to heat but dried fronds tolerate heat better than hydrated fronds.Materials and Methods Plant Materials Because Pleopeltis fronds are highly responsive to environmental conditions and are efficient in water uptake compared to plants with intact rhizomes (John and Hasenstein, 2017), we focused on studying the thermal tolerance of isolated fronds. Hydrated fronds P. polypodioides were collected from live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (30.21 N, −92.02 W). All fronds were collected after a rain event during March to May from 2016 to 2019 and prior to experimentation maintained in a humid chamber at high RH. All fronds were between 4.5 and 5 cm long. The outline of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 1 and individual methodologies explained below. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Summary of the workflow of experiments and analyses performed on dried, rehydrated, and submersed Pleopeltis fronds. Data obtained from the initial sample status (red boxes) served a reference for all other treatments.Heat Treatment Heat treatment was applied for 24 h in darkness. Assays of heat treated dry and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) samples were compared with 25°C dry and fresh control, respectively. Dehydrated Fronds Detached, fresh fronds were dried at 25°C for 72 h, which reduces the RWC to < 5% (John and Hasenstein, 2018). After drying, the fronds were exposed to temperatures between 30 and 50°C for 24 h in an incubator. Relative humidity decreased as a function of temperature increase.Hydrated Fronds Detached fresh fronds were placed in DI water in 20 mL glass vials such that either the entire frond (vial filled with 20 mL water) or just the apical end (4 mL water) was submersed and exposed to the same temperature as dried fronds. The reason for different levels of submersion was to test the effect of oxygen deprivation in fronds that were fully submersed compared to 100% humidity. The data were compared with hydrated fronds (without immersion) at 25°C.Photosynthetic Performance The photosynthetic performance of the fronds before and after heat stress and after re-hydration was assessed by measuring the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F0, which is equivalent to Ft if the leaf sample is dark-adapted) and quantum yield (Qy) using a FluorPen FP100 (Photo Systems Instruments, Czechia). F0 was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m–2s–1 for 30 μs) and recorded as Ft. Similarly, Qy measurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (Fm) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m–2 s–1) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F0 and maximal fluorescence Fm divided by Fm, i.e., (Fm-F0)/Fm. We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Qy) of PS II system. Normal photosynthetic activity shows maximum Qy of about 0.83 (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000; Murchie and Lawson, 2013). We considered reduced values indicative of stress. The Ft and Qy data were collected from fresh, dried and 24 h heat treated fronds as well as after re-hydration for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature (25°C). Because obtaining reliable fluorescence measurements from curled (dried) fronds was difficult, the Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from flattened fronds that were dried between paper towels and glass plates for 5 days at room temperature. Dried and submersed fronds were examined after temperature treatments. Fronds were rehydrated on water-saturated foam under dim light, and were measured after 1, 5, and 24 h. Qy and Ft were identical in dark and dim-light-maintained fronds, we therefore report data of fronds measured under dim light (10 μM m–2 s–1). The Ft and Qy measurements were obtained from the base, center, and the tip of each of six fronds and shown as average of these positions.Membrane Permeability Cell membrane permeability was deduced from the conductivity (μS cm–1) of the water in which the fronds were submersed. Conductivity was measured with a MW 301 EC meter (Milwaukee Instruments, Inc.) in 4 mL samples for partially and 20 mL samples in fully submersed fronds and reported as μS normalized to 10 mL. After heat treatments, fronds were kept at room temperature for an additional 24 h to assess re-uptake of ions. Elemental analysis was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300 DV) in 15% HNO3.Metabolic Activity In their natural environment, Pleopeltis fronds are exposed to sometimes extreme fluctuations of temperatures, humidity, and light intensities. Our intention is to understand how Pleopeltis responds to heat stress. Because measuring enzyme activities of dried fronds inevitably requires hydration, metabolic activities of dried fronds may not represent the actual activity in the dried state but indicate available metabolites and metabolic capacity at the endpoint of dehydration. Despite these limitations, the following tests were performed with dehydrated and hydrated fronds. Tissue Viability The reduction of resazurin as described in John and Hasenstein (2017) served as proxy for the assessment of vitality. Pinnae [100 mg dry weight equivalents, calculated as FW/(1-RWC) as documented in John and Hasenstein (2018)] were macerated in 2 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.2 mL of 4 mM resazurin (Sigma R7017), and incubated under continuous illumination (∼300 μM m–2 s–1) at 25°C for 3 h before the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined (Varian Cary, λex = 560 nm; λem = 590 nm).Hydroperoxide Determination Hydroperoxide (and other water-soluble peroxide) content was measured using the ferrous ammonium sulfate/xylenol orange, FOX I assay (Wolff, 1994; Cheeseman, 2006) at 560 nm (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Hydroperoxide quantification in μM was based on a standard curve and calculated as (OD560 – 0.004)/0.0763.Measurement of Lipid Peroxide The FOX II assay was used to quantify lipid peroxides, LOOHs (Jiang et al., 1992; Gay and Gebicki, 2003) according to John and Hasenstein (2018) such that (OD560 − 0.1305)/0.0383, determines the BHT equivalent in nM.Catalase Activity Catalase activity was determined from the decrease of OD240 of H2O2 for 180 s (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Based on 100 mg samples, enzyme activity was expressed as μM × min–1 × mg protein–1.Consumption of Reduced Glutathione The consumption of GSH was measured as described earlier (John and Hasenstein, 2018). The assay was modified after (Starlin and Gopalakrishnan, 2013). Samples (100 mg DW equivalent) were extracted in chilled sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, pH 7, 2 mL) and centrifuged (23,000 g, 12 min, 4°C). 500 μL supernatant was transferred into a fresh centrifuge tube, mixed with 400 μL 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 μL 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma, S-2002), 200 μL DI water, and vortexed. After adding 200 μL (4 mM) GSH (Cayman chemical company, 10007461) and 100 μL 2.5 mM H2O2, the solution was mixed and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company, 76-03-9). The solution was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged (23,000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 1.5 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1 mL 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma, D8130). After inversion, OD 409 was determined. Enzyme activity is reported as μM GSH consumed min–1 × mg protein–1.Protein Determination Protein content for the enzyme assays was determined according to Bradford (1976) using ovalbumin (Sigma, A-5378) as standard.Fatty Acid Analysis Fatty acids were extracted from tissue equivalent to 100 mg fresh weight, derivatized to their methyl esters, and quantified (John and Hasenstein, 2018) using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE, United States) gas chromatograph (6890) with mass selective detector (5973). One μL samples were injected and separated on a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5MS column with hydrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1. The temperature profile started at 100°C for 2 min, ramped (10°C × min–1) to 280°C and held for another 8 min. Identification of compounds was based on the National Institute of Science and Technology library 2008 in Chemstation software (E.02.02.1431). The quantity of individual fatty acids was determined based on retention time and slope of derivatized palmitic acid (Sigma, P-5917; Rt = 11.7 min; 3.98 × 106 TIC ng–1), linoleic acid (Sigma, L1376; Rt = 13.3 min, 3.53 × 106 TIC ng–1), linolenic acid (Cayman Chemical Company, 90210; Rt = 13.37 min; 2.51 × 106 TIC ng–1), oleic acid (Sigma, O1630; Rt = 13.4 min; 1.88 × 106 TIC ng–1), and stearic acid (Sigma, S-4751; Rt = 13.6 min; 3.05 × 106 TIC ng–1). Tissue samples were analyzed under identical conditions as standards.Statistical Analysis The data are reported as means of three to six biological replicates obtained from individual fronds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was performed using Excel data analysis tool pack (Microsoft Corporation, 2016).Results Morphological Response Pinnae of dried Pleopeltis fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature treatment (Figures 2A–C). Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration. Exposure to 55°C resulted in patchy browning along the mid-rib (rachis) of the frond (Figure 2D); after 60°C fronds were slightly (Figure 2E) and after 65°C completely discolored (Figure 2F). Submersed (Figure 2G) and partly submersed (Figure 2J) fronds showed no effects at 30°C but after exposure > 40°C submersed (Figures 2H,I) and partly submersed (Figures 2K,L) fronds showed browning. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Response of dehydrated (A,B,C), submersed (G,H,I), and partly submersed (J,K,L) fronds to 24 h heating at 30, 40, and 50°C, and fronds re-hydrated after exposure to 55, 60, and 65°C (D,E,F). Exposure to ≥ 40°C resulted in tight curling of dehydrated fronds and browning of the hydrated fronds. Re-hydrated fronds show discoloration near the rachis between 55 and 60°C and complete discoloration of the frond after 65°C. Scale bar = 1 cm.Photosynthetic Performance Dried Frond Instantaneous fluorescence (Ft) of treated dried fronds measured lower than (control) dry fronds at 25°C (Figure 3A) while Qy of fronds exposed to 30°C and higher was not detectable (Figure 3B). Interestingly, Ft of 65°C treated samples was higher than 60°C and not different from control (Figure 3A), whereas Qy even after rehydration remained undetectable (Figure 3B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll fluorescence, Ft (A,C,E) and Qy (B,D,F) data of dry, re-hydrated, partially, and fully submersed Pleopeltis fronds after 24 h exposure to different temperatures. Control values ± SE @ 25°C for Ft and Qy of dry fronds are indicated by dashed lines (A,B) and for rehydrated fronds by dotted lines (A–F). The Ft and Qy of heat-treated, dry samples are compared with 25°C dry samples (A,B); dried fronds did not show measurable Qy values regardless of temperature. Re-hydrated and hydrated samples are compared with 25°C fresh samples (C–F). Significant differences between controls and treatments are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6.Re-hydrated Fronds After rehydration, the chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) increased over time and reached control levels within 5 h for temperatures up to 35°C (Figure 3A). However, exposure to higher temperatures (≤55°C) required a recovery period of 24 h. Despite the high Ft values, the Qy decreased with higher temperatures (Figure 3B). Ft of 1-h re-hydrated fronds was low compared to (fresh) control but measurable at all temperature ranges, i.e., 30–65°C (Figure 3A). However, the Qy value decreased from 30 to 50°C and was not detectable at > 50°C (Figure 3B). Similarly, Ft of fronds re-hydrated for 5 h after less than 40°C showed values similar to (fresh) controls (Figure 3A) but Ft was lower in rehydrated fronds exposed to ≥ 45° [F(5,30) = 18, P < 0.0001]. The Qy of 5 h re-hydrated fronds was lower than in controls [F(8,45) = 37.5, P < 0.0001] but greater than after 1 h re-hydration [F(1,94) = 55.8, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3B). Beyond 45°C, Qy efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature (Figure 3B); there was no recovery after exposure to 65°C. Based on these data, Qy is a better indicator of sensing heat than Ft.Hydrated Fronds Despite some increase after 30 and 40°C treatments, Ft of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°C [F(2,15) = 312, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3C); in contrast Qy was already significantly reduced at 40°C [F(1,10) = 217, P < 0.0001] (Figure 3D). After recovery (at room temperature for 24 h), Ft and Qy of 30 and 35°C treated samples did not differ from controls (Figures 3C,D). However, in 40°C treated samples Qy remained significantly lower than base-line values [F(1,10) = 711.6, P < 0.0001], which suggests that hydration is beneficial for samples exposed to temperatures below 40°C. Unchanging but measurable Ft values in ≥ 45°C fronds and the lack of recovery of Qy after 40°C indicates degradation of PS II. In fully submersed samples, chlorophyll fluorescence was higher but Qy suppression was stronger than in partly submersed fronds (Figure 3F). All heat-stressed samples showed reduced Ft values after the recovery period, indicating that chlorophyll degradation continues during this time. The Qy values of ≥ 40°C treated samples remained undetectable (Figure 3F). Overall, the samples exposed to ≥ 40°C showed a response similar to partially submersed fronds. The data clearly show that hydration renders the photosynthetic apparatus more sensitive to heat stress than dried fronds. Importantly, the similarity between partial and full hydration suggests that reduced gas exchange in submersed fronds is not the cause of the decline of Qy.Ion Leakage To assess the response of cell membranes to heat stress, we measured the conductivity of external water from partly and fully submersed samples treated between 30 and 50°C (Figure 4). Although the fronds were washed before the experiments to minimize surface contamination, the conductivity (normalized to 10 mL) at 30 and 35°C were not different from controls, did not differ between partly and fully submersed samples, and likely represents surface-bound ions or normal ion exchange. However, treatment of ≥ 40°C strongly increased the conductivity of fully and partly submersed fronds, indicating membrane leakiness (Figure 4). There was no reduction in conductivity after 24 h recovery at RT (Figure 4); thus, there was no re-uptake of ions during the recovery phase. The conductivities of submersed samples were higher than those of partly submersed samples (Figure 4). The ion concentration was clearly dependent on the extent of immersion, indicating that long-distance transport did not contribute to the ion release. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Electrolyte leakage measured as conductivity of external water after 24 h at various temperatures and after a 24 h recovery period at RT. Differences in conductivity between heat treated and 25°C control are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6.Elemental analysis of the leachate revealed that K+ is the major released ion followed by Ca+2 and S (Figure 5). Na+ and Mg2+ were present at lower quantities. K+ and S in the leachate increased with temperature and both elements showed the largest increase at 40°C (Figure 5). Ca+2 loss occurred more evenly across the tested temperature range and like Na+ did not show a distinct threshold temperature (Figure 5). Unlike partly submersed samples, the ions from submersed fronds did not increase beyond 40°C, which indicates that membrane damage occurs at that temperature. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Elemental analysis of leachate from partially (hatched bars) and fully submersed (solid bars) Pleopeltis fronds. Significant differences between heat treated and 25°C control are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 3.Reducing Capacity Generic reducing capacity represents overall metabolic activity. Dried fronds showed significantly lower activity than hydrated tissue [F(4,25) = 19.6, P < 0.0001] below 45°C but their reducing capacity exceeded that of submersed tissue at higher temperatures (Figure 6) regardless of the type of submersion. Despite declining reducing capacity of dried fronds at elevated temperatures, dried fronds showed metabolic activity. Likewise, the reducing capacity remained higher in partly than in fully submersed fronds [F(1,10) = 4.9, P = 0.05] (Figure 6). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Reduction of resazurin in dried fronds and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) fronds exposed to heat for 24 h. The metabolic activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 6.Hydroperoxides The hydroperoxide content of dried fronds increased gradually with temperature and reached a maximum at 40°C (Figure 7). Fully and partly submersed fronds responded similarly and showed their highest values at 35°C (Figure 7). Higher temperatures led to a decrease on peroxides that was less in dried than in submersed fronds. The moderate increase in dry but stronger increase in hydrated fronds suggests that peroxide accumulates during heat stress but declines when the stress exceeds the metabolic capacity. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Hydroperoxide content in dried, fully, or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to various temperatures for 24 h. The content from heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4.Lipid Hydroperoxides The LOOH pattern was similar to hydroperoxides; dried fronds showed a steady increase with temperature with a maximum at 40°C [F(4,15) = 3.7, P = 0.03] (Figure 8). Partly and fully submersed samples reached their maximum at 35°C but showed lower levels of LOOH than dried fronds at 45 and 50°C (Figure 8), likely related to damaged metabolism, which weakens the response. Therefore, similar to the hydroperoxide profile, the maximum LOOH values signal the onset of non-compensated, i.e., damaging, heat stress. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) content in dried and fully or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The content from heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4.Catalase Activity The greatest difference between dried and fresh tissue was measured at 25°C (Figure 9). Dried fronds showed their highest CAT activity at 30°C but the decline at higher temperatures was less than in hydrated fronds [F(2,57) = 3.1, P = 0.05]. Like dry fronds, submersed fronds showed a steady decline in CAT activity and the extent of submersion had no effect (Figure 9). Because CAT activity in dried fronds was significantly higher after 30°C treatment than at 25°C and significantly reduced in hydrated fronds at 35°C, CAT activity was higher in hydrated vs. dried tissue. CAT activity is remarkably temperature sensitive and the decline at 35°C indicates a stress response of CAT-linked processes. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Catalase activity in dried and fully or partly submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4.Glutathione (GSH) Consumption Glutathione consumption responded stronger to desiccation than heat stress [F(2,57) = 363, P < 0.0001] (Figure 10). GSH consumption in dried fronds decreased at ≥ 45°C [F(1,6) = 13.3, P = 0.01] compared to 30–40°C treated samples (Figure 10). GSH consumption of hydrated fronds showed a similar reduction and the extent of submersion had no effect. GSH utilization of 30°C dried and hydrated samples did not differ from the respective 25°C controls. FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab H2O2-dependent glutathione oxidation activity in dried and partially and fully submersed Pleopeltis fronds exposed to different temperatures for 24 h. The activity of heat treated dry and hydrated fronds is compared with 25°C dry and fresh (control), respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by ∗ (P ≤ 0.05); means ± SE, n = 4.Fatty Acid (FA) Profile Temperature stress changed the FA composition and quantity in all samples. The total FA content in dehydrated fronds increased up to 35°C but decreased at higher temperatures (Figure 11A). In partly and fully submersed fronds, the total fatty acid reached its peak at 30°C and declined at higher temperatures (Figures 11B,C); the FA content in 50°C treated dried and hydrated samples was 76% and 90% lower than 30°C treated fronds, respectively (Figure 11). FIGURE 11. Open in a new tab FA profiles in dried (A), partly submersed (B), and fully submersed (C) fronds after exposure to various temperatures for 24 h. 16:0 = palmitic acid; 18:0 = stearic acid; 18:1 = oleic acid; 18:2 = linoleic acid; 18:3 = linolenic acid. Significance levels are based on the FA content of 25°C dry and hydrated fronds, respectively. Significant differences between treated and controls are indicated by * (P ≤ 0.05) and ◆ (P ≤ 0.001); means ± SE, n = 4.Palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acid were detected in controls and heat-treated fronds but linolenic acid (18:3) was the dominant FA at all temperatures and the total amount of fatty acids in fully submersed fronds was higher than in dried and partly submersed samples (Figure 11). The extent of unsaturation correlated with peroxidation; therefore, we examined the degree of unsaturation for each temperature. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (18:1, 18:2, 18:3) in 30°C, dried and partly submersed samples was 12 and 5% lower than at 25°C (Figure 11). Exposure to temperatures higher than 30°C decreased unsaturation, especially in partly submersed samples (Figure 11 and Supplementary Table 1). Regardless of the hydration condition, after exposure to temperatures of 45°C and higher, all FAs showed reduced but equal quantities. In general, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids was higher in dried than in hydrated fronds; and declined in dried fronds above 40°C; this reduction began in hydrated fronds at 35°C.Discussion Our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. As stated under section “Materials and Methods,” it is important to reiterate the arbitrary nature of the study. The problematic aspects include the duration of the temperature treatment and the testing of various processes and enzymatic activities. It is unlikely that in nature temperatures greater than 40°C extend for more than 12 h. Nonetheless, heat tolerance was tested previously for an equally arbitrary time of 30 min, which resulted in tolerance of > 100°C (Lange, 1955). While evaporative cooling likely provides some protection during short-term heat exposure, our heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. Similarly, submersion of fronds eliminates water stress but may cause different stress for the epiphytic Pleopletis as was shown by the lower reducing capacity (Figure 6) and reduced Qy (Figure 3F) of completely vs. partially submersed fronds (Figure 3D). This sensitivity may be the result of reduced gas exchange (Voesenek et al., 2006), or the enhanced activity of symbiotic surface organisms (Koch and Barthlott, 2009); both phenomena can lead to anoxia (Blokhina et al., 2003; Banti et al., 2010). Nonetheless, the differences between the submersion treatments illustrate the sensitivity of the fronds to different conditions and allow for nuanced evaluation of heat effects. Stress response includes changes in morphology, cellular functions, metabolism, and ultimately gene expression. Because of the reduced metabolism under dry conditions, it is likely that dry tissue shows reduced susceptibility to heat damage. The co-variance between desiccation and heat may induce changes in cell wall and thus frond shape (Wu et al., 2018) a suitable indicator for heat stress of dry material (Figure 2). However, fronds expanded even after exposure to 65°C; therefore, heat stress cannot be assessed solely through changes in shape or color. Changes in Frond Shape and Color In response to increasing temperature, dehydrated Pleopeltis fronds became thinner, pinnae curled tighter (Figures 2B,C), and after exposure to ≥ 45°C fronds became brittle. Such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall polymers (Lima et al., 2013). These changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores (Ballesteros et al., 2017). Among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall (Willats et al., 2001) and heat sensitivity (Lima et al., 2013). Loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation (Willats et al., 2001; Bethke et al., 2016). Pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temperatures, but further research is needed to assess the status of pectin in the cell wall of dried Pleopeltis fronds. Fronds exposed to 30–50°C fully expanded upon rehydration (at 25°C) and did not show necrosis, or changes in shape of the fronds (data not shown). Discolorations of hydrated fronds after exposure to ≥ 35°C (Figures 2E–I) and re-hydrated fronds after exposure to > 55°C (Figure 2) indicate that these fronds have experienced stress beyond their thermal tolerance resulting in chloroplast or chlorophyll degradation, which eventually leads to senescence (Jespersen et al., 2016) and programmed cell death (PCD) (Qu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015). One of the key enzymes known to regulate the breakdown of chlorophyll is pheophytinase (Schelbert et al., 2009). It is possible that the activity of this enzyme increases at high temperatures, similar to observations in bentgrass (Jespersen et al., 2016). Stress-induced chlorophyll degradation is also affected by ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and ROS (Xu and Huang, 2007). These compounds also influence PS II-mediated electron transport (Xu and Huang, 2007; Griffiths et al., 2014), and membrane-bound ion channels (Demidchik, 2018), proteins, and lipids (Veerasamy et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2014). Based on browning, our morphological data indicate that 40°C is the threshold for heat damage for hydrated Pleopeltis fronds (Figures 2E–I); in contrast, dried fronds can tolerate > 60°C (Figure 2).Photosynthetic Susceptibility Dried Fronds Fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) of dried fronds were lower than in fresh fronds but readily detectable (Figures 3A,B), indicating that drying decreases but not completely blocks photosynthetic activity. After dry fronds were exposed to > 50°C, Qy was undetectable (Figure 3B) and Ft decreased (Figure 3A) suggesting that the PS II system responds to stress and is blocked by heat (Yamada et al., 1996). This disruption likely protects the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage. Interestingly, after exposure to 65°C, Ft was higher than after 60°C exposure or in non-heat-treated, dry fronds (Figure 3A), suggesting that extreme temperatures (i.e., 65°C) lead to the disintegration of the photosynthetic reaction center (Wise et al., 2004; Kadir et al., 2007) but chlorophyll fluorescence persists. Thus, based on the Ft and Qy data, the photosynthetic apparatus in dry fronds is heat-tolerant up to 60°C. The photosynthetic apparatus adjusts to stress in several ways, including elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which can lead to increases in Zeaxanthin and other pigments even under dark conditions (Brüggemann et al., 2009; Leuenberger et al., 2017) and ROS (Ramel et al., 2012). Thus, pigment metabolism may be an important element of stress response. The recovery of the photosynthetic performances (Ft and Qy) following re-hydration was time dependent. Qy values of fronds exposed to 30°C reached control values within 5 h of re-hydration but required at least 24 h in fronds exposed to higher temperatures (Figure 3B). The slow recovery of Qy performance indicates that heat exerts long-term stress on the PS II system, likely by interfering with the water oxidation complex (Srivastava et al., 1997) and/or PS II energy transfer (Kadir et al., 2007). Fronds re-hydrated after 60°C appeared photosynthetically functional but at significantly reduced efficiency (Figures 3A,B), which suggests that repair processes are damaged (Allakhverdiev et al., 2008). Photosynthetic activity (Qy) in re-hydrated fronds after 65°C was not detectable (Figure 3B), and indicates irreversible damage (Kadir et al., 2007). Thus, similar to morphological data, Ft and Qy measurements indicate that the maximal heat tolerance of dehydrated Pleopeltis is 60°C. These data indicate that chlorophyll and/or the reaction center remain intact in spite of absence of PS II activity. The lack of photosynthetic activity may protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage.Hydrated Fronds Ft and Qy of partly and fully submersed (Figures 3C–F) fronds exposed to ≤ 35°C were not affected. However, at 40°C, Qy decreased while Ft increased. Similar to observations in dried tissue, this unequal response indicates a dichotomy between chlorophyll stability and reduced photosynthetic efficiency, possibly as a result from inactivation of the oxygen evolving system (Wise et al., 2004) and/or the PS II reaction center (Bolharnordenkampe et al., 1989). The reduction of Ft at > 40°C and non-detectable Qy (Figures 3D,F) indicates that the fronds become photosynthetically non-functional beyond 40°C and identifies the thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds as 40°C.Electrolyte Leakage An increase in conductivity of the external medium indicates cell membrane damage and efflux of ions (Ilik et al., 2018). High conductivity in fully submersed samples relative to partly submersed suggests that the integrity of the membrane is affected by the combination of heat and extent of immersion. Further, the absence of gas exchange seems to negatively impact membrane stability, especially at temperatures > 35°C. Low conductivity in partly and fully submersed samples at ≤ 35°C and no difference from the control likely represents regular ion exchange in intact membranes that is maintained until about 35°C (Figure 4A). During the ensuing 24 h recovery period, the (slight) decrease in conductivity suggests at least partial reuptake of ions (Figure 4B). Since re-absorption is an active process, it is likely that this process is dependent on the activity of plasma membrane proton ATPase, which is reported to be activated by the combination of high temperature and resulting membrane lipid modification (Viegas et al., 1995). Leaching from leaves is broadly defined as removal of substances from plant leaves by action of rain, fog, dew, and washing (Tukey, 1970). Other factors such as stress, water content, nutrient availability, and physical characteristics of the tissue also influence the extent of leaching (Tukey, 1970). In partly submersed samples, presence of relatively lower amount of water and interaction of vapor mixture with the tissue surface may contribute to leaching. Additionally, since Pleopeltis fronds readily absorb water (John and Hasenstein, 2017), it is likely that water permeability contributes to ion loss. The higher quantity of ions in the leachate (Figure 5) and high conductivity (Figure 4) in fully submersed samples compared to partly submersed samples is likely proportional to the extent a submersion but indicates the deleterious effect of heat on membrane stability. The most abundant ion found in the leachate was K+ (Figure 5) consistent with its vital role in the osmoregulation (Cochrane and Cochrane, 2009). Loss of ions in general likely triggers ROS production that leads to oxidative stress and eventually cell death (Demidchik et al., 2014). Taken together, photosynthetic data (Figure 3) and cation leakage (Figure 4) suggest that thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds is 40°C.Metabolism Metabolically active cells rely on a steady supply of reduced compounds; therefore, the concentration of reduction equivalents is a measure of metabolic health. However, assessing the metabolic status of dried Pleopeltis through aqueous redox dyes is problematic because tissue rehydrates in the dye solution. Therefore, our data report the reduction capacity of dried fronds immediately after hydration. Nonetheless, the temperature and hydration variability of the data indicates that the measurements provide a meaningful estimate of the reduction capacity. The declining reducing capacity with increasing temperatures (Figure 6) is likely the result of diminished electron transport (Hüve et al., 2011)and uncoupled photosynthetic electron transport (Sharkey and Zhang, 2010; Awasthi et al., 2015). Because metabolic activity of dried fronds was detectable, dehydrated Pleopeltis remain metabolically active up to at 40°C (Figure 6). Metabolic changes in desiccated moss tissue resulted in a glassy state only after rapid desiccation where enzymatic reactions were absent. In contrast, slow drying achieved a “rubbery state” (Fernandez-Marin et al., 2013). We assume that the slow drying of Pleopeltis and its maintained flexibility is indicative of a non-glassy state with reduced metabolism. Hydrated fronds showed higher metabolic activity than dried fronds up to 40°C (Figure 6) but similar values at higher temperatures. This observation corresponds to the heat sensitivity of imbibed seeds, which deteriorate at high temperature compared to dried seeds (Hill and Johnstone, 1985). The metabolism of hydrated fronds is similar to the photosynthetic performance (Figures 3C–F) and is similar to the thermotolerance of other tropical and sub-tropical plants (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014). Exposure of plants to heat loads beyond their tolerance level leads to senescence, necrotic symptoms (Figures 2E–I), or apoptosis (Reape and McCabe, 2008). Apoptosis or PCD is typically estimated by the loss of metabolic functions (as in Figure 6) and characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and breakup of a cell into small apoptotic bodies (van Doorn et al., 2011). In contrast, necrosis is characterized as a chaotic and uncontrolled form of cell death that involves early rupture of the plasma membrane (van Doorn et al., 2011) and confined swelling of the cell (Reape et al., 2008). Viability stains can assess overall cell health but cannot distinguish between PCD and necrosis (Reape et al., 2008). To determine the type of cell death that occurs in Pleopeltis in response to heat stress, examination of endomembranes, nuclease activity, and DNA integrity would be essential, as has been shown in carrot (McCabe et al., 1997) and tobacco cells (Burbridge et al., 2006).Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities The increase of ROS (Figure 7) in dry and hydrated fronds suggests that Pleopeltis experiences oxidative stress (Ali et al., 2005; Awasthi et al., 2015). The decline of ROS for hydrated but not dried fronds at > 40°C indicates that dehydrated fronds are capable of coping with elevated ROS at higher temperatures than hydrated fronds. The high levels of peroxides at 40°C (Figures 7, 8) also support heat tolerance to about 40°C. Pleopeltis, like most plants, responds to heat by enhanced production of ROS (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014), which in turn activate signal transduction and ultimately defense mechanisms and PCD (Burbridge et al., 2006). Therefore, the decrease of hydroperoxide (Figure 7) and lipid hydroperoxide (Figure 8) above 40°C indicates damaging, possibly lethal, shifts in the redox equilibrium (Foyer and Noctor, 2005; Suzuki et al., 2012). In addition to elevated ROS, the decreased availability of antioxidants or activity of reducing enzymes likely enhances ROS toxicity. CAT, an important enzyme for the detoxification of H2O2, is sensitive to elevated temperatures (Figure 9) and has been reported to decline upon dehydration (John and Hasenstein, 2018). The heat correlated reduction of CAT activity suggests that CAT is unable to detoxify ROS as also reported by Ali et al. (2005). Reduced CAT activity and high amounts of hydroperoxides may lead to an oxidative environment that then enhances consumption of GSH, a phenomenon also observed in Arabidopsis (Queval et al., 2011) and barley mutants (Smith et al., 1985) that lack CAT activity. GSH-oxidation increases during dehydration (John and Hasenstein, 2018) and heat-stressed, dried fronds maintain their high GSH levels up to 40°C (Figure 10). Thus, GSH oxidizing enzymes have greater heat tolerance than CAT. It is also possible that the accumulation of the oxidized form of GSH (GSSG) in chloroplasts and vacuoles (Queval et al., 2011) is important for redox regulation, especially during stress (Smith et al., 1985; Tommasini et al., 1993). Hydrated fronds accumulate high levels of hydro- (Figure 7) and lipid hydroperoxide (Figure 8) up to 40°C. These stress indicators could be a response to electrolyte leakage (Figure 4), as reported for bentgrass (Liu and Huang, 2000). However, unlike bentgrass which showed increased lipid peroxide and electrolyte leakage, Pleopeltis exhibited increased electrolyte leakage (Figure 4) but LOOH content decreased at > 40°C (Figure 8), which could result from interactions between peroxide (Figure 7) and membrane-bound unsaturated fatty acids (Figures 11B,C) (Blokhina et al., 2003). These results suggest that (hydrated) Pleopeltis membranes are affected even by temperatures below ≤ 40°C. Because CAT (Figure 9) and GSH consuming enzymes (Figure 10) may protect membranes, further research is needed to determine temperature effects on membrane integrity.Fatty Acids Stress-responsive metabolites in plants include fatty acids (Su et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2011; Ahmad et al., 2013). Our data confirm this notion because the FA composition of Pleopeltis fronds changes with temperature and hydration (Figure 11). Increasing temperature reduces desaturation and overall FA quantity, which indicates that heat interferes with either fatty acid synthesis and/or stimulates fatty acid breakdown. On average, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in dried fronds was higher than in hydrated fronds (Supplementary Table 1), which may protect the temperature sensitive photosynthetic apparatus (Gombos et al., 1994). Additionally, unsaturation declined in dried fronds at temperatures > 40 and > 35°C in hydrated fronds (Figure 11), suggesting that heat stress increases saturation of fatty acids. Saturated FAs reduce membrane fluidity and enhance integrity (Ahmad et al., 2013; Sakhno et al., 2014). Both parameters are important for surviving high temperatures (Murata and Los, 1997; Upchurch, 2008). Additionally, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid makes membranes susceptible to peroxidation (Liu and Huang, 2004), which corresponds to our observation of higher LOOH in heat-stressed, dry fronds compared with hydrated fronds (Figure 8). Although saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 18:0) made up a small fraction of the total fatty acid pool (Figure 11), their presence likely contributes to membrane stability and heat tolerance (Liu and Huang, 2004; Ahmad et al., 2013). The decline of all fatty acids at elevated temperatures (Figure 11) links the fatty acid content to senescence (Koiwai et al., 1981; Yang and Ohlrogge, 2009). Even though senescence is not detectable in dried fronds, high amounts of lipid hydroperoxides (Figure 8) imply that dehydrated fronds are also affected by heat-induced membrane damage. The sensitivity of FA spectra to temperature and hydration indicates that FA profiling can be an effective stress indicator. Future studies will decipher how the FA profile changes with the extent and duration of stress, and during recovery. Dried material undergoes metabolic reactions of lipids (Golovina et al., 2010) and longevity has been attributed to “differences in the structure or mobility of molecules within the solidified cytoplasm” (Ballesteros et al., 2017). The remaining elasticity of dried Pleopeltis fronds suggests that they are below the glass transition threshold and therefore capable of low-level metabolism. The changing levels of FAs are indicative of ongoing metabolism in tissue with low water content (Figure 11). One could speculate that the stress response to drying includes enhanced lipid biosynthesis (Quartacci et al., 2002) to maintain membrane fluidity (Murata and Los, 1997; Ahmad et al., 2013) and that elevated temperatures enhance respiration such that beta oxidation of FAs leads to their lowered content. Future studies will analyze the time course of these rather drastic changes, and how the FA profile changes during recovery.Conclusion The mechanism of Pleopeltis response to heat stress is complex. Our biochemical data indicate that > 40°C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds. Despite obvious stress signals, dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55°C while thermo-tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40°C. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects Pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress.Data Availability Statement The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author Contributions SJ and KH conceived the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
