    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.

    "introduction": "Introduction Alterations in the gravity vector and exposure to ionizing radiation can disrupt skeletal homeostasis in mice1–3. There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss4–6. Decrements in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in astronauts from the Mir missions as well as missions to the International Space Station (ISS)7–9. While much research has focused on the detrimental effects of microgravity on skeletal tissue, less is known about the impact of spaceflight radiation. Crewed missions have, to this point, primarily remained within low-Earth orbit (LEO). While sources of ionizing space radiation within LEO include galactic cosmic radiation and charged particles from unpredictable solar particle events (SPE)10,11, the presence of the Earth’s magnetosphere reduces exposure to ionizing space radiation. Missions beyond LEO pose the greatest risk of radiation exposure and is of significant concern for crew health12–14. Spaceflight-relevant radiation includes a mix of low-linear energy transfer (LET) species such as protons and helium ions as well as high-LET species such as iron15,16. Beyond LEO, for example, astronauts may be exposed to up to 0.7 Sv of ionizing radiation12,15,17 during a multi-year mission to the Moon or Mars14,15,18. On Earth, bone homeostasis is effectively maintained by the controlled remodeling activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, exposure to low-LET radiation (137Cs or X-ray, 1–2 Gy) leads to a transient increase in the number of osteoclasts, accompanied by an increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and decrease in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), overall leading to a reduction in bone volume fraction (BV/TV)19–22. Together, this early increase in bone resorption and decrease in bone formation due to radiation exposure can result in a state of osteopenia, potentially leading to an increased risk of bone fracture16,23,24. A possible mechanism of action responsible for these changes in bone homeostasis is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to radiation exposure2,25. Furthermore, reduction of antioxidant defense mechanisms26,27 and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines16,28 have been associated with altered redox-balance due to radiation exposure. Together, these critical changes in cellular signaling lead to compromised bone strength and increased fracture risk25,29. Due to the involvement of redox-signaling in radiation-induced bone loss, antioxidants have been considered as candidate countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced bone loss30. Proposed mechanisms by which antioxidants exert protective effects include the quenching of ROS via an increase in antioxidant activity and decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling cascades29. Dried plum, Prunus domestica L., has been shown to have beneficial effects against bone loss31 (reviewed in Wallace et al. 2017). Dried plum’s positive effects on bone health markers have been investigated in multiple models of osteopenia, in both human clinical trials32–36 and rodent studies37,38. While the mechanism of action of dried plum is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that the high antioxidant capacity and high polyphenolic content of this fruit scavenges free-radicals as well as promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption39–42. Our lab has reported that mice fed a diet composed of Dried Plum (DP) prevented cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation (IR), both low-LET such as gamma (137Cs) and a mixture of both low-LET and high-LET (sequential beam of proton, 1H and iron, 56Fe). The proposed mechanism for DP’s protective effect is via the prevention of radiation-induced increases in markers of bone resorption, inflammation and oxidative stress43. Since the spaceflight environment includes exposure to both IR and microgravity, we sought to extend our hypothesis that DP could be a countermeasure for both radiation- and microgravity-induced bone loss. The current literature indicates that simulated microgravity and IR each have detrimental effects on cancellous bone structure, although there is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and IR cause additive or synergistic effects when combined20,44,45. Thus, more studies are needed to determine whether combining simulated microgravity and IR leads to cumulative effects compared to simulated microgravity and IR alone. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents46. This model allows for a simulation of the cephalad fluid shift47 and removal of load-bearing forces typically experienced by the hindlimbs, which can lead to increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and decreased numbers of bone-forming osteoblasts48. Together, these events result in bone loss as well as reduced bone mechanical properties in rodents49–52. In addition, exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors53,54. The bone marrow niche contains osteoblast progenitors cells4 and it has been shown that exposure to microgravity alters the cells proliferation capacity and impairs their ability to produce extracellular matrix, in turn inhibiting the maturation of the bone matrix. Thus, the ability to maintain bone homeostasis is diminished16,54–56. To address these knowledge gaps related to spaceflight-induced bone loss and candidate countermeasures, we sought to evaluate the potentially distinct effects of microgravity and ionizing radiation when applied independently, or in combination. For this study, we utilized the HU model and exposure to total body irradiation (137Cs gamma radiation, at 2 Gy dose) as analogs of weightlessness and radiation exposure, respectively. A relatively high dose of radiation (2 Gy) was chosen as a positive control dose to ensure bone loss in rodents and to allow for testing of DP as a countermeasure, as previously described43. We sought to determine whether DP diet prevents simulated microgravity-induced bone loss alone, and in combination with radiation, as compared to respective control diet controls. We also assessed the ability of DP to mitigate simulated weightlessness- and/or radiation-induced changes to the axial skeleton57, specifically the lumbar 4 (L4) vertebrae. We analyzed both cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. Additionally, we determined whether the DP diet had the capacity to protect osteoprogenitors after exposure to simulated microgravity, an essential part in the healthy maintenance of skeletal tissue.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals and treatments Male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) at 14 weeks of age were weight matched, assigned to groups (n = 10/group), and individually housed in standard vivarium cages or custom-designed HU cages as previously described46. Our justification for using mice of this age is that they are considered skeletally mature at the time of initiating treatment (HU and/or IR) so that the effects of HU and/or IR on the 16 week old mice can be attributed to dietary effects on the adult, rather than rather than on the growing skeleton. We have extensive previous reports showing this age and duration of HU and IR treatment yields the predicted bone loss (45,57,68–70). 14 week old mice were used to allow for a 2 week pre-feeding period. Two weeks of prefeeding period was selected to provide sufficient time for animals to adapt to the diet prior to initiating exposure to simulated spaceflight, while avoiding a lengthy pre-feeding period, which may potentially affect bone structural and/or mechanical properties prior to initiating treatments. Animals assigned to the HU group were suspended with traction tape based on previously established procedures46,71. The room conditions was maintained at an average 73.3°F, 31% humidity, 12 hours light/dark cycle), with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal weights (Supplementary table 1) were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment to asses health of the mice. The NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Diets Two diets were used for this study: The control diet (CD) was a defined formulation (AIN93M, Teklad, Madison, WI) while the DP diet was composed of the AIN93M diet supplemented with 25% by weight dried plum powder (from the California Dried Plum Board) and was compounded by Teklad as described previously35,37,38,43,58,72,73. Experimental protocol Animals were pre-fed with either CD or DP diet for a period of 14 days in standard vivarium cages prior to undergoing sham-unloading or HU. Animals undergoing HU were allowed to acclimate to their new cage environment three days prior to initiating HU. Initiation of HU was considered to be day 0 of the experiment (Fig. 1, panel b). Sham-unloaded animals were handled similarly to HU mice, without undergoing actual tail suspension, followed by housing in NL conditions in vivarium cages. On day 3, animals were either exposed to sham-irradiation or total body IR. Mice were fed their respective diets until time of euthanasia (day 14). At time of euthanasia, tibiae, femora, and vertebrae were collected and processed for micro-computed tomography (microCT) or ex vivo cell culture. Radiation exposure At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to 2 Gy Gamma of whole-body IR (137Cs at 0.83 Gy/min, JL Shepherd Mark I, San Gabriel, CA) as used in Schreurs et al.43. For this treatment, mice were housed individually in a custom animal holding cage, maintaining HU mice in a head-down position. Mice were placed in the irradiator chamber and exposed to TBI. The unloading of mice was maintained during irradiation by custom small HU cages. Sham-irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off. MicroCT At the time of sample collection, tibiae were cut distal to the tibio-fibular junction (TFJ) to allow complete infiltration of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, Sigma). After 24 hours at 4 °C, samples were transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage. The day before imaging, bones were rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco 1×, pH 7.4). MicroCT was then conducted using SkyScan 1272 (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with a 0.25 mm aluminum filter, x-ray tube potential of 60 kV and x-ray intensity of 166 μA. For the analysis of cancellous bone, scans were performed with a resolution of 3.5 μm/voxel resolution (integration time = 840 ms, frame averaging = 3, rotation step = 0.600°). A 1.0mm-thick region of cancellous bone located 0.5 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and auto-contoured as detailed by Buie et al.74, with minor modifications (SkyScan, CT Analyzer). From this auto-contouring program, bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm) were calculated to assess bone microarchitecture and reported following conventional guidelines75. An automated contouring program was used to select and measure the microarchitecture of the cortical shell surrounding the abovementioned cancellous region. From this auto-contouring program, cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm) and cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, mm2) were calculated. To assess microarchitecture of the cortical compartment of the distal tibia, bones were scanned with a resolution of 12μm/voxel (integration time = 420 ms, frame averaging = 3, rotation step = 0.400°), and a 0.3 mm thick region located 2 mm proximal to the TFJ was selected and auto-contoured. Cortical parameters of interest included periosteal (Peri.P,mm) and endosteal (Endo.P, mm) perimeters, cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), mean polar moment of inertia (J, mm4), cortical bone volume (BV, mm3), marrow volume (mm3), marrow area (mm2), and volumetric tissue mineral density (TMD, g/cm3). Calcium hydroxyapatite phantoms (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) were utilized to validate TMD by converting linear-attenuation coefficient of the material to TMD of the phantom75. MicroCT analysis was also performed on the fourth lumbar (L4) vertebrae. Before scanning, vertebrae were processed to remove all transverse processes that project posteriorly in preparation for mechanical testing, as detailed below76. If a vertebral body was at all compromised during sample preparation, sample was removed from further analysis. Vertebrae were then scanned at 6μm/voxel resolution (integration time = 840 ms, frame averaging = 2, rotation step = 0.600°). Height of the vertebrae, in millimeters, was determined using the reconstructed scans. Analysis was performed on the entire, post-processed vertebral body77. An auto-contouring program was utilized to determine total (Tt)78 vertebral body bone volume fraction (Tt.BV/TV, %), total vertebral body trabecular thickness (Tt.Tb.Th, mm), total vertebral body trabecular number (Tt.Tb.N, 1/mm), and total vertebral body trabecular separation (Tt.Tb.Sp, mm). Total vertebral body is a measure of the microarchitecture of both the cortical and cancellous bone compartments. The geometry of the cortical shell was assessed separately at the posterior side of the vertebral body, as this region displays concentrated stress during uniaxial compression57. Mechanical testing – monotonic compression The vertebral column was processed to isolate the L4 vertebra and further prepared for mechanical testing as described previously76. In brief, all soft tissue was carefully removed, and endplates and posterior elements were removed using a diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany) to isolate the vertebral body and ensure plano-parallel testing surfaces. Uniaxial compressive monotonic testing was performed as described previously76. In brief, after microCT was performed as detailed above, uniaxial compressive testing was performed at ambient temperature at a platen displacement rate of 0.01 mm/sec. Force (N) and displacement (mm) data were collected during testing (1,000 Hz; WinTest 7, version 7.01). Mechanical testing was not performed on samples in which the vertebral body was compromised during sample preparation. Thus, the sample size per group was as follows: n = 10 (CD, NL), n = 5 (CD, IR), n = 8 (CD, HU), n = 7 (CD, HU + IR), n = 8 (DP, NL), n = 6 (DP, IR), n = 9 (DP, HU), and n = 6 (DP, HU + IR). Custom MATLAB code (Version R2017a, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to analyze the data and obtain maximum load at failure (N) and stiffness (N/mm). Stiffness is defined as the force required to displace a specimen a set distance, or the slope of the specimen’s force-displacement curve. Thus, stiffness was calculated as the slope of a line that best fit the middle 80% of data points in the range between the force at displacement = 0 and maximum load (i.e. a consistently linear region of the curve for all specimens). Reported stiffness (N/strain) was normalized by the height of the vertebra, as determined by microCT (Fig. 5, panel b). Due to the variation in cross-sectional area of the vertebral body from cranial to caudal ends, the elastic modulus and ultimate stress were not calculated. Ex vivo osteoblastogenic cell culture Bone marrow cells were flushed and collected from the femur at time of euthanasia (n = 5 each for NL and HU groups). The limited number of samples per group were the result of the experimental design. Bone marrow cells were then plated at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in osteogenic media (α-MEM, FBS, Ascorbic Acid and beta-glycerophosphate), as described previously2. Media was changed every 2–3 days. On day 10 in culture, colonies consisting of at least 30 cells were scored. Colony counts were normalized to area of culture plate (3.8 cm2). Cells were grown for a total of 30 days to allow for mineralization, which was then stained using the Von Kossa method2 and quantified using ImageJ (Version 1.52a, , USA). Statistical analysis Data were presented as mean and standard deviations (S.D.). If the variances between groups were equal and parametric, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed. When a main effect by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was evident, an all pairs Tukey Kramers post-hoc analysis was performed (software JMP Version 13.0). We selected this formalism to allow for multiple and direct comparisons within each diet (CD or DP) and also across the diets (i.e CD HU + IR vs DP HU + IR) to assess our specific research objective, namely determining the efficacy of dried plum as a countermeasure of bone loss against the age-matched negative control. If the data were non-parametric, Steel or Wilcoxon post-hoc analysis was performed as needed.",
    "results": "Results Body weight Skeletally mature, male mice, 14 weeks of age, were assigned to groups (n = 10/group) and pre-fed for 14 days with either a control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP) (Fig. 1). Mice were assigned to the following groups at the start of the experiment: normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU) for a total of 14 days at 16 weeks of age, with either sham radiation or IR exposure on day 3. The experiment was completed on day 14 and samples of interest were collected (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental treatment groups and experiment design. (a) Male mice were assigned to groups (n = 10/group) and pre-fed with either a control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP). Mice were assigned to the following groups: 14 days of normally loaded conditions (NL) (Groups 1,2), hindlimb unloading (HU) alone (Groups 3,4), or HU in combination with ionizing radiation (IR), at a dose of 2 Gy 137Cs (0.8 Gy/min) (Groups 5, 6, 7, 8). (b) Mice were pre-fed with either CD or DP diets 14 days before onset of HU treatment, mice were exposed to IR 3 days after onset of HU, and samples were collected 14 days after initiation of HU treatment. At time of tissue collection (day 14), bone marrow cells were flushed from the femora’s of groups 1, 2, 3, 4 (n = 5/group) and cultured for 30 days for osteoblastogenesis (OB).Body weights were recorded during the experiment to assess the overall health of the mice. As expected, HU mice showed decrements body weights starting from day 3 until day 9, at which point the body weights stabilize (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, exposure to IR did not result in significant changes in body weights. Prevention of bone loss after exposure to simulated spaceflight Micro-computed tomography (microCT) was utilized to quantify differences in bone microarchitecture after HU, IR or the combination of both treatments. We performed this analysis on both the cancellous and cortical regions of the appendicular (i.e. tibia) and axial (i.e. vertebra) skeleton. Appendicular Skeleton Mice exposed to simulated spaceflight factors, alone or combined, and fed a DP diet did not exhibit significant deficits in cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia compared to NL control mice, whereas mice fed the CD diet showed structural deficits in cancellous microarchitecture. In CD-fed mice, exposure to IR alone led to a 20% decrease in percent bone volume (BV/TV) and a modest but statistically significant 7% increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (Fig. 2, panels a and c), but did not decrease trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), nor trabecular numbers (Tb.N) compared to NL controls (Fig. 2, panels b and d). Similarly, exposure of CD-fed mice to HU alone resulted in an 11% decrease in Tb.Th (Fig. 2, panel b), but did not significantly affect the other parameters. In CD-fed mice, the combined treatment (HU and IR) led to a 25% decrease in BV/TV, accompanied by a modest but statistically significant 9% decrease in Tb.Th as well as an 8% increase in Tb.Sp when compared to NL controls (Fig. 2). Overall, mice fed the CD diet and exposed to simulated spaceflight led to a thinning of the trabeculae and greater separation between trabeculae, leading to a significant decrease in the BV/TV within the cancellous compartment. In DP-fed mice, the combination of HU and IR led to a statistically significant decline in Tb.Th relative to HU or IR alone. Together, these results indicate both a radioprotective effect of the DP diet on BV/TV and Tb.Sp, as well as a partial protection against HU-induced trabecular thinning. Of the cancellous parameters analyzed in the tibia, there were no significant differences due to diet alone between NL mice. Representative images are shown from each group in Fig. 3, with coronal view of the tibiae (panel a) and 3D reconstruction of the cancellous volume of interest (panel b), in which the skeletal decrements due to simulated spaceflight were observed in mice fed CD diet, but not in mice fed the DP diet. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effect of DP diet on cancellous bone loss induced by simulated spaceflight. Mice were separated into groups (n = 10/group), fed specific diets (either Control Diet, CD or Dried Plum diet, DP) and then were either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two (HU + IR). Tibiae were analyzed by microCT for cancellous bone parameters such as bone volume fraction (BV/TV, Panel a), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, Panel b), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, Panel c), and trabecular number (Tb.N, Panel d). Data shown are mean + /− S.D. Different letters indicate p < 0.05,1-factor ANOVA with all pairs Tukey Kramer.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Coronal-slice microCT images and 3D reconstructions of cancellous bone of the tibia after exposure to simulated spaceflight. Mice were fed either CD or DP and then were either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two (HU + IR). Tibiae were imaged using microCT and 3D reconstructions were performed. (a) Representative coronal bone slices and (b) representative microCT images of cancellous bone after 3D reconstruction are illustrated for all treatment groups.To assess possible effects of a period of prefeeding mice with either CD or DP on microarchitecture, (and prior to initiating hindimb unloading), mice were prefed the diets for 17 days and the cancellous tibia analyzed by microCT. Mice fed the DP diet showed no effect of diet in BV/TV, Tb.N or Tb.Sp although a modest increase (+7%) in Tb.Th was observed (Supplementary table 2) which has been published before35,37,58. To determine changes in cortical bone morphometry, two different locations of the tibia were analyzed, and the lengths of the tibiae were measured (Table 1). Tibiae lengths were unchanged after exposure to the treatments or diets. In CD-fed mice, cortical thickness at the proximal tibia was lower in mice exposed to HU (−10%) and the combination of HU and IR (−9%) compared to NL controls (Table 1). In DP-fed diet cortical thickness was lower only with combined treatment, not after exposure to HU alone when compared to the CD,NL group. No significant changes were observed in the cortical parameters measured at the distal tibia for mice fed either diet (Table 1). Table 1.

Different letters indicate p < 0.05,1-factor ANOVA with all pairs Tukey Kramer.Axial Skeleton Feeding mice the DP diet prevented bone loss in both cancellous and cortical compartments of the L4 vertebrae which was evident in CD-fed mice (Fig. 4). For vertebrae, the cortical shell and cancellous tissue were integrated to discern changes in total (Tt) vertebral body bone parameters. Whole vertebral body analysis revealed that CD-fed mice exposed to HU or HU + IR resulted in a 10% and 11% decrease in Tt.BV/TV, respectively (Fig. 4, panel a). Trabeculae showed reduced thickness after exposure to HU and HU + IR (−11% and −10%, respectively, Fig. 4, panel b), but Tb.Sp and Tb.N were not significantly affected (data not shown). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cancellous and cortical bone loss of the vertebrae after exposure to simulated spaceflight. Mice were fed either CD or DP diets, and either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two treatments (HU + IR). Vertebrae were analyzed by microCT for changes in bone microarchitectural parameters such as total (Tt) vertebral body bone volume fraction (Tt.BV/TV, Panel a) and total vertebral body trabecular thickness (Tt.Tb.Th, Panel b) as well as for changes in cortical bone parameters including cortical thickness (Ct.Th, Panel c) and cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, panel d). Data shown are mean + /− S.D. (n = 7–10/group). Different letters indicate p < 0.05,1-factor ANOVA with all pairs Tukey Kramer.The posterior cortical shell of the vertebral body was computationally isolated from cancellous tissue to assess specific cortical parameters. Mice fed the CD diet showed decreased Ct.Th and Ct.Ar after exposure to HU (Ct.Th: −18% and Ct.Ar: −24%) and HU + IR (Ct.Th: −14% and Ct.Ar: −18%) (Fig. 4, panels c and d). In DP mice, the NL group had a 9% greater Tt.BV/TV compared to the CD, NL group, demonstrating an anabolic effect of the DP diet on cortical bone volume (Fig. 4, panel a). Mice fed the DP diet did not show any HU-induced decrements. Exposure to IR did not result in any changes to the microarchitecture of the vertebrae. No changes were observed in terms of vertebrae height (data not shown). Effects of the Dried Plum diet on vertebral strength Monotonic compression testing of L4 vertebrae was performed to determine differences in mechanical properties of the bone tissue. Mechanical properties of interest included maximum load (i.e. the greatest force endured by the material before failure), and stiffness (i.e. the force needed to displace the material a standard distance). The maximum load for mice on the CD diet was 35% and 36% lower after exposure to HU and HU + IR respectively, compared to NL controls (Fig. 5, panel a). Based on our analysis, stiffness normalized to vertebral height in the CD fed groups did not meet criteria for a significant decrease when exposed to HU or HU + IR (Fig. 5, panel b). There was however a notable trend that HU (−40%) and HU + IR (−25%) led to decreased vertebral stiffness. We did however, see that there is an 85% greater stiffness in the DP fed, HU group compared to the CD-fed, HU group indicating that when exposed to HU, DP alone improved the stiffness of the vertebrae. Representative force-displacement curves are shown in Fig. 5 for the mice fed the CD diet (panel c) versus mice fed the DP diet (panel d). Mice fed the DP diet did not show significant decrements in maximum load or stiffness relative to CD-fed, NL mice. This suggests simulated microgravity reduced the strength of the vertebrae in CD-fed mice while mice fed the DP diet were protected against such deficits. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differences in vertebrae compressive strength after exposure to simulated spaceflight. Mice were fed either the control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP), and were either irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), hindlimb unloaded (HU), or treated with both (HU + IR). Monotonic compression testing was performed on the L4 vertebrae to obtain information about differences in maximum load (a) and vertebral stiffness (b). Stiffness was normalized to vertebral height. Representative force-displacement curves are shown for compression of the L4 vertebrae when mice were fed the CD diet (c) versus the DP diet (d). Data shown are mean + /− S.D. (n = 5–10/group). Different letters indicate p < 0.05,1-factor ANOVA with all pairs Tukey Kramer. Prevention of osteoblastogenesis impairment after exposure to hindlimb unloading Bone marrow cells were flushed from the femur and cultured with an osteoblastogenic media to differentiate the cells into bone-forming osteoblasts. Colonies formed by the osteoblasts in culture were counted on day 10 to quantify osteogenic cell growth and evaluated for osteogenic differentiation after 30 days in culture. Osteoblast mineralization was quantified as a percent area. Mice fed the CD diet had a significant decrease (49%) in colony counts (Fig. 6, panel a). CD-fed mice displayed a reduction in percent area mineralized after exposure to HU compared to the NL mice (97%). In contrast, mice fed the DP diet did not sustain any decrease in their osteoblast colony formation despite exposure to HU (Fig. 6, panel a). In addition, mice fed the DP diet did not show a significant decrement in percent mineralized area after exposure to HU (Fig. 6, panel b).

    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we investigated the bone protective potential of DP against independent and combined effects of simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation on the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. A diet supplemented with DP prevented most of the simulated spaceflight-induced damages to both the appendicular (i.e. tibia) and axial (i.e. vertebrae) skeleton. When mice were fed the control diet, a relatively high dose (2 Gy) of low-LET gamma radiation exclusively decreased the BV/TV and Tb.Sp of cancellous tissue in the tibia. Based on our results, cancellous bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which overall, expanded the space between trabeculae. HU for 14 days caused bone loss within both cancellous and cortical regions of the tibia and the L4 vertebrae. HU also led to reduced compressive strength of the vertebral body. The independent effects of HU and IR remained of similar magnitude in each tissue compartment when mice were exposed to HU and IR simultaneously. Regardless of the treatment (with one exception, Ct.Th proximal tibia), consumption of the dried plum diet prevented detrimental skeletal changes. Mice fed the control diet and exposed solely to IR displayed a 20% decrement in BV/TV and a 7% increase in the Tb.Sp of the tibia’s cancellous region relative to the sham control. These parameters were unaffected by HU alone. HU groups exhibited a lesser 11% decrement in Tb.Th. When IR was combined with HU, BV/TV decreased by another 5%. These results indicate that HU and IR were not clearly additive in this experiment. Among the parameters analyzed, IR only induced changes in Tb.Th and Tb.Sp. Unlike reports by others, there were no significant changes in Tb.N from any of the treatment groups relative to the sham-irradiated control group21,43,44. When HU was combined with IR, Tb.Th decreased by 9%. Our results indicate bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which expanded the space between trabeculae. The trabeculae contribute to percent bone volume and microarchitectural integrity. Since HU affects the cortical as well as cancellous tissue, we also determined the extent of cortical bone loss. The cortical region (cortical shell) exhibited a decrease in cortical thickness when mice fed the control diet were exposed to HU, either independently or in combination with IR. When mice were fed the DP diet, IR-induced cancellous bone loss was entirely prevented, consistent with the radio-protective results reported in our previous study43. DP also protected the tibia when IR was combined with HU, which is a novel finding in this report. The decrease in trabecular thickness incurred by HU and HU + IR was entirely prevented by consumption of the DP diet. The DP diet also protected from HU-induced decrease in cortical thickness. Unlike the proximal tibia, the distal tibia did not show changes in cortical structure. In contrast, in the proximal tibia HU and IR together, not each treatment alone, caused a decrease in cortical thickness of the proximal tibia. This finding suggests that DP diet cannot fully prevent from all aspects of bone structural deficits induced by simulated spaceflight. In order to confirm our results, we examined another skeletal site, the vertebra, which is a representative axial bone. Under conditions of simulated weightlessness and consumption of control diet, BV/TV and Tt.Tb.Th of the vertebral body were reduced accompanied by a reduction in cortical thickness and cortical bone area. Collectively, these findings indicate an overall deterioration of bone via thinning of the vertebrae’s trabeculae and cortical tissue. This deterioration of the microarchitecture directly impacted the overall strength of the tissue57,59,60, as reflected in the decrease in maximum load tolerable by the vertebral body, as well as the decrease in material stiffness as measured by mechanical compression testing. Taken together, these changes in both microarchitecture and strength have the potential to lead to fracture. However, these changes were not observed when mice were exposed to IR alone. In contrast to other studies where high-LET 56Fe radiation was utilized in combination with HU, our results did not indicate an additive effect of IR on the deterioration of strength and structure of the L4 vertebrae57. HU-induced damage to the vertebral body was entirely prevented when mice consumed the DP diet. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant increase in Tt.BV/TV (9%, Fig. 4, panel a) for sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the DP compared to the sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the CD. This elevated Tt.BV/TV was consistent for all treatment groups fed DP when compared to NL, CD-fed mice, suggesting a potential anabolic effect of DP. Treatments that are currently in use to mitigate the effects of mechanical unloading are not without limitations and risks. Exercise in combination with drug treatments such as bisphosphonates have shown beneficial effects in astronauts61,62. However, in patients with osteoporosis, the use of bisphosphonates can increase the risk for atypical femoral fractures possibly due to suppressed bone turnover which may lead to cracks at the microscale and loss of mechanical strength63,64. Although rare, other notable side effects that have been reported to accompany bisphosphonate therapy including osteonecrosis of the jaw65 and atrial fibrillation66. Another limitation of bisphosphonates is that they act mostly on osteoclasts61. Osteoblastogenesis from flushed bone marrow cells of the femur was strongly inhibited by exposure to HU, indicating that HU directly damages osteoblast progenitors, potentially affecting in situ bone formation (Fig. 6). Mineralization of the osteoblast cells from DP-fed mice was partially restored and taken together with the cell growth data, indicates that DP could prevent the loss of structure and strength by protecting the marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Ex vivo osteoblastogenesis was only performed on mice exposed to HU because it has been shown previously that low-LET in vivo gamma radiation does not negatively impact osteoblasts57,67. These data points toward dried plum playing an active role in protecting osteoprogenitors, possibly by maintaining the osteoblast’s growth and differentiation. Recently, Graef et al.42 showed that treatment of bone marrow-derived osteoblast cells with particular fractions of DP polyphenols led to an increase in gene expression of Runx2 one hour after treatment as well as an increase in mineralized nodules42. When evaluated in combination with our findings, this supports the potential mechanism that dried plum activates osteoblasts, which may lead to an increase in bone formation. It should be noted, however, that another paper published by the same group showed that fractions of dried plum polyphenols were not as effective at preventing bone loss in a rodent model of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in comparison to a diet supplemented with whole dried plum41. Thus, follow-up studies are needed to compare the potential protective effect of these polyphenol fractions on bone exposed to simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation. In addition, establishing the efficacy of formulations of DP (dried whole fruit vs defined components) may facilitate the further development of DP as a countermeasure for spaceflight. One limitation in our study is the lack of data on osteoclasts, and therefore we cannot determine if bone resorbing osteoclasts also contribute to the observed protective effects of the DP diet. Since HU and radiation can each increase osteoclasts, and a stimulation of bone resorption may contribute to the observed bone loss, DP may exert protective effects by inhibiting resorption, increasing formation, or both. Overall, the ability of DP to protect osteoblast progenitor cells from HU-induced damage, as shown in this study, holds much promise for development of next generation anti-osteoporotic drugs due to the possibility that DP to act on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Our current study is limited to short-duration HU (2 weeks); since astronauts on long-term space missions may require a countermeasure for bone loss throughout the entirety of a multi-year mission beyond LEO, it is important in future studies to determine if DP is protective for long-term exposure to simulated, or actual, spaceflight. Further studies also are needed to gain more insight into any potential long-term side effects of consuming a dried plum diet. Dried plum’s potential as a countermeasure against both radiation- and microgravity-induced osteopenia such as loss of bone strength and structure in the tibia and vertebrae has important implications for astronauts in space as well as radiation workers, radiotherapy patients, and individuals with osteoporosis.",

Copyright notice ID: 7162976 PMID: 32300161 Abstract Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight. Subject terms: Pharmaceutics, BoneIntroduction Alterations in the gravity vector and exposure to ionizing radiation can disrupt skeletal homeostasis in mice1–3. There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss4–6. Decrements in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in astronauts from the Mir missions as well as missions to the International Space Station (ISS)7–9. While much research has focused on the detrimental effects of microgravity on skeletal tissue, less is known about the impact of spaceflight radiation. Crewed missions have, to this point, primarily remained within low-Earth orbit (LEO). While sources of ionizing space radiation within LEO include galactic cosmic radiation and charged particles from unpredictable solar particle events (SPE)10,11, the presence of the Earth’s magnetosphere reduces exposure to ionizing space radiation. Missions beyond LEO pose the greatest risk of radiation exposure and is of significant concern for crew health12–14. Spaceflight-relevant radiation includes a mix of low-linear energy transfer (LET) species such as protons and helium ions as well as high-LET species such as iron15,16. Beyond LEO, for example, astronauts may be exposed to up to 0.7 Sv of ionizing radiation12,15,17 during a multi-year mission to the Moon or Mars14,15,18. On Earth, bone homeostasis is effectively maintained by the controlled remodeling activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, exposure to low-LET radiation (137Cs or X-ray, 1–2 Gy) leads to a transient increase in the number of osteoclasts, accompanied by an increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and decrease in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), overall leading to a reduction in bone volume fraction (BV/TV)19–22. Together, this early increase in bone resorption and decrease in bone formation due to radiation exposure can result in a state of osteopenia, potentially leading to an increased risk of bone fracture16,23,24. A possible mechanism of action responsible for these changes in bone homeostasis is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to radiation exposure2,25. Furthermore, reduction of antioxidant defense mechanisms26,27 and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines16,28 have been associated with altered redox-balance due to radiation exposure. Together, these critical changes in cellular signaling lead to compromised bone strength and increased fracture risk25,29. Due to the involvement of redox-signaling in radiation-induced bone loss, antioxidants have been considered as candidate countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced bone loss30. Proposed mechanisms by which antioxidants exert protective effects include the quenching of ROS via an increase in antioxidant activity and decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling cascades29. Dried plum, Prunus domestica L., has been shown to have beneficial effects against bone loss31 (reviewed in Wallace et al. 2017). Dried plum’s positive effects on bone health markers have been investigated in multiple models of osteopenia, in both human clinical trials32–36 and rodent studies37,38. While the mechanism of action of dried plum is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that the high antioxidant capacity and high polyphenolic content of this fruit scavenges free-radicals as well as promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption39–42. Our lab has reported that mice fed a diet composed of Dried Plum (DP) prevented cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation (IR), both low-LET such as gamma (137Cs) and a mixture of both low-LET and high-LET (sequential beam of proton, 1H and iron, 56Fe). The proposed mechanism for DP’s protective effect is via the prevention of radiation-induced increases in markers of bone resorption, inflammation and oxidative stress43. Since the spaceflight environment includes exposure to both IR and microgravity, we sought to extend our hypothesis that DP could be a countermeasure for both radiation- and microgravity-induced bone loss. The current literature indicates that simulated microgravity and IR each have detrimental effects on cancellous bone structure, although there is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and IR cause additive or synergistic effects when combined20,44,45. Thus, more studies are needed to determine whether combining simulated microgravity and IR leads to cumulative effects compared to simulated microgravity and IR alone. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents46. This model allows for a simulation of the cephalad fluid shift47 and removal of load-bearing forces typically experienced by the hindlimbs, which can lead to increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and decreased numbers of bone-forming osteoblasts48. Together, these events result in bone loss as well as reduced bone mechanical properties in rodents49–52. In addition, exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors53,54. The bone marrow niche contains osteoblast progenitors cells4 and it has been shown that exposure to microgravity alters the cells proliferation capacity and impairs their ability to produce extracellular matrix, in turn inhibiting the maturation of the bone matrix. Thus, the ability to maintain bone homeostasis is diminished16,54–56. To address these knowledge gaps related to spaceflight-induced bone loss and candidate countermeasures, we sought to evaluate the potentially distinct effects of microgravity and ionizing radiation when applied independently, or in combination. For this study, we utilized the HU model and exposure to total body irradiation (137Cs gamma radiation, at 2 Gy dose) as analogs of weightlessness and radiation exposure, respectively. A relatively high dose of radiation (2 Gy) was chosen as a positive control dose to ensure bone loss in rodents and to allow for testing of DP as a countermeasure, as previously described43. We sought to determine whether DP diet prevents simulated microgravity-induced bone loss alone, and in combination with radiation, as compared to respective control diet controls. We also assessed the ability of DP to mitigate simulated weightlessness- and/or radiation-induced changes to the axial skeleton57, specifically the lumbar 4 (L4) vertebrae. We analyzed both cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. Additionally, we determined whether the DP diet had the capacity to protect osteoprogenitors after exposure to simulated microgravity, an essential part in the healthy maintenance of skeletal tissue.Results Body weight Skeletally mature, male mice, 14 weeks of age, were assigned to groups (n = 10/group) and pre-fed for 14 days with either a control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP) (Fig. 1). Mice were assigned to the following groups at the start of the experiment: normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU) for a total of 14 days at 16 weeks of age, with either sham radiation or IR exposure on day 3. The experiment was completed on day 14 and samples of interest were collected (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental treatment groups and experiment design. (a) Male mice were assigned to groups (n = 10/group) and pre-fed with either a control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP). Mice were assigned to the following groups: 14 days of normally loaded conditions (NL) (Groups 1,2), hindlimb unloading (HU) alone (Groups 3,4), or HU in combination with ionizing radiation (IR), at a dose of 2 Gy 137Cs (0.8 Gy/min) (Groups 5, 6, 7, 8). (b) Mice were pre-fed with either CD or DP diets 14 days before onset of HU treatment, mice were exposed to IR 3 days after onset of HU, and samples were collected 14 days after initiation of HU treatment. At time of tissue collection (day 14), bone marrow cells were flushed from the femora’s of groups 1, 2, 3, 4 (n = 5/group) and cultured for 30 days for osteoblastogenesis (OB).Body weights were recorded during the experiment to assess the overall health of the mice. As expected, HU mice showed decrements body weights starting from day 3 until day 9, at which point the body weights stabilize (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, exposure to IR did not result in significant changes in body weights.Prevention of bone loss after exposure to simulated spaceflight Micro-computed tomography (microCT) was utilized to quantify differences in bone microarchitecture after HU, IR or the combination of both treatments. We performed this analysis on both the cancellous and cortical regions of the appendicular (i.e. tibia) and axial (i.e. vertebra) skeleton. Appendicular Skeleton Mice exposed to simulated spaceflight factors, alone or combined, and fed a DP diet did not exhibit significant deficits in cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia compared to NL control mice, whereas mice fed the CD diet showed structural deficits in cancellous microarchitecture. In CD-fed mice, exposure to IR alone led to a 20% decrease in percent bone volume (BV/TV) and a modest but statistically significant 7% increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (Fig. 2, panels a and c), but did not decrease trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), nor trabecular numbers (Tb.N) compared to NL controls (Fig. 2, panels b and d). Similarly, exposure of CD-fed mice to HU alone resulted in an 11% decrease in Tb.Th (Fig. 2, panel b), but did not significantly affect the other parameters. In CD-fed mice, the combined treatment (HU and IR) led to a 25% decrease in BV/TV, accompanied by a modest but statistically significant 9% decrease in Tb.Th as well as an 8% increase in Tb.Sp when compared to NL controls (Fig. 2). Overall, mice fed the CD diet and exposed to simulated spaceflight led to a thinning of the trabeculae and greater separation between trabeculae, leading to a significant decrease in the BV/TV within the cancellous compartment. In DP-fed mice, the combination of HU and IR led to a statistically significant decline in Tb.Th relative to HU or IR alone. Together, these results indicate both a radioprotective effect of the DP diet on BV/TV and Tb.Sp, as well as a partial protection against HU-induced trabecular thinning. Of the cancellous parameters analyzed in the tibia, there were no significant differences due to diet alone between NL mice. Representative images are shown from each group in Fig. 3, with coronal view of the tibiae (panel a) and 3D reconstruction of the cancellous volume of interest (panel b), in which the skeletal decrements due to simulated spaceflight were observed in mice fed CD diet, but not in mice fed the DP diet. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effect of DP diet on cancellous bone loss induced by simulated spaceflight. Mice were separated into groups (n = 10/group), fed specific diets (either Control Diet, CD or Dried Plum diet, DP) and then were either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two (HU + IR). Tibiae were analyzed by microCT for cancellous bone parameters such as bone volume fraction (BV/TV, Panel a), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, Panel b), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, Panel c), and trabecular number (Tb.N, Panel d).

Mice were fed either CD or DP and then were either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two (HU + IR). Tibiae were imaged using microCT and 3D reconstructions were performed. (a) Representative coronal bone slices and (b) representative microCT images of cancellous bone after 3D reconstruction are illustrated for all treatment groups.To assess possible effects of a period of prefeeding mice with either CD or DP on microarchitecture, (and prior to initiating hindimb unloading), mice were prefed the diets for 17 days and the cancellous tibia analyzed by microCT. Mice fed the DP diet showed no effect of diet in BV/TV, Tb.N or Tb.Sp although a modest increase (+7%) in Tb.Th was observed (Supplementary table 2) which has been published before35,37,58. To determine changes in cortical bone morphometry, two different locations of the tibia were analyzed, and the lengths of the tibiae were measured (Table 1). Tibiae lengths were unchanged after exposure to the treatments or diets. In CD-fed mice, cortical thickness at the proximal tibia was lower in mice exposed to HU (−10%) and the combination of HU and IR (−9%) compared to NL controls (Table 1). In DP-fed diet cortical thickness was lower only with combined treatment, not after exposure to HU alone when compared to the CD,NL group. No significant changes were observed in the cortical parameters measured at the distal tibia for mice fed either diet (Table 1). Table 1.

For vertebrae, the cortical shell and cancellous tissue were integrated to discern changes in total (Tt) vertebral body bone parameters. Whole vertebral body analysis revealed that CD-fed mice exposed to HU or HU + IR resulted in a 10% and 11% decrease in Tt.BV/TV, respectively (Fig. 4, panel a). Trabeculae showed reduced thickness after exposure to HU and HU + IR (−11% and −10%, respectively, Fig. 4, panel b), but Tb.Sp and Tb.N were not significantly affected (data not shown). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cancellous and cortical bone loss of the vertebrae after exposure to simulated spaceflight. Mice were fed either CD or DP diets, and either unloaded to simulate weightlessness (HU), irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), or a combination of the two treatments (HU + IR). Vertebrae were analyzed by microCT for changes in bone microarchitectural parameters such as total (Tt) vertebral body bone volume fraction (Tt.BV/TV, Panel a) and total vertebral body trabecular thickness (Tt.Tb.Th, Panel b) as well as for changes in cortical bone parameters including cortical thickness (Ct.Th, Panel c) and cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, panel d). Data shown are mean + /− S.D. (n = 7–10/group). Different letters indicate p < 0.05,1-factor ANOVA with all pairs Tukey Kramer.The posterior cortical shell of the vertebral body was computationally isolated from cancellous tissue to assess specific cortical parameters. Mice fed the CD diet showed decreased Ct.Th and Ct.Ar after exposure to HU (Ct.Th: −18% and Ct.Ar: −24%) and HU + IR (Ct.Th: −14% and Ct.Ar: −18%) (Fig. 4, panels c and d). In DP mice, the NL group had a 9% greater Tt.BV/TV compared to the CD, NL group, demonstrating an anabolic effect of the DP diet on cortical bone volume (Fig. 4, panel a). Mice fed the DP diet did not show any HU-induced decrements. Exposure to IR did not result in any changes to the microarchitecture of the vertebrae. No changes were observed in terms of vertebrae height (data not shown).Effects of the Dried Plum diet on vertebral strength Monotonic compression testing of L4 vertebrae was performed to determine differences in mechanical properties of the bone tissue. Mechanical properties of interest included maximum load (i.e. the greatest force endured by the material before failure), and stiffness (i.e. the force needed to displace the material a standard distance). The maximum load for mice on the CD diet was 35% and 36% lower after exposure to HU and HU + IR respectively, compared to NL controls (Fig. 5, panel a). Based on our analysis, stiffness normalized to vertebral height in the CD fed groups did not meet criteria for a significant decrease when exposed to HU or HU + IR (Fig. 5, panel b). There was however a notable trend that HU (−40%) and HU + IR (−25%) led to decreased vertebral stiffness. We did however, see that there is an 85% greater stiffness in the DP fed, HU group compared to the CD-fed, HU group indicating that when exposed to HU, DP alone improved the stiffness of the vertebrae. Representative force-displacement curves are shown in Fig. 5 for the mice fed the CD diet (panel c) versus mice fed the DP diet (panel d). Mice fed the DP diet did not show significant decrements in maximum load or stiffness relative to CD-fed, NL mice. This suggests simulated microgravity reduced the strength of the vertebrae in CD-fed mice while mice fed the DP diet were protected against such deficits. Figure 5.

Mice were fed either the control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP), and were either irradiated with 2 Gy 137Cs (IR), hindlimb unloaded (HU), or treated with both (HU + IR). Monotonic compression testing was performed on the L4 vertebrae to obtain information about differences in maximum load (a) and vertebral stiffness (b). Stiffness was normalized to vertebral height. Representative force-displacement curves are shown for compression of the L4 vertebrae when mice were fed the CD diet (c) versus the DP diet (d). Data shown are mean + /− S.D. (n = 5–10/group).

Colonies formed by the osteoblasts in culture were counted on day 10 to quantify osteogenic cell growth and evaluated for osteogenic differentiation after 30 days in culture. Osteoblast mineralization was quantified as a percent area. Mice fed the CD diet had a significant decrease (49%) in colony counts (Fig. 6, panel a). CD-fed mice displayed a reduction in percent area mineralized after exposure to HU compared to the NL mice (97%). In contrast, mice fed the DP diet did not sustain any decrease in their osteoblast colony formation despite exposure to HU (Fig. 6, panel a). In addition, mice fed the DP diet did not show a significant decrement in percent mineralized area after exposure to HU (Fig. 6, panel b). Representative images of the mineralization are shown in Fig. 6, panel c. Taken together, the DP diet show a protective effect against HU-induced decrease in osteoblast cell proliferation and differentiation. Figure 6.

A diet supplemented with DP prevented most of the simulated spaceflight-induced damages to both the appendicular (i.e. tibia) and axial (i.e. vertebrae) skeleton. When mice were fed the control diet, a relatively high dose (2 Gy) of low-LET gamma radiation exclusively decreased the BV/TV and Tb.Sp of cancellous tissue in the tibia. Based on our results, cancellous bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which overall, expanded the space between trabeculae. HU for 14 days caused bone loss within both cancellous and cortical regions of the tibia and the L4 vertebrae. HU also led to reduced compressive strength of the vertebral body. The independent effects of HU and IR remained of similar magnitude in each tissue compartment when mice were exposed to HU and IR simultaneously. Regardless of the treatment (with one exception, Ct.Th proximal tibia), consumption of the dried plum diet prevented detrimental skeletal changes. Mice fed the control diet and exposed solely to IR displayed a 20% decrement in BV/TV and a 7% increase in the Tb.Sp of the tibia’s cancellous region relative to the sham control. These parameters were unaffected by HU alone. HU groups exhibited a lesser 11% decrement in Tb.Th. When IR was combined with HU, BV/TV decreased by another 5%. These results indicate that HU and IR were not clearly additive in this experiment. Among the parameters analyzed, IR only induced changes in Tb.Th and Tb.Sp. Unlike reports by others, there were no significant changes in Tb.N from any of the treatment groups relative to the sham-irradiated control group21,43,44. When HU was combined with IR, Tb.Th decreased by 9%. Our results indicate bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which expanded the space between trabeculae. The trabeculae contribute to percent bone volume and microarchitectural integrity. Since HU affects the cortical as well as cancellous tissue, we also determined the extent of cortical bone loss. The cortical region (cortical shell) exhibited a decrease in cortical thickness when mice fed the control diet were exposed to HU, either independently or in combination with IR. When mice were fed the DP diet, IR-induced cancellous bone loss was entirely prevented, consistent with the radio-protective results reported in our previous study43. DP also protected the tibia when IR was combined with HU, which is a novel finding in this report. The decrease in trabecular thickness incurred by HU and HU + IR was entirely prevented by consumption of the DP diet. The DP diet also protected from HU-induced decrease in cortical thickness. Unlike the proximal tibia, the distal tibia did not show changes in cortical structure. In contrast, in the proximal tibia HU and IR together, not each treatment alone, caused a decrease in cortical thickness of the proximal tibia. This finding suggests that DP diet cannot fully prevent from all aspects of bone structural deficits induced by simulated spaceflight. In order to confirm our results, we examined another skeletal site, the vertebra, which is a representative axial bone. Under conditions of simulated weightlessness and consumption of control diet, BV/TV and Tt.Tb.Th of the vertebral body were reduced accompanied by a reduction in cortical thickness and cortical bone area. Collectively, these findings indicate an overall deterioration of bone via thinning of the vertebrae’s trabeculae and cortical tissue. This deterioration of the microarchitecture directly impacted the overall strength of the tissue57,59,60, as reflected in the decrease in maximum load tolerable by the vertebral body, as well as the decrease in material stiffness as measured by mechanical compression testing. Taken together, these changes in both microarchitecture and strength have the potential to lead to fracture. However, these changes were not observed when mice were exposed to IR alone. In contrast to other studies where high-LET 56Fe radiation was utilized in combination with HU, our results did not indicate an additive effect of IR on the deterioration of strength and structure of the L4 vertebrae57. HU-induced damage to the vertebral body was entirely prevented when mice consumed the DP diet. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant increase in Tt.BV/TV (9%, Fig. 4, panel a) for sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the DP compared to the sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the CD. This elevated Tt.BV/TV was consistent for all treatment groups fed DP when compared to NL, CD-fed mice, suggesting a potential anabolic effect of DP. Treatments that are currently in use to mitigate the effects of mechanical unloading are not without limitations and risks. Exercise in combination with drug treatments such as bisphosphonates have shown beneficial effects in astronauts61,62. However, in patients with osteoporosis, the use of bisphosphonates can increase the risk for atypical femoral fractures possibly due to suppressed bone turnover which may lead to cracks at the microscale and loss of mechanical strength63,64. Although rare, other notable side effects that have been reported to accompany bisphosphonate therapy including osteonecrosis of the jaw65 and atrial fibrillation66. Another limitation of bisphosphonates is that they act mostly on osteoclasts61. Osteoblastogenesis from flushed bone marrow cells of the femur was strongly inhibited by exposure to HU, indicating that HU directly damages osteoblast progenitors, potentially affecting in situ bone formation (Fig. 6). Mineralization of the osteoblast cells from DP-fed mice was partially restored and taken together with the cell growth data, indicates that DP could prevent the loss of structure and strength by protecting the marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Ex vivo osteoblastogenesis was only performed on mice exposed to HU because it has been shown previously that low-LET in vivo gamma radiation does not negatively impact osteoblasts57,67. These data points toward dried plum playing an active role in protecting osteoprogenitors, possibly by maintaining the osteoblast’s growth and differentiation. Recently, Graef et al.42 showed that treatment of bone marrow-derived osteoblast cells with particular fractions of DP polyphenols led to an increase in gene expression of Runx2 one hour after treatment as well as an increase in mineralized nodules42. When evaluated in combination with our findings, this supports the potential mechanism that dried plum activates osteoblasts, which may lead to an increase in bone formation. It should be noted, however, that another paper published by the same group showed that fractions of dried plum polyphenols were not as effective at preventing bone loss in a rodent model of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in comparison to a diet supplemented with whole dried plum41. Thus, follow-up studies are needed to compare the potential protective effect of these polyphenol fractions on bone exposed to simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation. In addition, establishing the efficacy of formulations of DP (dried whole fruit vs defined components) may facilitate the further development of DP as a countermeasure for spaceflight. One limitation in our study is the lack of data on osteoclasts, and therefore we cannot determine if bone resorbing osteoclasts also contribute to the observed protective effects of the DP diet. Since HU and radiation can each increase osteoclasts, and a stimulation of bone resorption may contribute to the observed bone loss, DP may exert protective effects by inhibiting resorption, increasing formation, or both. Overall, the ability of DP to protect osteoblast progenitor cells from HU-induced damage, as shown in this study, holds much promise for development of next generation anti-osteoporotic drugs due to the possibility that DP to act on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Our current study is limited to short-duration HU (2 weeks); since astronauts on long-term space missions may require a countermeasure for bone loss throughout the entirety of a multi-year mission beyond LEO, it is important in future studies to determine if DP is protective for long-term exposure to simulated, or actual, spaceflight. Further studies also are needed to gain more insight into any potential long-term side effects of consuming a dried plum diet. Dried plum’s potential as a countermeasure against both radiation- and microgravity-induced osteopenia such as loss of bone strength and structure in the tibia and vertebrae has important implications for astronauts in space as well as radiation workers, radiotherapy patients, and individuals with osteoporosis.Methods Animals and treatments Male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) at 14 weeks of age were weight matched, assigned to groups (n = 10/group), and individually housed in standard vivarium cages or custom-designed HU cages as previously described46. Our justification for using mice of this age is that they are considered skeletally mature at the time of initiating treatment (HU and/or IR) so that the effects of HU and/or IR on the 16 week old mice can be attributed to dietary effects on the adult, rather than rather than on the growing skeleton. We have extensive previous reports showing this age and duration of HU and IR treatment yields the predicted bone loss (45,57,68–70). 14 week old mice were used to allow for a 2 week pre-feeding period. Two weeks of prefeeding period was selected to provide sufficient time for animals to adapt to the diet prior to initiating exposure to simulated spaceflight, while avoiding a lengthy pre-feeding period, which may potentially affect bone structural and/or mechanical properties prior to initiating treatments. Animals assigned to the HU group were suspended with traction tape based on previously established procedures46,71. The room conditions was maintained at an average 73.3°F, 31% humidity, 12 hours light/dark cycle), with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal weights (Supplementary table 1) were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment to asses health of the mice. The NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.Diets Two diets were used for this study: The control diet (CD) was a defined formulation (AIN93M, Teklad, Madison, WI) while the DP diet was composed of the AIN93M diet supplemented with 25% by weight dried plum powder (from the California Dried Plum Board) and was compounded by Teklad as described previously35,37,38,43,58,72,73.Experimental protocol Animals were pre-fed with either CD or DP diet for a period of 14 days in standard vivarium cages prior to undergoing sham-unloading or HU. Animals undergoing HU were allowed to acclimate to their new cage environment three days prior to initiating HU. Initiation of HU was considered to be day 0 of the experiment (Fig. 1, panel b). Sham-unloaded animals were handled similarly to HU mice, without undergoing actual tail suspension, followed by housing in NL conditions in vivarium cages. On day 3, animals were either exposed to sham-irradiation or total body IR. Mice were fed their respective diets until time of euthanasia (day 14). At time of euthanasia, tibiae, femora, and vertebrae were collected and processed for micro-computed tomography (microCT) or ex vivo cell culture.Radiation exposure At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to 2 Gy Gamma of whole-body IR (137Cs at 0.83 Gy/min, JL Shepherd Mark I, San Gabriel, CA) as used in Schreurs et al.43. For this treatment, mice were housed individually in a custom animal holding cage, maintaining HU mice in a head-down position. Mice were placed in the irradiator chamber and exposed to TBI. The unloading of mice was maintained during irradiation by custom small HU cages. Sham-irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off.MicroCT At the time of sample collection, tibiae were cut distal to the tibio-fibular junction (TFJ) to allow complete infiltration of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, Sigma). After 24 hours at 4 °C, samples were transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage. The day before imaging, bones were rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco 1×, pH 7.4). MicroCT was then conducted using SkyScan 1272 (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with a 0.25 mm aluminum filter, x-ray tube potential of 60 kV and x-ray intensity of 166 μA. For the analysis of cancellous bone, scans were performed with a resolution of 3.5 μm/voxel resolution (integration time = 840 ms, frame averaging = 3, rotation step = 0.600°). A 1.0mm-thick region of cancellous bone located 0.5 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and auto-contoured as detailed by Buie et al.74, with minor modifications (SkyScan, CT Analyzer). From this auto-contouring program, bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm) were calculated to assess bone microarchitecture and reported following conventional guidelines75. An automated contouring program was used to select and measure the microarchitecture of the cortical shell surrounding the abovementioned cancellous region. From this auto-contouring program, cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm) and cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, mm2) were calculated. To assess microarchitecture of the cortical compartment of the distal tibia, bones were scanned with a resolution of 12μm/voxel (integration time = 420 ms, frame averaging = 3, rotation step = 0.400°), and a 0.3 mm thick region located 2 mm proximal to the TFJ was selected and auto-contoured. Cortical parameters of interest included periosteal (Peri.P,mm) and endosteal (Endo.P, mm) perimeters, cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), mean polar moment of inertia (J, mm4), cortical bone volume (BV, mm3), marrow volume (mm3), marrow area (mm2), and volumetric tissue mineral density (TMD, g/cm3). Calcium hydroxyapatite phantoms (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) were utilized to validate TMD by converting linear-attenuation coefficient of the material to TMD of the phantom75. MicroCT analysis was also performed on the fourth lumbar (L4) vertebrae. Before scanning, vertebrae were processed to remove all transverse processes that project posteriorly in preparation for mechanical testing, as detailed below76. If a vertebral body was at all compromised during sample preparation, sample was removed from further analysis. Vertebrae were then scanned at 6μm/voxel resolution (integration time = 840 ms, frame averaging = 2, rotation step = 0.600°). Height of the vertebrae, in millimeters, was determined using the reconstructed scans. Analysis was performed on the entire, post-processed vertebral body77. An auto-contouring program was utilized to determine total (Tt)78 vertebral body bone volume fraction (Tt.BV/TV, %), total vertebral body trabecular thickness (Tt.Tb.Th, mm), total vertebral body trabecular number (Tt.Tb.N, 1/mm), and total vertebral body trabecular separation (Tt.Tb.Sp, mm). Total vertebral body is a measure of the microarchitecture of both the cortical and cancellous bone compartments. The geometry of the cortical shell was assessed separately at the posterior side of the vertebral body, as this region displays concentrated stress during uniaxial compression57.Mechanical testing – monotonic compression The vertebral column was processed to isolate the L4 vertebra and further prepared for mechanical testing as described previously76. In brief, all soft tissue was carefully removed, and endplates and posterior elements were removed using a diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany) to isolate the vertebral body and ensure plano-parallel testing surfaces. Uniaxial compressive monotonic testing was performed as described previously76. In brief, after microCT was performed as detailed above, uniaxial compressive testing was performed at ambient temperature at a platen displacement rate of 0.01 mm/sec. Force (N) and displacement (mm) data were collected during testing (1,000 Hz; WinTest 7, version 7.01). Mechanical testing was not performed on samples in which the vertebral body was compromised during sample preparation. Thus, the sample size per group was as follows: n = 10 (CD, NL), n = 5 (CD, IR), n = 8 (CD, HU), n = 7 (CD, HU + IR), n = 8 (DP, NL), n = 6 (DP, IR), n = 9 (DP, HU), and n = 6 (DP, HU + IR). Custom MATLAB code (Version R2017a, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to analyze the data and obtain maximum load at failure (N) and stiffness (N/mm). Stiffness is defined as the force required to displace a specimen a set distance, or the slope of the specimen’s force-displacement curve. Thus, stiffness was calculated as the slope of a line that best fit the middle 80% of data points in the range between the force at displacement = 0 and maximum load (i.e. a consistently linear region of the curve for all specimens). Reported stiffness (N/strain) was normalized by the height of the vertebra, as determined by microCT (Fig. 5, panel b). Due to the variation in cross-sectional area of the vertebral body from cranial to caudal ends, the elastic modulus and ultimate stress were not calculated. Ex vivo osteoblastogenic cell culture Bone marrow cells were flushed and collected from the femur at time of euthanasia (n = 5 each for NL and HU groups). The limited number of samples per group were the result of the experimental design. Bone marrow cells were then plated at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in osteogenic media (α-MEM, FBS, Ascorbic Acid and beta-glycerophosphate), as described previously2. Media was changed every 2–3 days. On day 10 in culture, colonies consisting of at least 30 cells were scored. Colony counts were normalized to area of culture plate (3.8 cm2). Cells were grown for a total of 30 days to allow for mineralization, which was then stained using the Von Kossa method2 and quantified using ImageJ (Version 1.52a, , USA).Statistical analysis Data were presented as mean and standard deviations (S.D.). If the variances between groups were equal and parametric, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed. When a main effect by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was evident, an all pairs Tukey Kramers post-hoc analysis was performed (software JMP Version 13.0). We selected this formalism to allow for multiple and direct comparisons within each diet (CD or DP) and also across the diets (i.e CD HU + IR vs DP HU + IR) to assess our specific research objective, namely determining the efficacy of dried plum as a countermeasure of bone loss against the age-matched negative control. If the data were non-parametric, Steel or Wilcoxon post-hoc analysis was performed as needed.Supplementary information Supplementary Table 1 and 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2 levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+ signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19]. Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female and male Long–Evans rats (Taconic) were selected for this study. Animals were group-housed in standard vivarium cages until the onset of HU. A group of females and males (referred to as “young”) underwent HU at three months of age, while a group of retired male breeders (referred to as “older males”) began HU at nine months of age. Normally loaded (NL) controls were individually housed in standard vivarium cages. Animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously [11]. NL controls were handled the same way as the HU animals except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. HU was conducted for either 14 days or 90 days. A subset of nine-month-old (older) males that underwent HU for 90 days were then released from the suspension apparatus to reambulate normally (Reloading, Rel) for 90 days. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. Enrichment consisted of Diamond Twists paper sticks (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and I-Chews (Newco, Hayward, CA, USA) and replenished as needed. Room temperature was maintained within a range of 20–26 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. After the designated duration of HU, animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose followed by exsanguination and decapitation. Tissues were collected shortly thereafter. Hearts were bisected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Refer to Table S1 for the sample sizes of the experiment groups included in this study. Young male and female, 90 day HU, and recovery groups were not included in the study either due to insufficient sample sizes or unavailability of appropriately processed samples. 2.2. Processing of Frozen Heart Samples Frozen hearts were retrieved from −80 °C storage and placed on a metal platform that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Left ventricular tissue was excised from the anterior to posterior ends (apex) of the heart. The excised left ventricular tissue was further cut into thirds (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior and posterior thirds were processed for DNA and RNA extraction, respectively. Samples were excluded from analyses if anatomical landmarks could not be conclusively identified for isolation of left ventricular tissue. 2.3. RNA Extraction from Cardiac Tissue Total RNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and purity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples showing an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 were used for RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). 2.4. cDNA Synthesis and qPCR First-strand DNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows. A total of 450 ng of RNA was used for a 30 uL first strand synthesis. Briefly, 1.5 uL of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# N8080127), 1.5 μL dNTPs (Qiagen, Cat# 1005631), and 12 μL of water were mixed, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. A solution-containing 3 μL RNase-free water, 6 μL 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Cat# Y02321), 3 μL DTT (Invitrogen, Cat# Y00147), and 1.5 μL RNase Out (Invitrogen, Cat# 100000840) was added to the abovementioned mix and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Then 1.5 μL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 28025013) was added to the resulting solution and incubated as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. All incubation steps were performed using a TC-312 thermocycler (Techne, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). First-strand DNA was stored at −80 °C until use for qPCR using the Taqman system. Multiplex PCR reactions were set up to measure both genes of interest and housekeeping gene expression in the same well of a 384-well plate. A premade gene expression master mix (Taqman, LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 4369016) was utilized, and each reaction was completed in duplicate. FAM-labeled Taqman probes (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the following genes of interest: nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2, Rn00582415_m1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, Rn00566938_m1), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2, Rn00690588_g1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, Rn01428096_m1). VIC-labeled ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19, Rn00821265_g1) was used as housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression levels for HU groups relative to age- and sex-matched controls were determined by the ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change. 2.5. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) Assay Total DNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of 8-OHdG was performed using OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# STA-320) following manufacturer’s specifications. Enzyme reaction/absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Softmax Pro 5 software. 2.6. RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Poly(A)+-enriched cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) instrument to generate 75 bp single-end reads. Sequencing data quality was checked using FastQC (version 0.11.5) software. Subsequently, reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using STAR (version 2.6.0c). Then, a matrix of read counts per gene was generated using “featureCounts” from the Rsubread package (version 1.30.5). Genes with low expression values were filtered from downstream analysis by requiring more than 5 reads in at least 6 samples for each gene. Subsequently, between-sample normalization was performed using EDASeq (version 2.16.0). One sample from each group had to be excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Hence, 6 samples per group were used for the succeeding analysis. RUVseq (version 1.16.0) [RUVs with k = 4] was used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. Genes differentially expressed between HU and control samples were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2), controlling for factors of unwanted variation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and heat maps generated using Morpheus, with Pearson method selected [20]. RStudio analysis software (Version 1.1.419), together with ggplot2 (version 3.1.1), ggrepel (version 0.8.0), and Bioconductor (DESeq2 version 1.22.2) packages, were used to obtain principal component analysis plots. For gene enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes meeting a log2 fold change cut-off of >0.3 or <−0.3 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were input into Toppfun [21,22]. Toppfun was used to assess functional enrichment of DEGs based on ontologies, gene family, phenotype (human disease), and pharmacome (drug–gene associations). Of the 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 121 matched the contents of the Toppfun database and were therefore included in the list for gene enrichment analysis. The DEGs that had no match in the Toppfun database were Clec4a1, Lilrb3l, Fcna, and Mill1. Gene enrichment analysis was performed at a false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg) of <0.05 and a gene limit of 2 or greater. GO Terms were plotted for visualization using the matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas packages run in Google Colaboratory (Python ver 3.10). 2.7. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. Once equal variance was confirmed, a t-test was performed to compare HU and matched control groups. This study involved an extended sampling period (3 years). To minimize batch effects, we compared HU and the matched controls for any given sex and timepoint since these groups were collected within the same period. Specifically, any HU group and its normally loaded control group (e.g., young male 14 day HU and NL groups) were euthanized on the same day or a day apart. Comparisons were not made across timepoints, sexes, or ages. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data shown are mean +/− S.D.",

With the exception of the 14-day HU young females, all HU groups had lower body weights versus age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1), consistent with previous reports [23,24,25]. Weight loss in HU groups of older males was transient, with body weights of NL and HU groups being comparable after 90 days of reambulation. Due to the modest decrease in body weight (10–13%), we do not expect weight loss to be a major confounding factor in other experimental outcomes. Figure 1.

The HU group was compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test. To determine whether simulated microgravity leads to alterations in redox balance in cardiac tissue, we measured levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in left ventricular tissue (Figure 2). 8-OHdG is a marker for oxidative damage to DNA. Young females after 14 days of HU displayed a modest yet statistically significant increase in 8-OHdG levels (33.2%) compared to age- and sex-matched controls. At 14 days of HU, no differences were observed between HU and control groups in young and older males. Older males at 90 days of HU did not exhibit any significant difference in 8-OHdG levels versus corresponding controls. We further hypothesized that reloading will lead to increased oxidative damage to hearts due to altered fluid distribution and increased functional demand on the heart. Hence, we examined 8-OHdG levels at an earlier timepoint of reambulation (7 days) where we found no differences in 8-OHdG levels in older males that underwent normal reambulation after 90 days of HU relative to controls. Figure 2. Open in a new tab 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in left ventricular tissue as measured by ELISA. NL: normally loaded control, HU: hindlimb unloading, 7D Rel: 90D HU + 7D reloading and normally loaded control (NL). The HU groups were compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test. To further assess any changes in key molecular determinants of redox balance, we measured gene expression levels of select antioxidant genes (Sod1 and Sod2) as well as a master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response, Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A–C). In addition, we examined the gene expression of Sirt1, a marker of cellular senescence and oxidative stress also known to impact longevity [26,27] (Figure 3D). Compared to sex- and age-matched controls, young females that underwent 14 days of HU did not show any changes in gene expression for any of the four genes tested. Young males at the same timepoint showed a modest downregulation of Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A) as well as upregulation of Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 3B and 3C respectively), but no change in Sirt1 expression (Figure 3D). In older males, Nfe2l2 was downregulated at 14 days of HU, while there were no changes in Sod1, Sod2, or Sirt1 expression. The downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression in older males persisted at 90 days of HU. After a 90-day reambulation period, this pattern was reversed, with HU groups showing upregulated expression of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 relative to controls. Figure 3.

Sample sizes: N = 3–7/group. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test by comparing HU with age- and sex-matched NL control. We reasoned that identifying the molecular signature of the early adaptation of cardiac tissue to HU will allow us to link early changes in gene expression and biological pathways to later cardiac outcomes. We therefore conducted transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) of tissue from the left ventricle in older (nine-month-old) males and their corresponding controls. We selected nine-month-old males for analysis (samples were not available for females of similar age) over the other three-month-old groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering generally indicated clustering by treatment group (Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively). A total of 125 genes were differentially expressed in the HU group relative to controls. Of these, 48 were upregulated and 77 were downregulated (Table 1). The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes included a number of immune-related genes such as Tlr8 and the macrophage/monocyte markers CD68 and CD163 as well as two circadian clock-related genes, Per3 and Arntl (Figure 6). Fifteen of these DEG’s were cluster-of-differentiation (CD) molecules belonging to the C-type lectin domain family, while 6 were LY6/PLAUR domain-containing members of the complement gene family (Table 2). Nfe2l2 did not appear as a downregulated gene in the 14D HU hearts of older males based on RNAseq despite the observed decrease (although modest) in transcript levels by qPCR analysis (Figure 3A, Table 1). This is likely due to differences in the normalization methods for the two assays. Figure 4.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The objective of this study was to determine the impact of simulated microgravity on redox signaling in the heart and the overall transcriptomic landscape. Our findings from a rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model for cephalad fluid shift and microgravity exposure suggest sex and age differences in oxidative stress responses. Young males displayed upregulation in the expression of the antioxidants Sod1 and Sod2, and a decrease in Nfe2l2 expression, with no changes in 8-OHdG levels. On the other hand, increased levels of the DNA oxidative marker 8-OHdG was observed in females that underwent 14 days of HU with no changes in the expression levels of the redox signaling-related genes examined. One interpretation of our findings is that during short-term HU, young males mitigate oxidative damage more effectively than young females. Alternatively, it is possible that the kinetics of the emergence and repair of oxidative damage are sexually dimorphic. It is also unclear whether sex differences in oxidative stress responses persist due to unavailability of samples at later timepoints. Further, short-term HU in older males does not appear to enhance oxidative damage. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward increased 8-OHdG in the older males that underwent 90 days of HU compared to controls. We cannot rule out the possibility that long-duration HU can increase oxidative damage in the hearts of older males due to the small sample size available to perform the 8-OHdG assay in these groups. At 14 days of HU, older males exhibited a downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression, while 8-OHdG levels were not different between HU and controls. The persistent downregulation of Nfe2l2 at this timepoint is consistent with the observed trend towards increased oxidative damage during prolonged HU. A 90 day reambulation period after prolonged HU of 90 days led to upregulated Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 expression. It is possible that upregulation of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms by which the heart can recover from extended durations of HU. We recognize the extended time period for the conduct of the HU experiments and varying sample sizes across groups as limitations of our study. Specifically, the interpretation of the results from the 8-OHdG and qPCR assays which were performed on multiple HU groups and their corresponding NL controls merits further study. Consistent with our findings, another group has reported that HU elicits an antioxidant response. In the hearts of 6-month-old mice, HU led to time-dependent increases in the oxidation of glutathione to glutathione disulfide, an indicator of oxidative damage [28]. Taken together, our findings and those of others support the use of antioxidant-based countermeasures for extended duration spaceflight. RNAseq results indicate that 14 days of HU in older males leads to enrichment of processes involved in the immune response, including complement activation and inflammation (Figure 7, Table S2). Complement activation, a component of innate immunity, is a mechanism by which the host defends against microbial infections. Studies in the last decade have revealed a role for the complement system in recognizing damaged host cells and coordinating with other elements of the immune response to achieve resolution to injury [29,30,31]. Dysregulated complement responses have been linked to autoimmune disease [32] as well as poor outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease [33,34,35] and related animal models [36,37]. Our results indicate upregulation of several complement genes. These include C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc, all components of the membrane attack complex, as well as C5ar1, the receptor for the complement anaphylatoxin 5a, which can stimulate immune cells in myocardial infarct models [29,36,37] (Table 1). The implication of upregulated complement response in cardiac tissue during simulated microgravity requires further study given the emerging role of the complement pathway in the development of cardiovascular disease [37,38]. Interestingly, in International Space Station (ISS) crew, elements of the complement response were found to be modestly increased within a week of return to Earth relative to pre-flight values [39]. However, the impact of actual flight on complement responses could not be evaluated, since no in-flight measures were reported in the said study. The underlying bases for the observed upregulation of complement genes in HU hearts is unclear. In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Complement activation also can occur as a response to pathogens or their constituents. Hence, another possibility that requires further study is the role of gut permeability in promoting a complement response during simulated microgravity. HU has been reported to alter the gut microbiome, cause damage to intestinal villi, and compromise the structural integrity of tight junctions [40], which can lead to gut leakiness. Indeed, HU can cause a transient release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in circulation and changes in the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes, [41] as well as an increase in circulating levels of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) [42]. Further, synthetic bacterial DNA has been shown to induce a robust inflammatory response in the heart of mice [43]. Consistent with a potential role of gut permeability, we found upregulation of CD14 in 14-day HU hearts. CD14 is a surface receptor expressed in circulating monocytes/macrophages, which binds to LPS to induce an immune response [44]. Other key genes involved in the inflammatory response were also upregulated after 14 days of HU, including CD163 and CD68. CD163 is a marker for activated macrophages. CD163+ macrophages promote angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration [45] and are increased in hearts of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys [46]. Further, CD68 marks the monocyte/macrophage population. Both expression levels of CD68 and immunopositive cell counts increase in the hearts of mice exposed to spaceflight-relevant doses (<0.5 Gy) of radiation [47]. In addition, HU in mice increased hippocampal CD68 levels, which mark activated microglial populations [48,49]. Collectively, the upregulation of CD14, CD68, and CD163 expression would be consistent with macrophage infiltration in HU hearts. Humans in future deep space missions will experience extended periods of low-dose space radiation and microgravity. Hence, the impact of the predicted upregulation of macrophage activity on human cardiovascular health requires further study. Tlr8 also was upregulated in the hearts of 14-day HU animals. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the important role of TLR signaling in the development of cardiovascular disease [50,51], whereas Tlr8 transcripts increased in patients with enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [52]. RNAseq results also suggest that HU in older males can perturb cardiac circadian clock signals. The circadian clock gene, Arntl (Bmal1), was the fourth most downregulated gene in the HU group, while Per3 was the most upregulated gene. Other circadian clock-related genes such as Per2 and Clock were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. There is a growing appreciation for the role of clock genes in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac-specific deletion of Arntl leads to congestive heart failure during aging, upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes in hearts and altered energy metabolism [53]. In addition, Per2 gene ablation worsens the inflammatory response to myocardial ischemia [54]. ISS crew experience circadian misalignment which leads to sleep–wake cycle disruption [55]. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2, Arntl, and Clock [56]. Taken together, our findings and those of others show the importance of exploring the role of circadian clock signaling in spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. RNAseq also revealed the enrichment of processes related to redox signaling, such as superoxide anion generation. Furthermore, 14 days of HU led to differential expression of a number of genes known to play a role in the defense against oxidative damage. In the current study, Clusterin (Clu), also known as Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), was upregulated after 14 days of HU. Overexpression of Clu in rat ventricular cells has been reported to rescue angiotensin II-induced ROS production and apoptosis [57]. Ucp3, a member of the family of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), was downregulated at 14 days of HU. UCPs have a number of functions, such as dissipating the proton gradient in the mitochondria, which reduces ATP production, releasing energy as heat, and also play a role in the regulation of redox balance [58]. Compared to wild-type controls, the hearts of Ucp3 knockout mice maintained in thermoneutral conditions have reduced mitochondrial complex activities as well as increased levels of ROS and oxidative stress markers [59]. Thus, the downregulation of Ucp3 in the hearts of HU rats suggests that simulated microgravity alters redox signaling and energetic processes in the mitochondria, consistent with findings from spaceflight and analog studies of other tissues [60,61]. Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (Rcan1), which is downregulated in hearts after 14 days of HU, plays a role in NFAT/Calcineurin signaling and is implicated in CVD progression [62,63]. Deletion of Rcan1 exacerbates the effects of septic cardiomyopathy and increases cardiac mitochondrial injury, as shown by elevated ROS levels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [62]. Taken together, our findings are in support of the hypothesis that simulated microgravity leads to altered redox signaling and function in the heart. In addition, these results are consistent with our earlier findings that hearts of mice that have been in space for 15 days show altered expression of genes regulating redox balance [64]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage. Therefore, our model predicts that in the absence of any mitigation strategies, extended spaceflight (>a year) may upregulate pro-inflammatory signaling in cardiac tissue. Consistent with our hypothesis, simulated microgravity led to enhanced expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Therefore, mitigating excessive inflammation and ensuring optimum antioxidant defenses (e.g., via dietary supplementation) may be a useful approach to ensure long-term cardiac health in astronauts during deep space missions. The upregulation of complement activation genes in hearts of rodents exposed to HU needs further study to determine its underlying basis and long-term consequences for cardiac health. In addition, we have identified the molecular signature of cardiac tissue responses to HU. A subset of these differentially expressed genes could be tested as candidate circulating biomarkers for monitoring the trajectory of an astronaut’s response to spaceflight or predicting the need for medical intervention.",

Copyright notice ID: 11353732 PMID: 39202335 Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, microgravity, cardiovascular system, immune response, transcriptomics1. Introduction Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2 levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+ signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19]. Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female and male Long–Evans rats (Taconic) were selected for this study. Animals were group-housed in standard vivarium cages until the onset of HU. A group of females and males (referred to as “young”) underwent HU at three months of age, while a group of retired male breeders (referred to as “older males”) began HU at nine months of age. Normally loaded (NL) controls were individually housed in standard vivarium cages. Animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously [11]. NL controls were handled the same way as the HU animals except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. HU was conducted for either 14 days or 90 days. A subset of nine-month-old (older) males that underwent HU for 90 days were then released from the suspension apparatus to reambulate normally (Reloading, Rel) for 90 days. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. Enrichment consisted of Diamond Twists paper sticks (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and I-Chews (Newco, Hayward, CA, USA) and replenished as needed. Room temperature was maintained within a range of 20–26 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. After the designated duration of HU, animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose followed by exsanguination and decapitation. Tissues were collected shortly thereafter. Hearts were bisected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Refer to Table S1 for the sample sizes of the experiment groups included in this study. Young male and female, 90 day HU, and recovery groups were not included in the study either due to insufficient sample sizes or unavailability of appropriately processed samples.2.2. Processing of Frozen Heart Samples Frozen hearts were retrieved from −80 °C storage and placed on a metal platform that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Left ventricular tissue was excised from the anterior to posterior ends (apex) of the heart. The excised left ventricular tissue was further cut into thirds (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior and posterior thirds were processed for DNA and RNA extraction, respectively. Samples were excluded from analyses if anatomical landmarks could not be conclusively identified for isolation of left ventricular tissue.2.3. RNA Extraction from Cardiac Tissue Total RNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and purity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples showing an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 were used for RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).2.4. cDNA Synthesis and qPCR First-strand DNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows. A total of 450 ng of RNA was used for a 30 uL first strand synthesis. Briefly, 1.5 uL of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# N8080127), 1.5 μL dNTPs (Qiagen, Cat# 1005631), and 12 μL of water were mixed, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. A solution-containing 3 μL RNase-free water, 6 μL 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Cat# Y02321), 3 μL DTT (Invitrogen, Cat# Y00147), and 1.5 μL RNase Out (Invitrogen, Cat# 100000840) was added to the abovementioned mix and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Then 1.5 μL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 28025013) was added to the resulting solution and incubated as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. All incubation steps were performed using a TC-312 thermocycler (Techne, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). First-strand DNA was stored at −80 °C until use for qPCR using the Taqman system. Multiplex PCR reactions were set up to measure both genes of interest and housekeeping gene expression in the same well of a 384-well plate. A premade gene expression master mix (Taqman, LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 4369016) was utilized, and each reaction was completed in duplicate. FAM-labeled Taqman probes (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the following genes of interest: nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2, Rn00582415_m1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, Rn00566938_m1), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2, Rn00690588_g1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, Rn01428096_m1). VIC-labeled ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19, Rn00821265_g1) was used as housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression levels for HU groups relative to age- and sex-matched controls were determined by the ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change.2.5. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) Assay Total DNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of 8-OHdG was performed using OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# STA-320) following manufacturer’s specifications. Enzyme reaction/absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Softmax Pro 5 software.2.6. RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Poly(A)+-enriched cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) instrument to generate 75 bp single-end reads. Sequencing data quality was checked using FastQC (version 0.11.5) software. Subsequently, reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using STAR (version 2.6.0c). Then, a matrix of read counts per gene was generated using “featureCounts” from the Rsubread package (version 1.30.5). Genes with low expression values were filtered from downstream analysis by requiring more than 5 reads in at least 6 samples for each gene. Subsequently, between-sample normalization was performed using EDASeq (version 2.16.0). One sample from each group had to be excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Hence, 6 samples per group were used for the succeeding analysis. RUVseq (version 1.16.0) [RUVs with k = 4] was used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. Genes differentially expressed between HU and control samples were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2), controlling for factors of unwanted variation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and heat maps generated using Morpheus, with Pearson method selected [20]. RStudio analysis software (Version 1.1.419), together with ggplot2 (version 3.1.1), ggrepel (version 0.8.0), and Bioconductor (DESeq2 version 1.22.2) packages, were used to obtain principal component analysis plots. For gene enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes meeting a log2 fold change cut-off of >0.3 or <−0.3 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were input into Toppfun [21,22]. Toppfun was used to assess functional enrichment of DEGs based on ontologies, gene family, phenotype (human disease), and pharmacome (drug–gene associations). Of the 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 121 matched the contents of the Toppfun database and were therefore included in the list for gene enrichment analysis. The DEGs that had no match in the Toppfun database were Clec4a1, Lilrb3l, Fcna, and Mill1. Gene enrichment analysis was performed at a false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg) of <0.05 and a gene limit of 2 or greater. GO Terms were plotted for visualization using the matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas packages run in Google Colaboratory (Python ver 3.10).2.7. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. Once equal variance was confirmed, a t-test was performed to compare HU and matched control groups. This study involved an extended sampling period (3 years). To minimize batch effects, we compared HU and the matched controls for any given sex and timepoint since these groups were collected within the same period. Specifically, any HU group and its normally loaded control group (e.g., young male 14 day HU and NL groups) were euthanized on the same day or a day apart. Comparisons were not made across timepoints, sexes, or ages. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data shown are mean +/− S.D.3. Results In this study, we made use of the rodent HU model to gain insight on the effects of microgravity exposure on molecular signatures of the heart. With the exception of the 14-day HU young females, all HU groups had lower body weights versus age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1), consistent with previous reports [23,24,25]. Weight loss in HU groups of older males was transient, with body weights of NL and HU groups being comparable after 90 days of reambulation. Due to the modest decrease in body weight (10–13%), we do not expect weight loss to be a major confounding factor in other experimental outcomes. Figure 1.

Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.To determine whether simulated microgravity leads to alterations in redox balance in cardiac tissue, we measured levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in left ventricular tissue (Figure 2). 8-OHdG is a marker for oxidative damage to DNA. Young females after 14 days of HU displayed a modest yet statistically significant increase in 8-OHdG levels (33.2%) compared to age- and sex-matched controls. At 14 days of HU, no differences were observed between HU and control groups in young and older males. Older males at 90 days of HU did not exhibit any significant difference in 8-OHdG levels versus corresponding controls. We further hypothesized that reloading will lead to increased oxidative damage to hearts due to altered fluid distribution and increased functional demand on the heart. Hence, we examined 8-OHdG levels at an earlier timepoint of reambulation (7 days) where we found no differences in 8-OHdG levels in older males that underwent normal reambulation after 90 days of HU relative to controls. Figure 2. Open in a new tab 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in left ventricular tissue as measured by ELISA.

Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.To further assess any changes in key molecular determinants of redox balance, we measured gene expression levels of select antioxidant genes (Sod1 and Sod2) as well as a master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response, Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A–C). In addition, we examined the gene expression of Sirt1, a marker of cellular senescence and oxidative stress also known to impact longevity [26,27] (Figure 3D). Compared to sex- and age-matched controls, young females that underwent 14 days of HU did not show any changes in gene expression for any of the four genes tested. Young males at the same timepoint showed a modest downregulation of Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A) as well as upregulation of Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 3B and 3C respectively), but no change in Sirt1 expression (Figure 3D). In older males, Nfe2l2 was downregulated at 14 days of HU, while there were no changes in Sod1, Sod2, or Sirt1 expression. The downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression in older males persisted at 90 days of HU. After a 90-day reambulation period, this pattern was reversed, with HU groups showing upregulated expression of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 relative to controls. Figure 3.

Sample sizes: N = 3–7/group. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test by comparing HU with age- and sex-matched NL control.We reasoned that identifying the molecular signature of the early adaptation of cardiac tissue to HU will allow us to link early changes in gene expression and biological pathways to later cardiac outcomes. We therefore conducted transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) of tissue from the left ventricle in older (nine-month-old) males and their corresponding controls. We selected nine-month-old males for analysis (samples were not available for females of similar age) over the other three-month-old groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering generally indicated clustering by treatment group (Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively). A total of 125 genes were differentially expressed in the HU group relative to controls. Of these, 48 were upregulated and 77 were downregulated (Table 1). The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes included a number of immune-related genes such as Tlr8 and the macrophage/monocyte markers CD68 and CD163 as well as two circadian clock-related genes, Per3 and Arntl (Figure 6). Fifteen of these DEG’s were cluster-of-differentiation (CD) molecules belonging to the C-type lectin domain family, while 6 were LY6/PLAUR domain-containing members of the complement gene family (Table 2). Nfe2l2 did not appear as a downregulated gene in the 14D HU hearts of older males based on RNAseq despite the observed decrease (although modest) in transcript levels by qPCR analysis (Figure 3A, Table 1). This is likely due to differences in the normalization methods for the two assays. Figure 4.

Discussion The objective of this study was to determine the impact of simulated microgravity on redox signaling in the heart and the overall transcriptomic landscape. Our findings from a rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model for cephalad fluid shift and microgravity exposure suggest sex and age differences in oxidative stress responses. Young males displayed upregulation in the expression of the antioxidants Sod1 and Sod2, and a decrease in Nfe2l2 expression, with no changes in 8-OHdG levels. On the other hand, increased levels of the DNA oxidative marker 8-OHdG was observed in females that underwent 14 days of HU with no changes in the expression levels of the redox signaling-related genes examined. One interpretation of our findings is that during short-term HU, young males mitigate oxidative damage more effectively than young females. Alternatively, it is possible that the kinetics of the emergence and repair of oxidative damage are sexually dimorphic. It is also unclear whether sex differences in oxidative stress responses persist due to unavailability of samples at later timepoints. Further, short-term HU in older males does not appear to enhance oxidative damage. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward increased 8-OHdG in the older males that underwent 90 days of HU compared to controls. We cannot rule out the possibility that long-duration HU can increase oxidative damage in the hearts of older males due to the small sample size available to perform the 8-OHdG assay in these groups. At 14 days of HU, older males exhibited a downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression, while 8-OHdG levels were not different between HU and controls. The persistent downregulation of Nfe2l2 at this timepoint is consistent with the observed trend towards increased oxidative damage during prolonged HU. A 90 day reambulation period after prolonged HU of 90 days led to upregulated Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 expression. It is possible that upregulation of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms by which the heart can recover from extended durations of HU. We recognize the extended time period for the conduct of the HU experiments and varying sample sizes across groups as limitations of our study. Specifically, the interpretation of the results from the 8-OHdG and qPCR assays which were performed on multiple HU groups and their corresponding NL controls merits further study. Consistent with our findings, another group has reported that HU elicits an antioxidant response. In the hearts of 6-month-old mice, HU led to time-dependent increases in the oxidation of glutathione to glutathione disulfide, an indicator of oxidative damage [28]. Taken together, our findings and those of others support the use of antioxidant-based countermeasures for extended duration spaceflight. RNAseq results indicate that 14 days of HU in older males leads to enrichment of processes involved in the immune response, including complement activation and inflammation (Figure 7, Table S2). Complement activation, a component of innate immunity, is a mechanism by which the host defends against microbial infections. Studies in the last decade have revealed a role for the complement system in recognizing damaged host cells and coordinating with other elements of the immune response to achieve resolution to injury [29,30,31]. Dysregulated complement responses have been linked to autoimmune disease [32] as well as poor outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease [33,34,35] and related animal models [36,37]. Our results indicate upregulation of several complement genes. These include C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc, all components of the membrane attack complex, as well as C5ar1, the receptor for the complement anaphylatoxin 5a, which can stimulate immune cells in myocardial infarct models [29,36,37] (Table 1). The implication of upregulated complement response in cardiac tissue during simulated microgravity requires further study given the emerging role of the complement pathway in the development of cardiovascular disease [37,38]. Interestingly, in International Space Station (ISS) crew, elements of the complement response were found to be modestly increased within a week of return to Earth relative to pre-flight values [39]. However, the impact of actual flight on complement responses could not be evaluated, since no in-flight measures were reported in the said study. The underlying bases for the observed upregulation of complement genes in HU hearts is unclear. In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Complement activation also can occur as a response to pathogens or their constituents. Hence, another possibility that requires further study is the role of gut permeability in promoting a complement response during simulated microgravity. HU has been reported to alter the gut microbiome, cause damage to intestinal villi, and compromise the structural integrity of tight junctions [40], which can lead to gut leakiness. Indeed, HU can cause a transient release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in circulation and changes in the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes, [41] as well as an increase in circulating levels of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) [42]. Further, synthetic bacterial DNA has been shown to induce a robust inflammatory response in the heart of mice [43]. Consistent with a potential role of gut permeability, we found upregulation of CD14 in 14-day HU hearts. CD14 is a surface receptor expressed in circulating monocytes/macrophages, which binds to LPS to induce an immune response [44]. Other key genes involved in the inflammatory response were also upregulated after 14 days of HU, including CD163 and CD68. CD163 is a marker for activated macrophages. CD163+ macrophages promote angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration [45] and are increased in hearts of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys [46]. Further, CD68 marks the monocyte/macrophage population. Both expression levels of CD68 and immunopositive cell counts increase in the hearts of mice exposed to spaceflight-relevant doses (<0.5 Gy) of radiation [47]. In addition, HU in mice increased hippocampal CD68 levels, which mark activated microglial populations [48,49]. Collectively, the upregulation of CD14, CD68, and CD163 expression would be consistent with macrophage infiltration in HU hearts. Humans in future deep space missions will experience extended periods of low-dose space radiation and microgravity. Hence, the impact of the predicted upregulation of macrophage activity on human cardiovascular health requires further study. Tlr8 also was upregulated in the hearts of 14-day HU animals. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the important role of TLR signaling in the development of cardiovascular disease [50,51], whereas Tlr8 transcripts increased in patients with enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [52]. RNAseq results also suggest that HU in older males can perturb cardiac circadian clock signals. The circadian clock gene, Arntl (Bmal1), was the fourth most downregulated gene in the HU group, while Per3 was the most upregulated gene. Other circadian clock-related genes such as Per2 and Clock were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. There is a growing appreciation for the role of clock genes in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac-specific deletion of Arntl leads to congestive heart failure during aging, upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes in hearts and altered energy metabolism [53]. In addition, Per2 gene ablation worsens the inflammatory response to myocardial ischemia [54]. ISS crew experience circadian misalignment which leads to sleep–wake cycle disruption [55]. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2, Arntl, and Clock [56]. Taken together, our findings and those of others show the importance of exploring the role of circadian clock signaling in spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. RNAseq also revealed the enrichment of processes related to redox signaling, such as superoxide anion generation. Furthermore, 14 days of HU led to differential expression of a number of genes known to play a role in the defense against oxidative damage. In the current study, Clusterin (Clu), also known as Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), was upregulated after 14 days of HU. Overexpression of Clu in rat ventricular cells has been reported to rescue angiotensin II-induced ROS production and apoptosis [57]. Ucp3, a member of the family of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), was downregulated at 14 days of HU. UCPs have a number of functions, such as dissipating the proton gradient in the mitochondria, which reduces ATP production, releasing energy as heat, and also play a role in the regulation of redox balance [58]. Compared to wild-type controls, the hearts of Ucp3 knockout mice maintained in thermoneutral conditions have reduced mitochondrial complex activities as well as increased levels of ROS and oxidative stress markers [59]. Thus, the downregulation of Ucp3 in the hearts of HU rats suggests that simulated microgravity alters redox signaling and energetic processes in the mitochondria, consistent with findings from spaceflight and analog studies of other tissues [60,61]. Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (Rcan1), which is downregulated in hearts after 14 days of HU, plays a role in NFAT/Calcineurin signaling and is implicated in CVD progression [62,63]. Deletion of Rcan1 exacerbates the effects of septic cardiomyopathy and increases cardiac mitochondrial injury, as shown by elevated ROS levels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [62]. Taken together, our findings are in support of the hypothesis that simulated microgravity leads to altered redox signaling and function in the heart. In addition, these results are consistent with our earlier findings that hearts of mice that have been in space for 15 days show altered expression of genes regulating redox balance [64]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage. Therefore, our model predicts that in the absence of any mitigation strategies, extended spaceflight (>a year) may upregulate pro-inflammatory signaling in cardiac tissue. Consistent with our hypothesis, simulated microgravity led to enhanced expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Therefore, mitigating excessive inflammation and ensuring optimum antioxidant defenses (e.g., via dietary supplementation) may be a useful approach to ensure long-term cardiac health in astronauts during deep space missions. The upregulation of complement activation genes in hearts of rodents exposed to HU needs further study to determine its underlying basis and long-term consequences for cardiac health. In addition, we have identified the molecular signature of cardiac tissue responses to HU. A subset of these differentially expressed genes could be tested as candidate circulating biomarkers for monitoring the trajectory of an astronaut’s response to spaceflight or predicting the need for medical intervention.Acknowledgments We are grateful to April Ronca and other members of Ames SC Division for coordinating this NASA-funded tissue-sharing opportunity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.

    "introduction": "Introduction Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 800 million individuals globally1. It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months2. Historically, the management of CKD primarily focused on delaying renal failure, implementing end-stage dialysis, or pursuing renal transplantation3. However, recent advancements in the field have led researchers to explore pharmacological interventions, such as empagliflozin, which has shown promise in decelerating CKD progression and mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with the condition4. Despite advancements in medical research, effective treatments for CKD remain elusive. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD treatment are imperative. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence gene expression levels, present a promising avenue for this endeavor. Utilizing MR analysis of druggable genes, cis-eQTLs—SNPs located in the proximal genomic regions of target genes and closely associated with their expression—serve as instrumental variables (IVs) to elucidate causal relationships between druggable genes and CKD. This approach facilitates the identification of potential drug targets for CKD treatment. This approach has also found extensive application in the investigation of various other diseases5–7. Mendelian Randomization (MR), a statistical technique that leverages genetic variation as an instrumental variable, has demonstrated significant potential in recent years for causal inference in the context of complex diseases8. By utilizing genetic variants that exhibit strong correlations with exposure factors as IVs, MR facilitates the assessment of causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding variables. Consequently, MR analyses is frequently employed to evaluate etiological inferences in epidemiological research9,10. Importantly, the effectiveness of MR analyses parallels that of randomized controlled trials, albeit with reduced bias and the elimination of reverse causality (Fig. 1)11. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The principle of Mendelian randomization analysis is shown in the figure, where instrumental variables can represent exposure (druggable gene), are independent of confounding factors, and do not directly affect outcomes (Chronic kidney disease).",
    "methods": "Methods Study design In this MR analysis, we selected cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes as the exposure variable and employed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for CKD from the FinnGen database as the outcome variable. This approach was designed to elucidate the complex relationship between the expression of druggable genes and CKD. To identify the most suitable SNPs as instrumental variables, we conducted association analyses of the exposure factors and established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. A series of sensitivity analyses was implemented in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of the MR analysis. Furthermore, to elucidate the functional roles of the significant genes identified through MR analysis in terms of cellular composition, biological processes, and molecular functions, as well as to interpret the biological pathways they are involved in according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), we performed comprehensive functional annotations. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses on these significant genes, and provided detailed information regarding their chromosomal positions. Additionally, we performed colocalization analysis to evaluate whether cis-eQTL and CKD share the same causal variants. The overall design idea is detailed in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The overall design of this study is shown in the figure. Data sources By comparing the sequences and structures of proteins present in human blood with those of currently identified drug target proteins, scientists identified several proteins that exhibit structural similarity to known drug targets and possess the potential to be modulated by drug-like small molecules. Consequently, scientists identified a specific group of genes for further investigation12. Finan identified 1,427 genes encoding drug targets that have been approved or are in the clinical phase, 682 genes encoding proteins that bind to known drug molecules or are similar to approved drug targets, and 2,370 genes that are members of a family of key druggable genes or encode proteins that are distantly similar to approved drug targets12. These 4,479 druggable genes have also been utilized by researchers to investigate potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis (Supplementary Material: Table S1)5. (Supplementary Material: Table S1). We queried the eQTLGen Consortium database for these 4,479 druggable genes and retrieved blood cis-eQTL data for 2,888 of them13. The eQTL data facilitated the identification of genetic variants associated with gene expression levels in blood samples, specifically those variants located within 1 Mb of the central location of each gene. FinnGen is a well-known and large database, and FinnGen provides genetic insights from a phenotypically well-defined and isolated population14. The CKD outcome data were derived from the FinnGen database, which collected information on 447,473 individuals, including 11,265 in the case group and 436,208 in the control group. Selection of instrumental variables Reliable and accurate instrumental variables are characterized by three distinctive features:1 a very strong association with the exposure2, no relationship with confounders other than the exposure, and3 the absence of horizontal pleiotropy. It is essential to note that horizontal pleiotropy should be entirely absent in MR analyses. To identify IVs meeting these criteria, we conducted a rigorous screening of each druggable gene. Initially, we performed association analyses to select SNPs from the cis-eQTL data, ensuring that only SNPs with P-values below the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 × 10− 8) were considered. Secondly, to mitigate the knock-on disequilibrium effects of these SNPs, we utilized the “TwoSampleMR” package in the R programming language to set the linkage disequilibrium (LD) threshold to R² < 0.1, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project (EUR population) with an aggregation distance of 10,000 kb15. In addition, we calculated the proportion of variance explained (R2) and the F statistic to quantify the strength of the tool with the following equations: R2 = 2 × MAF × (1 - MAF) × β2, and F = R2(n-k-1)/ k(1-R2), where “MAF” is the SNP used as the IV secondary allele frequency, “n” is the sample size, “k” is the number of IVs used16. To avoid weak IV bias, we selected SNPs with F > 10 as the IVs we analysed. Mendelian randomization analysis MR analyses were conducted using the “TwoSampleMR” package in R (version 4.4.1). For the MR analysis, the Wald ratio method was employed when a single SNP served as the IV. When the IV comprised two or more SNPs, we applied five different methods: inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. We used the IVW method as the primary analysis method because previous studies have shown that the IVW method is more conservative but more robust17. To account for multiple testing, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to identify significant MR analysis results. Additionally, to ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed several methods for sensitivity analyses. Potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q test18. Heterogeneity was considered absent if the p-value of the Cochrane Q test exceeded 0.05. Potential pleiotropy between exposure and outcome was examined using MR-Egger regression. Pleiotropy was considered absent if the p-value for the MR-Egger regression intercept was greater than 0.0518. Colocalization For druggable genes showing significant MR results, colocalization analysis was performed using the R package “coloc“19. The default a priori probabilities were P1 = 1.0 × 10− 4, P2 = 1.0 × 10− 4, and P12 = 1.0 × 10− 5, indicating that the SNPs were associated with the expression of the druggable genes, the outcome, or both, respectively. Posterior probabilities for the following five hypotheses were generated from the colocalization analysis: PPH 0, not associated with the expression or outcome of a druggable gene; PPH 1, associated with the expression of a druggable gene but not with the outcome; PPH 2, associated with the outcome but not with the expression of a druggable gene; PPH 3, associated with the expression and outcome of a druggable gene with a different causal variant; and PPH 4, association with expression of the druggable genes and outcome, with a shared causal variant. PPH 4 > 0.80 was considered strong. Gene function and pathway enrichment analysis GO is the world’s largest source of information on gene function. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is the basis for large-scale computational analyses20,21. KEGG is a database for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems from molecular-level information22–24. For biological process and pathway enrichment analyses, KEGG and GO analyses were performed using the R “clusterProfiler” software package. Finally, the R “circlize” package was used25 to display information on the location of these genes on the corresponding chromosomes.",
    "results": "Results Twelve significant genes were identified by MR analysis of druggable genes We employed the IVW method as the primary analytical approach. Sixteen druggable genes exhibited a strong association with the development of CKD at a FDR of less than 0.05. These genes are PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, C4A, S100B, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, C4B, XYLT1, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8. To assess the pleiotropy of these 16 significant genes, we utilized MR-Egger regression. The intercept p-value for “S100B” was less than 0.05, indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Conversely, the intercept p-values for the remaining 15 significant genes were greater than 0.05, suggesting no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for these genes. The potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q-test. The results indicated significant heterogeneity for the IVs associated with “C4A,” “C4B,” and “XYLT1,” while no evidence of heterogeneity was found for the other significant genes. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we did not accept the presence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Consequently, we concluded that a causal association exists between 12 genes—PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8—and CKD (Fig. 3). It is worth mentioning that the MR-PRESSO test revealed no evidence of pleiotropy among these 12 significant genes. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab The 12 druggable genes are closely related to the risk of CKD after FDR correction. If OR is greater than 1, the gene is considered to be positively correlated with the occurrence of CKD, and if it is less than 1, it is considered to be negatively correlated. FDR is the corrected p-value, and FDR is greater than 0.05, which is considered statistically significant.Among these 12 significant genes, TUBB (OR: 1.2352; 95% CI: 1.1305–1.3496; FDR = 0.0085), PTPN22 (OR: 1.2897; 95% CI: 1.1893–1.3985; FDR < 0.001), MAP2K5 (OR: 1.1055; 95% CI: 1.0679–1.1445; FDR < 0.001), CHSY1 (OR: 1.1152; 95% CI: 1.0667–1.1659; FDR = 0.0044), DHFR (OR: 1.0390; 95% CI: 1.0214–1.0570; FDR = 0.0347), CXCR1 (OR: 1.1188; 95% CI: 1.0634–1.1771; FDR = 0.0430) and CD96 (OR: 1.0945; 95% CI: 1.0505–1.1404; FDR = 0.0475) expression were positively correlated with the risk of CKD. KSR1 (OR: 0.8809; 95% CI: 0.8441–0.9192; FDR < 0.001), CASP9 (OR: 0.8782; 95% CI: 0.8389–0.9195; FDR < 0.001), MYLK4 (OR: 0.9078; 95% CI: 0.8744–0.9423; FDR = 0.0011), GUCY1B2 (OR: 0.9068; 95% CI: 0.8679–0.9475; FDR = 0.0359) and VAMP8 (OR: 0.9215; 95% CI: 0.8879–0.9565; FDR = 0.0489) expression were negatively associated with CKD risk. (Information on the IVs used for these significant genes is detailed in Supplementary Material Table S2, and the results of MR analyses are detailed in Supplementary Material Table S3) Colocalization analysis of 12 significant genes Colocalization analysis can provide additional evidence for Mendelian randomization analysis, suggesting that associations between instrumental variables used for analysis and outcomes may be causal. Colocalization supports both an association between genetic variation and exposure and an association between exposure and outcome. When colocalization analyses show positive results, specific genetic variants share the same genetic location as signals associated with both exposure and outcome, this strengthens the belief that the association is due to genetic variants directly affecting exposure, and thus outcome. In addition, it reduces the likelihood of pleiotropy to some extent. In order to strengthen the evidence for an association between these key genes and CKD. For the 12 genes, we performed colocalization analyses to estimate the likelihood that the cis-eQTL and CKD results share a causal variant. The result of colocalization analysis indicated that CKD and TUBB genes might share a causal variant, with PP.H4 exceeding 0.80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Consequently, based on MR and colocalization analyses, we infer that TUBB is statistically likely to be a potential drug target for CKD treatment. (For details of the results of significant gene colocalization analysis, see Table S4 in the Supplementary Material) Demonstrate information about key genes on the corresponding chromosome The position of a gene on a chromosome may be related to its function, expression regulation, and interactions with other genes. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about their potential involvement in specific biological processes or pathways. Besides, many genetic disorders are associated with abnormalities in specific genes or gene clusters on chromosomes. Knowing the chromosomal location of these genes helps identify genetic variations related to diseases, providing important information for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Moreover, chromosomes are carriers of genetic information, and their structure, organization, and evolution are crucial for understanding the functional and evolutionary history of an organism’s genome. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about genome structure, chromosomal rearrangements, and evolutionary events. So, we show the information of the starting position of the remarkable genes on specific chromosomes. For example, the TUBB gene is located on chromosome 6 in the segment 30,687,978–30,693,203, and the PTPN22 gene is located on chromosome 1 in the segment 114,356,433–1,144,414,381 (Fig. 4). (Seeing Supplementary Material Table S1 for details). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab This figure shows the relationship between significant genes and chromosome positions. For example, TUBB is located on chromosome 6. Analysis of specific biological processes, functional classes and signalling pathways corresponding to key genes by GO/KEGG enrichment GO enrichment analysis showed that in the Biological Process module, these genes were mainly enriched on regulation of MAP kinase activity and regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity. In the Cellular Component module, these genes were mainly enriched in primary lysosome. In the molecular Function Module, these genes were mainly enriched on protein serine kinase activity (Fig. 5). KEGG pathway analyses showed that these genes were mainly enriched on Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway (Fig. 6). (For details of the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, please refer to Table S5 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Material.) Fig. 5. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of GO enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, in the Biological Process module, there are three significant genes enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity.Fig. 6. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of KEGG enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, there are two significant genes enriched in Gap junction.Notably, TUBB was pathway linked to Cellular community - eukaryotes, Infectious disease/bacterial, and Cellular Processes. In GO enrichment analysis, TUBB was associated with natural killer cell mediated immunity, leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, primary lysosome, azurophil granule, nuclear envelope lumen, spindle, intercellular bridge, GTPase activating protein binding, MHC class I protein binding, and MHC protein binding and other related.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we found that the expression of 12 genes was closely related to CKD. For genes demonstrating significant associations in the MR analysis, we performed a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses and functional assessments. These included Cochrane’s Q-test, MR-Egger regression, colocalization analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the expression of the TUBB gene and CKD. MR analysis of druggable genes, along with colocalization analysis, has yielded compelling evidence suggesting that TUBB is a potential therapeutic target for CKD. The TUBB gene encodes β-tubulin, a structural component of microtubules that binds to α-tubulin to form a heterodimer, which subsequently contributes to microtubule assembly26. Microtubules (MTs) have been characterized as long, hollow polymers with a diameter of 25 nm and lengths ranging from less than 1 μm to over 100 μm. They were initially described as consisting of approximately 13 linear protofilaments, forming a polymer with a fast-growing positive end (exposed β-tubulin) and a slow-growing negative end (exposed α-tubulin)27. MTs are integral to the formation of cellular structures and the regulation of cellular functions, such as cell polarity and morphology, chromosome segregation during cell division, and the localization and transport of organelles28. Furthermore, MTs facilitate intracellular transport, assemble into larger structures with the aid of auxiliary proteins, and interact with various cell types to establish mature networks27. It has been proposed that microtubule-targeting compounds inhibit microtubule polymerization, thereby causing an imbalance in microtubule dynamics. This disruption results in spindle apparatus damage, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately, tumor cell death29. Consequently, compounds that target microtubules are capable of inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It is apparent that these compounds can interfere with a range of critical cellular processes30. Among the proteins constituting microtubules, β-tubulin is particularly significant. During microtubule polymerization, only the β-tubulin subunit is capable of hydrolyzing GTP following the incorporation of microtubule dimers31. This underscores the critical role of TUBB and its encoded β-tubulin proteins in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and human immunity. Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) developed based on β-tubulin proteins have a longstanding history and are considered among the earliest anti-cancer drugs30. For instance, compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine, and vindesine target the Vinca domain located at the inter-dimer interface between two longitudinally aligned tubulin dimers within the β-tubulin monomer32–34. Additionally, colchicine, benzimidazoles, and combretastatins interact with the colchicine binding sites situated in the deep pocket between αβ-tubulin dimers within β-tubulin monomers35. Furthermore, binding to the Taxane site of β-tubulin monomers in the inner lumen of MTs stabilizes the MT lattice. Consequently, MT-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epoxomicin have been developed36. Secondly, Maytansine and Spongistatin interact near the Vinca site on the exposed pocket of β-tubulin37,38. Similarly, the compounds Laulimalide and Peloruside target β-tubulin protein pockets oriented towards the exterior of microtubules (MTs)39,40. In 2021, the Gatorbulin site was identified, located within the α-tubulin subunit, between α- and β-tubulin, and proximal to the colchicine site. This site functions to form a wedge between two longitudinally aligned MT dimers at the MT terminus41. Recently, a novel compound named Cevipabulin has been reported to bind to this pocket42. The numerous sites of targeted drug development, whether currently known or unknown, associated with TUBB present substantial opportunities for TUBB to be considered a potential drug target in CKD. As discussed above, TUBB gene expression produces β - tubulin, which is involved in the composition of microtubules. Meanwhile, microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) interact with microtubules, such as participating in microtubule binding, regulating microtubule stability, polymerization, and depolymerization processes. They interact with each other and jointly participate in maintaining the cytoskeleton structure and cell morphology within the cell24. This is similar to our GO/KEGG enrichment analysis results, where in the Biological process module, these genes are mainly enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity. The relationship between GTPase activating protein (GAP) and microtubule proteins is close, and the microtubule network formed by the β - microtubule protein encoded by the TUBB gene can serve as a transport track and localization platform for signaling molecules28. This is similar to the results of our KEGG enrichment analysis, which mainly concentrates on the Gap junction. These β-tubulin protein-based microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) play a crucial role in tumor treatment by disrupting microtubule homeostasis within the spindle apparatus, thereby activating mitotic checkpoints. This disruption arrests cells at the mid-stage of mitosis, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis43,44. Additionally, these agents have demonstrated efficacy against parasites45. Recent research has indicated that TUBB, a microtubule protein, may play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying various renal diseases, including tubulointerstitial disease and renal fibrosis. For instance, Sang et al. demonstrated that the inhibition of microtubule dynamics hinders the repair of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and promotes renal fibrosis46. Additionally, Yang et al. identified β-tubulin as a serum marker for renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that this type of carcinoma is associated with elevated TUBB expression47. Although there is a paucity of comprehensive studies specifically addressing the relationship between TUBB and CKD, emerging research has increasingly concentrated on the interplay between MTs and their associated proteins in the context of CKD. A cross-sectional study has identified β-tubulin as a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment in CKD patients48. Additionally, recent findings indicate that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) mini-nuclear host gene 12 exacerbates inflammation and apoptosis while inhibiting autophagy in acute kidney injury by upregulating TUBB expression49. This finding aligns with the results of our analysis, which demonstrated a positive association between TUBB expression and CKD risk. Consequently, we propose that TUBB represents a potential therapeutic target for CKD, meriting further in-depth investigation into its underlying mechanisms. Apart from TUBB, several other potential targets were identified (Fig. 3). Although these additional significant genes were not corroborated by colocalization analysis, the important value of them cannot be entirely dismissed, and they continue to present a broad spectrum of possibilities for CKD drug development. Despite our rigorous analytical approach, which included the exclusion of results exhibiting heterogeneity and pleiotropy (including horizontal pleiotropy), our study has certain limitations. Firstly, our findings are based on statistical extrapolation, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where other confounding factors may interfere. Consequently, our results cannot entirely substitute for basic or clinical trials, nor can they guarantee the actual efficacy of the drug. Therefore, further basic and clinical research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms and effects of TUBB on CKD. Besides, the current analysis is ethnically constrained, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Importantly, our study offers significant insights and guidance for advancing research on identifying drug targets for CKD.",

Copyright notice ID: 11953390 PMID: 40155631 Abstract Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.

It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months2. Historically, the management of CKD primarily focused on delaying renal failure, implementing end-stage dialysis, or pursuing renal transplantation3. However, recent advancements in the field have led researchers to explore pharmacological interventions, such as empagliflozin, which has shown promise in decelerating CKD progression and mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with the condition4. Despite advancements in medical research, effective treatments for CKD remain elusive. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD treatment are imperative. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence gene expression levels, present a promising avenue for this endeavor. Utilizing MR analysis of druggable genes, cis-eQTLs—SNPs located in the proximal genomic regions of target genes and closely associated with their expression—serve as instrumental variables (IVs) to elucidate causal relationships between druggable genes and CKD. This approach facilitates the identification of potential drug targets for CKD treatment. This approach has also found extensive application in the investigation of various other diseases5–7. Mendelian Randomization (MR), a statistical technique that leverages genetic variation as an instrumental variable, has demonstrated significant potential in recent years for causal inference in the context of complex diseases8. By utilizing genetic variants that exhibit strong correlations with exposure factors as IVs, MR facilitates the assessment of causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding variables. Consequently, MR analyses is frequently employed to evaluate etiological inferences in epidemiological research9,10. Importantly, the effectiveness of MR analyses parallels that of randomized controlled trials, albeit with reduced bias and the elimination of reverse causality (Fig. 1)11. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The principle of Mendelian randomization analysis is shown in the figure, where instrumental variables can represent exposure (druggable gene), are independent of confounding factors, and do not directly affect outcomes (Chronic kidney disease).Methods Study design In this MR analysis, we selected cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes as the exposure variable and employed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for CKD from the FinnGen database as the outcome variable. This approach was designed to elucidate the complex relationship between the expression of druggable genes and CKD. To identify the most suitable SNPs as instrumental variables, we conducted association analyses of the exposure factors and established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. A series of sensitivity analyses was implemented in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of the MR analysis. Furthermore, to elucidate the functional roles of the significant genes identified through MR analysis in terms of cellular composition, biological processes, and molecular functions, as well as to interpret the biological pathways they are involved in according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), we performed comprehensive functional annotations. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses on these significant genes, and provided detailed information regarding their chromosomal positions. Additionally, we performed colocalization analysis to evaluate whether cis-eQTL and CKD share the same causal variants. The overall design idea is detailed in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab The overall design of this study is shown in the figure.Data sources By comparing the sequences and structures of proteins present in human blood with those of currently identified drug target proteins, scientists identified several proteins that exhibit structural similarity to known drug targets and possess the potential to be modulated by drug-like small molecules. Consequently, scientists identified a specific group of genes for further investigation12. Finan identified 1,427 genes encoding drug targets that have been approved or are in the clinical phase, 682 genes encoding proteins that bind to known drug molecules or are similar to approved drug targets, and 2,370 genes that are members of a family of key druggable genes or encode proteins that are distantly similar to approved drug targets12. These 4,479 druggable genes have also been utilized by researchers to investigate potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis (Supplementary Material: Table S1)5. (Supplementary Material: Table S1). We queried the eQTLGen Consortium database for these 4,479 druggable genes and retrieved blood cis-eQTL data for 2,888 of them13. The eQTL data facilitated the identification of genetic variants associated with gene expression levels in blood samples, specifically those variants located within 1 Mb of the central location of each gene. FinnGen is a well-known and large database, and FinnGen provides genetic insights from a phenotypically well-defined and isolated population14. The CKD outcome data were derived from the FinnGen database, which collected information on 447,473 individuals, including 11,265 in the case group and 436,208 in the control group.Selection of instrumental variables Reliable and accurate instrumental variables are characterized by three distinctive features:1 a very strong association with the exposure2, no relationship with confounders other than the exposure, and3 the absence of horizontal pleiotropy. It is essential to note that horizontal pleiotropy should be entirely absent in MR analyses. To identify IVs meeting these criteria, we conducted a rigorous screening of each druggable gene. Initially, we performed association analyses to select SNPs from the cis-eQTL data, ensuring that only SNPs with P-values below the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 × 10− 8) were considered. Secondly, to mitigate the knock-on disequilibrium effects of these SNPs, we utilized the “TwoSampleMR” package in the R programming language to set the linkage disequilibrium (LD) threshold to R² < 0.1, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project (EUR population) with an aggregation distance of 10,000 kb15. In addition, we calculated the proportion of variance explained (R2) and the F statistic to quantify the strength of the tool with the following equations: R2 = 2 × MAF × (1 - MAF) × β2, and F = R2(n-k-1)/ k(1-R2), where “MAF” is the SNP used as the IV secondary allele frequency, “n” is the sample size, “k” is the number of IVs used16. To avoid weak IV bias, we selected SNPs with F > 10 as the IVs we analysed.Mendelian randomization analysis MR analyses were conducted using the “TwoSampleMR” package in R (version 4.4.1). For the MR analysis, the Wald ratio method was employed when a single SNP served as the IV. When the IV comprised two or more SNPs, we applied five different methods: inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. We used the IVW method as the primary analysis method because previous studies have shown that the IVW method is more conservative but more robust17. To account for multiple testing, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to identify significant MR analysis results. Additionally, to ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed several methods for sensitivity analyses. Potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q test18. Heterogeneity was considered absent if the p-value of the Cochrane Q test exceeded 0.05. Potential pleiotropy between exposure and outcome was examined using MR-Egger regression. Pleiotropy was considered absent if the p-value for the MR-Egger regression intercept was greater than 0.0518.Colocalization For druggable genes showing significant MR results, colocalization analysis was performed using the R package “coloc“19. The default a priori probabilities were P1 = 1.0 × 10− 4, P2 = 1.0 × 10− 4, and P12 = 1.0 × 10− 5, indicating that the SNPs were associated with the expression of the druggable genes, the outcome, or both, respectively. Posterior probabilities for the following five hypotheses were generated from the colocalization analysis: PPH 0, not associated with the expression or outcome of a druggable gene; PPH 1, associated with the expression of a druggable gene but not with the outcome; PPH 2, associated with the outcome but not with the expression of a druggable gene; PPH 3, associated with the expression and outcome of a druggable gene with a different causal variant; and PPH 4, association with expression of the druggable genes and outcome, with a shared causal variant. PPH 4 > 0.80 was considered strong.Gene function and pathway enrichment analysis GO is the world’s largest source of information on gene function. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is the basis for large-scale computational analyses20,21. KEGG is a database for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems from molecular-level information22–24. For biological process and pathway enrichment analyses, KEGG and GO analyses were performed using the R “clusterProfiler” software package. Finally, the R “circlize” package was used25 to display information on the location of these genes on the corresponding chromosomes.Results Twelve significant genes were identified by MR analysis of druggable genes We employed the IVW method as the primary analytical approach. Sixteen druggable genes exhibited a strong association with the development of CKD at a FDR of less than 0.05. These genes are PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, C4A, S100B, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, C4B, XYLT1, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8. To assess the pleiotropy of these 16 significant genes, we utilized MR-Egger regression. The intercept p-value for “S100B” was less than 0.05, indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Conversely, the intercept p-values for the remaining 15 significant genes were greater than 0.05, suggesting no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for these genes. The potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q-test. The results indicated significant heterogeneity for the IVs associated with “C4A,” “C4B,” and “XYLT1,” while no evidence of heterogeneity was found for the other significant genes. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we did not accept the presence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Consequently, we concluded that a causal association exists between 12 genes—PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8—and CKD (Fig. 3). It is worth mentioning that the MR-PRESSO test revealed no evidence of pleiotropy among these 12 significant genes. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab The 12 druggable genes are closely related to the risk of CKD after FDR correction. If OR is greater than 1, the gene is considered to be positively correlated with the occurrence of CKD, and if it is less than 1, it is considered to be negatively correlated. FDR is the corrected p-value, and FDR is greater than 0.05, which is considered statistically significant.Among these 12 significant genes, TUBB (OR: 1.2352; 95% CI: 1.1305–1.3496; FDR = 0.0085), PTPN22 (OR: 1.2897; 95% CI: 1.1893–1.3985; FDR < 0.001), MAP2K5 (OR: 1.1055; 95% CI: 1.0679–1.1445; FDR < 0.001), CHSY1 (OR: 1.1152; 95% CI: 1.0667–1.1659; FDR = 0.0044), DHFR (OR: 1.0390; 95% CI: 1.0214–1.0570; FDR = 0.0347), CXCR1 (OR: 1.1188; 95% CI: 1.0634–1.1771; FDR = 0.0430) and CD96 (OR: 1.0945; 95% CI: 1.0505–1.1404; FDR = 0.0475) expression were positively correlated with the risk of CKD. KSR1 (OR: 0.8809; 95% CI: 0.8441–0.9192; FDR < 0.001), CASP9 (OR: 0.8782; 95% CI: 0.8389–0.9195; FDR < 0.001), MYLK4 (OR: 0.9078; 95% CI: 0.8744–0.9423; FDR = 0.0011), GUCY1B2 (OR: 0.9068; 95% CI: 0.8679–0.9475; FDR = 0.0359) and VAMP8 (OR: 0.9215; 95% CI: 0.8879–0.9565; FDR = 0.0489) expression were negatively associated with CKD risk. (Information on the IVs used for these significant genes is detailed in Supplementary Material Table S2, and the results of MR analyses are detailed in Supplementary Material Table S3)Colocalization analysis of 12 significant genes Colocalization analysis can provide additional evidence for Mendelian randomization analysis, suggesting that associations between instrumental variables used for analysis and outcomes may be causal. Colocalization supports both an association between genetic variation and exposure and an association between exposure and outcome. When colocalization analyses show positive results, specific genetic variants share the same genetic location as signals associated with both exposure and outcome, this strengthens the belief that the association is due to genetic variants directly affecting exposure, and thus outcome. In addition, it reduces the likelihood of pleiotropy to some extent. In order to strengthen the evidence for an association between these key genes and CKD. For the 12 genes, we performed colocalization analyses to estimate the likelihood that the cis-eQTL and CKD results share a causal variant. The result of colocalization analysis indicated that CKD and TUBB genes might share a causal variant, with PP.H4 exceeding 0.80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Consequently, based on MR and colocalization analyses, we infer that TUBB is statistically likely to be a potential drug target for CKD treatment. (For details of the results of significant gene colocalization analysis, see Table S4 in the Supplementary Material)Demonstrate information about key genes on the corresponding chromosome The position of a gene on a chromosome may be related to its function, expression regulation, and interactions with other genes. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about their potential involvement in specific biological processes or pathways. Besides, many genetic disorders are associated with abnormalities in specific genes or gene clusters on chromosomes. Knowing the chromosomal location of these genes helps identify genetic variations related to diseases, providing important information for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Moreover, chromosomes are carriers of genetic information, and their structure, organization, and evolution are crucial for understanding the functional and evolutionary history of an organism’s genome. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about genome structure, chromosomal rearrangements, and evolutionary events. So, we show the information of the starting position of the remarkable genes on specific chromosomes. For example, the TUBB gene is located on chromosome 6 in the segment 30,687,978–30,693,203, and the PTPN22 gene is located on chromosome 1 in the segment 114,356,433–1,144,414,381 (Fig. 4). (Seeing Supplementary Material Table S1 for details). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab This figure shows the relationship between significant genes and chromosome positions. For example, TUBB is located on chromosome 6.Analysis of specific biological processes, functional classes and signalling pathways corresponding to key genes by GO/KEGG enrichment GO enrichment analysis showed that in the Biological Process module, these genes were mainly enriched on regulation of MAP kinase activity and regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity. In the Cellular Component module, these genes were mainly enriched in primary lysosome. In the molecular Function Module, these genes were mainly enriched on protein serine kinase activity (Fig. 5). KEGG pathway analyses showed that these genes were mainly enriched on Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway (Fig. 6). (For details of the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, please refer to Table S5 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Material.) Fig. 5. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of GO enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, in the Biological Process module, there are three significant genes enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity.Fig. 6. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of KEGG enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, there are two significant genes enriched in Gap junction.Notably, TUBB was pathway linked to Cellular community - eukaryotes, Infectious disease/bacterial, and Cellular Processes. In GO enrichment analysis, TUBB was associated with natural killer cell mediated immunity, leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, primary lysosome, azurophil granule, nuclear envelope lumen, spindle, intercellular bridge, GTPase activating protein binding, MHC class I protein binding, and MHC protein binding and other related.Discussion In this study, we found that the expression of 12 genes was closely related to CKD. For genes demonstrating significant associations in the MR analysis, we performed a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses and functional assessments. These included Cochrane’s Q-test, MR-Egger regression, colocalization analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the expression of the TUBB gene and CKD. MR analysis of druggable genes, along with colocalization analysis, has yielded compelling evidence suggesting that TUBB is a potential therapeutic target for CKD. The TUBB gene encodes β-tubulin, a structural component of microtubules that binds to α-tubulin to form a heterodimer, which subsequently contributes to microtubule assembly26. Microtubules (MTs) have been characterized as long, hollow polymers with a diameter of 25 nm and lengths ranging from less than 1 μm to over 100 μm. They were initially described as consisting of approximately 13 linear protofilaments, forming a polymer with a fast-growing positive end (exposed β-tubulin) and a slow-growing negative end (exposed α-tubulin)27. MTs are integral to the formation of cellular structures and the regulation of cellular functions, such as cell polarity and morphology, chromosome segregation during cell division, and the localization and transport of organelles28. Furthermore, MTs facilitate intracellular transport, assemble into larger structures with the aid of auxiliary proteins, and interact with various cell types to establish mature networks27. It has been proposed that microtubule-targeting compounds inhibit microtubule polymerization, thereby causing an imbalance in microtubule dynamics. This disruption results in spindle apparatus damage, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately, tumor cell death29. Consequently, compounds that target microtubules are capable of inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It is apparent that these compounds can interfere with a range of critical cellular processes30. Among the proteins constituting microtubules, β-tubulin is particularly significant. During microtubule polymerization, only the β-tubulin subunit is capable of hydrolyzing GTP following the incorporation of microtubule dimers31. This underscores the critical role of TUBB and its encoded β-tubulin proteins in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and human immunity. Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) developed based on β-tubulin proteins have a longstanding history and are considered among the earliest anti-cancer drugs30. For instance, compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine, and vindesine target the Vinca domain located at the inter-dimer interface between two longitudinally aligned tubulin dimers within the β-tubulin monomer32–34. Additionally, colchicine, benzimidazoles, and combretastatins interact with the colchicine binding sites situated in the deep pocket between αβ-tubulin dimers within β-tubulin monomers35. Furthermore, binding to the Taxane site of β-tubulin monomers in the inner lumen of MTs stabilizes the MT lattice. Consequently, MT-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epoxomicin have been developed36. Secondly, Maytansine and Spongistatin interact near the Vinca site on the exposed pocket of β-tubulin37,38. Similarly, the compounds Laulimalide and Peloruside target β-tubulin protein pockets oriented towards the exterior of microtubules (MTs)39,40. In 2021, the Gatorbulin site was identified, located within the α-tubulin subunit, between α- and β-tubulin, and proximal to the colchicine site. This site functions to form a wedge between two longitudinally aligned MT dimers at the MT terminus41. Recently, a novel compound named Cevipabulin has been reported to bind to this pocket42. The numerous sites of targeted drug development, whether currently known or unknown, associated with TUBB present substantial opportunities for TUBB to be considered a potential drug target in CKD. As discussed above, TUBB gene expression produces β - tubulin, which is involved in the composition of microtubules. Meanwhile, microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) interact with microtubules, such as participating in microtubule binding, regulating microtubule stability, polymerization, and depolymerization processes. They interact with each other and jointly participate in maintaining the cytoskeleton structure and cell morphology within the cell24. This is similar to our GO/KEGG enrichment analysis results, where in the Biological process module, these genes are mainly enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity. The relationship between GTPase activating protein (GAP) and microtubule proteins is close, and the microtubule network formed by the β - microtubule protein encoded by the TUBB gene can serve as a transport track and localization platform for signaling molecules28. This is similar to the results of our KEGG enrichment analysis, which mainly concentrates on the Gap junction. These β-tubulin protein-based microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) play a crucial role in tumor treatment by disrupting microtubule homeostasis within the spindle apparatus, thereby activating mitotic checkpoints. This disruption arrests cells at the mid-stage of mitosis, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis43,44. Additionally, these agents have demonstrated efficacy against parasites45. Recent research has indicated that TUBB, a microtubule protein, may play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying various renal diseases, including tubulointerstitial disease and renal fibrosis. For instance, Sang et al. demonstrated that the inhibition of microtubule dynamics hinders the repair of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and promotes renal fibrosis46. Additionally, Yang et al. identified β-tubulin as a serum marker for renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that this type of carcinoma is associated with elevated TUBB expression47. Although there is a paucity of comprehensive studies specifically addressing the relationship between TUBB and CKD, emerging research has increasingly concentrated on the interplay between MTs and their associated proteins in the context of CKD. A cross-sectional study has identified β-tubulin as a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment in CKD patients48. Additionally, recent findings indicate that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) mini-nuclear host gene 12 exacerbates inflammation and apoptosis while inhibiting autophagy in acute kidney injury by upregulating TUBB expression49. This finding aligns with the results of our analysis, which demonstrated a positive association between TUBB expression and CKD risk. Consequently, we propose that TUBB represents a potential therapeutic target for CKD, meriting further in-depth investigation into its underlying mechanisms. Apart from TUBB, several other potential targets were identified (Fig. 3). Although these additional significant genes were not corroborated by colocalization analysis, the important value of them cannot be entirely dismissed, and they continue to present a broad spectrum of possibilities for CKD drug development. Despite our rigorous analytical approach, which included the exclusion of results exhibiting heterogeneity and pleiotropy (including horizontal pleiotropy), our study has certain limitations. Firstly, our findings are based on statistical extrapolation, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where other confounding factors may interfere. Consequently, our results cannot entirely substitute for basic or clinical trials, nor can they guarantee the actual efficacy of the drug. Therefore, further basic and clinical research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms and effects of TUBB on CKD. Besides, the current analysis is ethnically constrained, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Importantly, our study offers significant insights and guidance for advancing research on identifying drug targets for CKD.Conclusion The causal relationship established through MR analysis and CKD suggests new avenues for targeted drug research. In summary, our MR analysis indicates that TUBB may serve as a potential target for reducing CKD risk.Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

    "title": "A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737020/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis. Keywords: co-immunoprecipitation, DLAT, ODP2, PDC-E2, megakaryocytes, NAP1L1, overexpression, platelets, protein interactions, sepsis",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [1] and lungs [2], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [3,4,5]. The development and maturation of MKs and the subsequent production of PLTs by MKs are tightly regulated and depend on external cues [6,7,8]. During the final stages of MK development, the cytoplasm is massively reorganized and long cytoplasmic extensions are formed, coined proplatelets [9]. Two cytoskeletal systems provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation: actin filaments and microtubules assembled from tubulin subunits [10,11]. More specifically, it was demonstrated that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. In this context, it is important to note that such processes are strictly dependent on sufficient availability of ATP as an energy source [12]. Once released into the circulation, PLTs impose as small, and anucleate cells. In the past, PLTs have traditionally been considered simple ‘sacs of glue’ with limited functionality beyond acute hemostasis due to the lack of a cell nucleus. However, in recent years, PLTs have been identified as dynamic effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum [6,7,8,13,14,15,16]. One mechanism explaining the multitude of functional responses is that MKs are equipped to sense external stimuli that trigger differential expression and packaging of mRNA and proteins into their progeny, causing distinct PLT functional alterations, especially in disease [6,7,8,17,18,19,20,21]. Hence, although PLTs are anucleate, we found that the PLTs’ array of mRNAs is dynamic and can undergo active re-programming [8,17,18,19]. Furthermore, intricate processes regulate RNA processing, expression, and translational events [22,23,24,25,26,27,28] in PLTs. In concert with maintaining nuclear RNA processing capabilities, numerous studies have shown that PLTs possess nuclear proteins, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) [29,30], and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) [28,31]. Sepsis is a common, and often morbid, syndrome which is characterized by systemic inflammation and dysregulated host immune responses triggered by invading pathogens or toxins (i.e., Toll-like receptor [TLR] agonists like LPS), frequently intensified by injurious agonists generated by the infected organism. The MK-PLT axis plays a major role in orchestrating sepsis-related thromboinflammatory and immunothrombotic events [7,32,33,34,35]. MKs were demonstrated to synergistically react to TLR 2/4 agonists in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling by increasing their proliferation, and thrombopoiesis [36]. However, this effect could only be observed in immature CD34+ cells, while MKs in the past 7 days of culture demonstrated slightly decreasing numbers when treated with LPS. Finally, PLT aggregation and the formation of heterotypic PLT-leukocyte aggregates in septic patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [37,38,39]. Nevertheless, the direct impact of PLTs in the pathobiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, several cell biology aspects, and mechanistic insight into PLT and MK functions during septic events are still obscure. The purification and functional characterization of a 53 kDa protein facilitating nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells was first described in 1984 [40]. The NAP-family, including nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), is a group of proteins with chaperone function, capable of binding histones and coordinating their assemblance into nucleosomal particles [41]. Several additional binding partners for NAP-family members were identified, including transcription factors, proteins regulating nuclear import (karyopherins), and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [41]). Specifically, NAP1L1 was described to promote proliferation of pluripotent stem cells [42] through cell cycle interference. Furthermore, NAP1L1, in concert with NAP1L4, can act as a histone chaperone [43], and serving as a co-factor for ubiquitination client selection [44]. Furthermore, numerous studies describe NAP1L1 as a prognostic marker in select cancer entities (i.e., colon cancer [45], hepatocellular carcinoma [46], ovarian cancer [47], and lung cancer [48]), and its involvement in a number of signaling pathways, which were demonstrated to result in tumor progression. NAP1L1 mRNA expression in human PLTs was previously described [49]; however, no function was assigned to this versatile nuclear protein in such anucleate cells, or its progenitors, MKs. Here, we demonstrate that MKs and human PLTs endogenously express differential NAP1L1 mRNA variants and protein isoforms. We identified PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex), as a protein interaction partner. In PLTs, septic conditions induced increased expression of NAP1L1 protein, and PDH complex activity. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs resulted in reduced proplatelet formation, and decreased PDH complex activity when treated with LPS, simulating a septic environment. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified NAP1L1 interaction partner in human PLTs and MKs. Furthermore, this newly described protein–protein interaction seems to influence PDH complex activity, with subsequent functional disturbances of these specialized cells.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents and Antibodies The following reagents and antibodies were used for microscopy, Western blot, and co-IP studies as described below: Paraformaldehyde (PFA 4% [2% final]), Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, W32464), Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate of phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A22287), 4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306), mouse anti-NAP1L1 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab58677), rabbit anti-NAP1L1 (abcam, ab33076), rabbit anti-Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component E2 (PDC-E2, ODP2; abcam, ab 66511), rabbit anti-beta tubulin (abcam, ab232361), mouse anti-tubulin (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA, T-5293), mouse anti-ACTB/actin HRP-conjugated (abcam, ab20272), and NAP1L1 blocking peptide (abcam, ab22418). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 and 546 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (G-21040, G-21234, S11223, A-11001, A-11008, A-21422, A-21428). 4.2. Septic Patients Patients were selected for meeting consensus criteria for sepsis [94], and enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). 4.3. PLT Isolation and Culture PLTs used for the described studies were freshly isolated. PLTs were leukocyte-reduced and isolated, as previously described to yield a highly purified population of cells with <1 leukocyte per 107 PLTs [23,24,66]. In addition, PLT activation during centrifugation steps was mitigated by the addition of 100 nM prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1) before each centrifugation step. Depleted PLTs were resuspended at 1 × 108/mL in a serum-free M199 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11150067), placed in round-bottom polypropylene tubes, and incubated, where indicated, in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO2 for different time points. In select studies, PLTs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulated with thrombin (factor IIa), as previously described [24]. 4.4. CD34+-Derived MKs CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and differentiated into proplatelet-producing MKs, as previously described [23,24,31]. 4.5. RNA Isolation MKs or PLTs were lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA isolation was performed, as previously described [23,24]. All RNA samples were DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1907) per manufacturer’s protocol. 4.6. Next Generation RNA-Sequencing For next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), 1 × 109 isolated PLTs were carefully lysed in TRIzol and DNase treated, as described above. Total RNA was isolated, as previously described [22,25,31,49,95]. An Agilent bio-analyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to quantify the amount and quality of the total RNA. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores were similar between all samples. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with TruSeq V2 with oligo-dT selection (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA, RS-122-2001). Reads were aligned (Novoalign) to the reference genome at the time of these studies (GRCh37/hg19) and a pseudo-transcriptome containing splice junctions. The Deseq2 analysis package was used to assign reads to composite transcripts (one per gene) and quantitate reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads/RPKMs. 4.7. PCR Studies To determine NAP1L1 mRNA expression pattern in human PLTs and CD34+-derived MKs, primers spanning exon 8–10 (248 bp product) of NAP1L1 (NAP1L1_1012_forward 5′-AGT GAA GTT CTC AGA TGC TGG-3′ and NAP1L1_1259_reverse 5′-CAC GTC CCT TGT GTT TCT GC-3′) and primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 (588 bp and 399 bp products) of NAP1L1 (NAP1L1_460_forward 5′-AGT CGC CGA TAT TTG GAG TTC T-3′ and NAP1L1_1047_reverse 5′-TCC TGA ACC ATA TCA CTG AGC A-3′) were used (in-house synthesis) and PCR was performed. Loading control primers detecting B2M mRNA were used on paralleling samples (B2M_34_forward 5′-AGC TGA CAG CAT TCG GGC-3′ and B2M_333_reverse GTG GGG GTG AAT TCA GTG TAG T-3′). Annealing temperatures were selected as follows: primers spanning exon 8–10 of NAP1L1, 60 °C; primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 of NAP1L1, 58 °C; primers detecting B2M, 57 °C. 4.8. Immunocytochemistry On day 13 of the CD34+- differentiation process, MKs were placed on fibrinogen-coated chamber slides to induce proplatelet formation, fixed (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AC327372500) for 5 min at room temperature (RT), and subsequently incubated with IgG, or an antibody against NAP1L1, and anti-b-tubulin antibody for co-staining purposes, overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or 546, followed by co-staining using DAPI for nuclear localization. In select studies (see Supplementary Figure S2), MKs were incubated with IgG or an antibody against NAP1L1, followed by co-staining for sialic acids/glycoproteins (in cell membranes/granular content) and the actin cytoskeleton using WGA or phalloidin, respectively. Freshly isolated PLTs were fixed in suspension using PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AC327372500) for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and subsequently layered onto VECTABONDTM (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, SP1800) coated coverslips using a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon Cytospin, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated with IgG (to control for specificity of signal) or an antibody against NAP1L1 overnight at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or 546. Sialic acids/glycoproteins (in cell membranes/granular content) were co-stained using WGA. 4.9. Microscopy and Image Analysis Fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution confocal reflection microscopy were performed using an Olympus IX81, FV300 (Olympus, Melville, NY) confocal-scanning microscope equipped with a 60×/1.42 NA oil objective for viewing PLTs. An Olympus FVS-PSU/IX2-UCB camera and scanning unit and Olympus Fluoview FV 300 image acquisition software version 5.0 were used for recording. In addition, an EVOS FL Auto Cell imaging system with an integrated dual camera system, system-specific software and equipped with a 609/1.42 NA oil objective was used. Monochrome 16-bit images were further analyzed, and changes were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS6, ImageJ (), and CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org (last accessed on 1 October 2022)) [96]. Analysis of images presented in Figure 5B was performed with a customized CellProfiler analysis set. In brief, raw images were automatically analyzed to minimize observer bias. The following software parameters were introduced: threshold method—otsu (this approach calculates the threshold separating three classes of pixels by minimizing the variance within each class); threshold correction factor—2.5 (a value > 1 makes the threshold more stringent, since the otsu method will give a slightly biased threshold if a larger percentage of the image is covered with positive signal). 4.10. Protein Expression Studies All samples were normalized for starting cell concentrations. PLTs were lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 or PDC-E2/ODP2 expression patterns. Subsequently, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32132). Linear range of detection was assured by using the saturation detection mode of the myECL Imager (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For select studies a peptide competition assay was performed. In brief, a PVDF membrane loaded equally was split in half, and probed using anti-NAP1L1 antibodies pre-incubated with or without specific NAP1L1 peptide fragment (blocking peptide; incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer (TBS, Tween, non-fat dry milk)). Specific protein expression was normalized using ACTB/actin or b-tubulin expression and quantified using ImageJ (). 4.11. Co-Immunoprecipitation Studies For all modified protein co-IP studies, the Universal Magnetic Co-IP Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 54002) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol; however, magnetic beads were replaced using protein G magnetic beads specifically suited for immunoprecipitation (Dynabeads; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10003D). In brief, 2 × 109 total PLTs, or MKs were first pelleted and washed in PBS supplemented with phosphatase and deacetylase inhibitors. Cells were then lysed in 300 µL of the provided whole-cell lysis buffer and an additional protease inhibitor cocktail supplied by the manufacturer. The magnetic beads used for the IP reaction were either incubated with the antibody of interest (anti-NAP1L1) or the respective IgG control for 30 min at RT. Co-IP was performed using the prepared beads, the supplied buffer and the PLT cell lysate from 0.6 × 109 PLTs or MKs with constant rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The IP complexes were isolated and cleaned by placing the samples on a magnetic stand and performing repeated washes with the provided wash-buffer. Finally, each bead pellet was resuspended in 20 µL of Laemmli-buffer and heated to 99 °C for 3 min before being separated using SDS-PAGE or Western blot techniques, as described above. For mass spectrometry purposes, gels were directly stained using standard MS-compatible silver staining. 4.12. Mass Spectrometry Protein bands of interest were manually picked using standard techniques to ensure minimal contamination with human skin particles. Excised protein bands were de-stained, extracted proteins were trypsin digested per established standard methods, and analyzed by an LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS coupled with a nano-acquity UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) mass spectrometer with electro-spray ionization at the University of Greifswald at the Institute of Functional Genome Research. Repeat MS/MS fragmentation was controlled by applying dynamic exclusion using one repeat count, a repeat duration of 30 s, an exclusion list size of 500, and an exclusion duration of 60 s. Peptides were identified using SEQUEST [97], and analyzed using Scaffold (v.27 r.11, Proteome Software, Portland OR, USA) and the peptide/protein prophet algorithm [98], which was linked to the Uni-PROT/SWISS-PROT (human_v2014_02) data base, resulting in total spectrum counts per identified protein. Analysis settings included a peptide mass tolerance of 5 ppm, fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da, monoisotopic masses and trypsin cleavage (maximum two missed cleavages). Protein identifications were accepted when p < 0.05 after adjustment using the Scaffold mass correction, resulting in a false discovery rate of <1%. 4.13. PDH Activity Assay All samples prepared and used for the performance of the PDH activity assay were normalized by cell number. The assay was conducted following the manufacturer’s protocol (abcam, ab109882). In brief, 50 µL of each sample was used and an equal volume of blocking fluid was added to a 96-well plate. The dipstick was dipped into the well and the sample allowed to wick onto the dipstick for 60 min. The dipstick was washed, and an activity buffer was added for 20 min. Since the activity reaction is an endpoint reaction, each dipstick was exposed for precisely monitored equal exposure times. The reaction was stopped using ddH2O. The results were documented using imaging scan techniques, and the signal was quantified using ImageJ (). 4.14. NAP1L1 In Vitro Transcription NAP1L1 was in vitro transcribed using a commercially available NAP1L1 expression plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD, USA, RC201851) containing a T7 promotor for seamless in vitro transcription reactions. The linearized plasmid template, using the Pme I restriction site, was introduced into the in vitro transcription reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1345). The selected in vitro transcription kit, mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 ULTRA Transcription Kit, was optimized to synthesize large amounts of efficiently and correctly capped mRNA, including a final poly(A) tailing step. The final mRNA product was subsequently isolated and purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1908), and stored at −80 °C until used for transfection reactions. 4.15. NAP1L1 Transfection and Overexpression CD34+-derived MKs were transfected on day 12 of the culture and were placed on immobilized fibrinogen on day 14 to induce proplatelet formation. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ MessengerMAX™ Transfection Reagent per the manufacturer’s standard protocol. In brief, MKs on day 12 of the culture and differentiation course were used for the experiment. MesengerMAX reagent was diluted in Opti-MEM Medium (1:16.6). Next, mRNA master mixes were prepared by adding 1 µg of in vitro transcribed capped and poly(A)-tailed NAP1L1 mRNA, or its vehicle to 25 µL Opti-MEM Medium. The diluted mRNA was subsequently added to the dilute MessengerMAX, as prepared above, and incubated for 5 min. at room temperature. Transfection mixes were added to cells and incubated over night at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated overnight with LPS 100 ng/mL or its vehicle, lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 over-expression patterns. 4.16. Proplatelet Formation Assay On day 13, the proplatelet forming (PPF) MK, defined as displaying at least one filamentous pseudopod, were scored by microscopy blinded as to experimental group, as previously described [17]. The percentage of PPF MK was calculated as the number of PPF MK compared to the total number of round cultured cells analyzed. An average of 200 cells were counted per condition. 4.17. Statistical Analyses The mean ± SEM was determined for each variable. Student t-tests or ANOVA (where multiple groups were compared) was used to identify differences among two or multiple experimental groups, respectively (GraphPad Prism v9.1.0). If significant differences were found, Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used as recommended to determine the location of the difference (applicable for ANOVA).

CD34+-Derived MKs and Freshly Isolated Human PLTs Express NAP1L1 We initially sought to determine RNA expression patterns of NAP1L1 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived MKs and freshly isolated human PLTs. Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MKs and human PLTs express messenger RNA (mRNA) for NAP1L1 (Figure 1A,B). Consistent with its expression demonstrated via RNA-seq, NAP1L1 mRNA was also detected in MKs using PCR techniques (Figure 1C). NAP1L1 was consistently expressed over the entire time course of MK culture and differentiation. Furthermore, NAP1L1 was readily detectable in RNA samples isolated from human PLTs (Figure 1D). Of note, all PLT samples used for these studies were DNase treated to exclude any DNA contaminants from nucleated cells. Figure 1. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express mRNA for NAP1L1. RNA-seq snapshots taken from the Integrated Genome Browser of the NAP1L1 transcript in CD34+-derived MKs (A) and human PLTs (B) (representative for n = 3). The height on the y-axis represents the relative accumulated number of reads spanning a particular sequence. The average of the read depths across all genomic coordinates within a transcript correlate to abundance of RNA expression. NAP1L1 transcript regions are represented below the plots by thick (exon) and thin (intron) lines. (C) MKs at culture days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 were examined for NAP1L1 expression by PCR. NT represents the reverse transcription (RT) reaction using no template, NE represents the RT reaction using no enzyme. Both controls were performed to control for contaminating nuclear DNA. Bottom, B2M as a loading control. This figure is representative of 5 independent experiments. (D) RNA from freshly isolated PLTs at baseline was isolated and NAP1L1 mRNA expression was evaluated by PCR. This figure is representative of 3 independent experiments. The -PCR lane shows the negative control for the PCR reaction, lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane.Since multiple alternative transcripts are described to exist for NAP1L1, we next performed PCR experiments using a primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7, enabling us to detect a potential alternative NAP1L1 transcript variant 5, which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 (Figure 2A). MKs as well as PLT samples demonstrated the presence of PCR products indicative of NAP1L1 transcript variant 1 (Figure 2B,C), PCR product band indicated at ~600 bp) and transcript variant 5 (Figure 2B,C, PCR product band indicated at ~400 bp). These findings were verified by Sanger sequencing for excised PCR products, demonstrating full length transcript as well as a transcript devoid of exon 3 and 4 (data not shown). In addition, we were able to detect NAP1L1 transcript variants at all stages of MK differentiation (Figure 2B). Furthermore, allowing the incubation of PLTs overnight (Figure 2C), or the placement of PLTs on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulating the cells using thrombin (Supplementary Figure S1) did not alter the expression pattern of alternative transcripts; therefore, no loading control was included. Figure 2. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express alternative NAP1L1 transcript variants. (A) Schematic representation of the organization of exons in NAP1L1 transcript variant 1 (top), and transcript variant 5 (bottom) missing exons 3 and 4.

Bottom, B2M as a loading control. This figure is representative of 5 independent experiments. (C) RNA from freshly isolated PLTs at baseline (BL) and after culture overnight (ON) was isolated and NAP1L1 mRNA expression was evaluated by PCR. This figure is representative of 10 independent experiments. The -PCR lane shows the negative control for the PCR reaction, lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. Relevant PCR products are indicated by yellow arrows.Consistent with our findings by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Figure 1 and Figure 2, and data not shown), we found that NAP1L1 protein is endogenously and robustly expressed in situ in the cytoplasm and proplatelet extensions of MKs (Figure 3A). It is interesting to note that NAP1L1 protein localization in MKs is less pronounced in cell nuclei; however, it demonstrates some peri-nuclear enhancement. Furthermore, cells undergoing anaphase showed reduced NAP1L1 association with condensed chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S2). While nucleosome assembly proteins were initially identified as being histone chaperones and chromatin-assembly factors, additional functions were assigned including tissue-specific transcription regulation, apoptosis, histone shuttling, cell-cycle regulation, and additional chaperone functions beyond histone binding [41]. Our microscopic findings in MKs could potentially point towards such extra nuclear functions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express NAP1L1 protein. (A) CD34+-derived MKs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen to induce proplatelet formation, fixed, and then incubated with an antibody against NAP1L1 (yellow, top right panel) or an IgG control, followed by co-staining for b-tubulin (magenta) and nuclei (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI, blue), as shown in the bottom panels. Scale bars = 20 µm. This figure is representative of n = 7 independent experiments. (B) NAP1L1 protein expression (green) in human PLTs. PLTs incubated with an IgG control antibody are shown (left, IgG). The bottom panels show the corresponding transmission images overlayed with the co-staining with WGA (red). Scale bars = 10 µm. This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Immunoblot analysis of MK lysates (day 13 of culture) using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. NAP1L1 isoforms are highlighted by a red box. (D) Immunoblot analysis of PLT lysates using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis; however, the samples were split and processed in parallel in the absence (left) or presence (right) of an NAP1L1-quenching peptide. The presence of the blocking peptide prevents the detection of NAP1L1 with the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, demonstrating specificity for the three main NAP1L1 protein isoforms. Lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. (C,D), representative of 3 and 8 independent experiments, respectively.In unstimulated human PLTs, NAP1L1 protein concentrated and accumulated peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern (Figure 3B). Immunoblotting also confirmed our microscopic findings of NAP1L1 protein being present in MKs (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, Western blotting revealed three major protein bands at 60, 53 and 37 kDa, while the predicted size for NAP1L1 protein (expected isoform 1) is 43–53 kDa. Therefore, we sought to examine the specificity of the used anti-NAP1L1 antibody. A peptide competition assay (quench experiment) using the immunogenic peptide (Figure 3D, right) showed that all three detected protein bands specifically represent NAP1L1 isoforms or potentially post-translational modified NAP1L1 in human PLT samples (Figure 3D, left). 2.2. NAP1L1 Directly Interacts with the Dihydrolipopolylysine-Residue Acetyltransferase Component of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC-E2, ODP2) Because of its multitude of functions described in the literature, and its widely unknown roles in MK and PLT cell biology, we next wanted to identify NAP1L1 protein binding partners in human PLTs. To identify such interaction partners, we used carefully controlled co-IP experiments followed by mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses of a selected band. We identified a highly specific protein, which was only present in the specific anti-NAP1L1 pull-down (Figure 4A, second lane from left); however, was absent in the isotype-specific IgG control (Figure 4A, third lane from left). Furthermore, we excluded non-specific binding to the protein G magnetic beads by including a control condition using those beads only (Figure 4A, right lane). Figure 4. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 directly interacts with PDC-E2. (A) Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel were stained for total protein using standard MS-compatible silver staining. The left lane shows proteins isolated after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The middle lane shows proteins isolated after co-IP with non-immunogenic, control IgG. The right lane shows proteins isolated after the use of protein-G beads only. Red box marks selected protein band subsequently used in MS analysis. This figure is representative of n = 5 independent experiments. (B) Bar graph showing the total spectrum count per protein. Black bars show counts for MS performed after control IgG experiment; non-filled bars demonstrated spectrum counts for proteins identified after co-IP using anti-NAP1L1. Total spectrum counts for PDC-E2 are indicated by red asterisk. (C) Bar graph showing the normalized spectrum count (normalized to all total spectrum counts) for PDC-E2. Black bar represents counts for MS performed after control IgG experiment; non-filled bar show spectrum counts for PDC-E2 identified after co-IP using anti-NAP1L1. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0271. (D) A corresponding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel was analyzed using immunoblotting technique. Co-IP proteins were probed using an anti-PDC-E2 antibody. The left lane shows proteins isolated after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The middle lane shows proteins isolated after co-IP with non-immunogenic, control IgG. The right lane shows proteins isolated after the use of protein-G beads only. Red box and yellow arrow mark PDC-E2 protein detected as being co-IP’ed using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, indicating protein–protein interaction. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments.Besides contaminating human cytokeratin, which was most likely introduced during protein processing, we found the highest total spectrum count being present for ODP2_HUMAN (Figure 4B), the human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component (PDC-E2). The highly specific nature of this identified NAP1L1 binding partner was further underscored by its significantly increased normalized spectrum count for peptide sequences, when compared to samples co-IPed using IgG (Figure 4C). Consistent with its expression pattern at the peptide level, immunoblotting demonstrated robust and specifically detectable NAP1L1—PDC-E2 protein interaction in human PLTs (Figure 4D) using Western blot approaches. PDC-E2—human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase is the E2 component of the multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). In nucleated cells, DLAT, the gene encoding PDC-E2, is part of the nuclear DNA, and upon translation, the protein needs to be transported to the inner mitochondria membrane. Here, the enzyme transfers acetyl groups to coenzyme A. In addition, PDC can also be present in the nucleus catalyzing histone acetylation [50,51]. In turn, PDC-E2 is also the key antigen in primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic liver disease with autoimmune component targeting intrahepatic bile duct lining cells [52,53]. 2.3. NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 Show Dynamic Expression Changes When PLTs Are Exposed to Septic Conditions NAP1L1 was previously assigned chaperone and transport functions, involving histone complexes [54,55], diacylglycerol kinase ζ [56], mtHsp70 [57]. Here, we add an additional interaction partner, PDC-E2, to the evolving functional repertoire of NAP1L1. With PDC-E2 being an integral part of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, we started exploring functional consequences of the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction. Several studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gets dysregulated due to septic host environment [58,59]. Although anucleate, emerging data demonstrates that the human PLT transcriptome is not static. Rather, the PLT transcriptome is dynamic and markedly altered during systemic inflammatory diseases [6,7,22,26]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 protein expression levels in human PLTs isolated from septic patients. To determine whether transcripts coding for NAP1L1 were altered in PLTs during sepsis, we used RNA-seq on highly purified PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy donors. This study was performed as a sub-analysis of a dataset previously published by our group [8]. Figure 5A demonstrates the significant increase in mRNA coding for NAP1L1 in PLTs isolated from septic patients. Figure 5. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 shows dynamic protein expression changes when PLTs are exposed to septic conditions. PLTs were isolated from healthy individuals or septic patients within 48 h of ICU admission. (A) Total RNA was isolated and next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). Data show the RPKM expression for NAP1L1 for healthy (grey), and septic (non-filled) samples. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0001. (B) PLTs were fixed in suspension immediately after isolation. Immunofluorescence staining with an anti-NAP1L1 (green) antibody demonstrates robust expression of NAP1L1 protein in PLTs from septic patients and healthy PLTs (scale bars: 10 µm). Cells were co-stained using WGA (red). This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Micrographs were analyzed using CellProfiler. The bar graph displays the mean intensity over all stained cells for NAP1L1, normalized to IgG. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0505. (D) PLTs from healthy individuals and septic patients were isolated. NAP1L1 protein expression levels were detected by Western blot. Positions of NAP1L1 isoforms are marked. Corresponding tubulin is shown at the bottom and was used for normalization of data presented in bar graph shown in (E) below. This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. Analyzed using Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.0368.Having detected significantly increased NAP1L1 transcript levels in PLTs from septic patients, we hypothesized that NAP1L1 protein expression would similarly be altered during sepsis. We initially used immunofluorescence staining (ICC) to examine NAP1L1 protein expression and localization in PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy control donors. NAP1L1 staining was localized peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern (Figure 5B). In septic PLTs, using automated image analysis, we detected an increased mean fluorescent intensity for NAP1L1 (Figure 5C), which translated into a significant fold-increase of staining intensity (data not shown). To further test the above hypothesis, we used Western blot analysis to examine total PLT NAP1L1 protein expression. Figure 5D,E demonstrate significantly increased NAP1L1 protein expression in PLTs from septic patients. In contrast to the increased NAP1L1 expression, Western blot analysis for PDC-E2 showed significantly decreased total protein expression in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy controls (Figure 6A,B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab PDC-E2 protein levels and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity is increased in PLTs during sepsis. PLTs from healthy individuals and septic patients were isolated. (A) PDC-E2 protein expression levels were detected by Western blot. Position of PDC-E2 is marked. Corresponding actin (ACTB) is shown at the bottom and was used for the normalization of data presented in the bar graph shown in (B) below. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0360. (C) Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity assay was performed on PLTs isolated from septic (n = 13) and healthy (n = 11) individuals. Bar graph depicts mean optical signal ± SEM. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0278. 2.4. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Activity Is Increased in PLTs during Sepsis The immunometabolism during sepsis is characterized by a switch from a high-energy infection resistance mode to a low-energy conservation tolerance mode within 4–8 h after sepsis dissemination [58]. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex acts as an energy homeostat, and its deactivation creates an energy supply chain shortage during sepsis. Here, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity was significantly increased in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy donor PLTs (Figure 6C), which could indicate an early stage in the septic continuum. 2.5. NAP1L1 Overexpression in MKs Induced Reduced Proplatelet Formation (PPF) To further establish potential functional consequences of the newly described NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction, we utilized an established CD34+-derived human MK cell culture model [23,24,31,60]. MKs are PLT precursor cells, contain many of the same proteins and pathways as PLTs, and are often used as a relevant model system to study PLT responses [8,60,61]. While PLTs are only extremely difficult or not at all accessible to modifications of their transcriptome, MKs have been genetically modified using several different techniques [62,63]. Here, we used “liposome-based transfection” utilizing the transfer of in vitro transcribed, capped, and poly(A) tailed NAP1L1 mRNA into MKs (Figure 7A), to induce transient overexpression of NAP1L1. Figure 7B demonstrates the successful overexpression of NAP1L1 protein in MKs. In contrast to PLTs isolated from septic patients, the exposure of human MKs to an agonist commonly generated during sepsis (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) did result in a slight decrease of the endogenous NAP1L1 protein level, independent of the transfection. In addition, treatment of transfected cells with LPS did also not lead to NAP1L1 protein levels above the non-LPS but transfected condition. We next analyzed proplatelet formation (PPF), an energy intensive hallmark functional determinate of MKs in NAP1L1 transfected cell cultures. We were able to show that NAP1L1 protein overexpression in non-treated cells, and even more pronounced in with LPS-treated cells, significantly decreased PPF (Figure 7C,D). Additional co-IP experiments using MKs demonstrated increased NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction when cells were exposed to LPS (Supplementary Figure S3A). Furthermore, consistent with the PPF data indicating decreased functional capacity of MKs under septic conditions, LPS treatment decreased the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in our culture model (Supplementary Figure S3B). Figure 7. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 overexpression in MKs results in decreased (PPF). (A) Schematic of protocol for NAP1L1 overexpression in MKs.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion The MK-PLT axis is increasingly recognized as being more intricate and sophisticated in cellular responsibilities and abilities than historically expected. MKs are not only producing PLTs in the bone marrow through thrombopoiesis but are also intimately involved in setting up the PLT immune potential. MKs invest PLTs with the molecular composition to take center stage as responders and immune sentinels in the initiation and propagation of coordinated host immune responses [64]. Furthermore, while PLTs are anucleate, it has been demonstrated that they contain a complex transcriptome [20,49] and regulatory pathways, including cytoplasmic splicing, controlling important biologic tasks [22,23,24,26,27,28,60,65,66,67]. In concert with these signal-dependent pathways, it was demonstrated that PLTs possess nuclear proteins. In a comprehensive PLT proteome analysis, 13% of all identified proteins were mapped to a nuclear location [68]. PLTs utilize such proteins in established functions, as well as assigning alternative roles. Amongst other nuclear proteins, MKs distribute a functional spliceosome to PLTs [23,24]. In addition, nuclear receptors, including the receptors for sex steroids, glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)s, and retinoid X receptors (RXR)s were detected in PLTs, reported to bind their respective ligands, which induce PLT aggregation and activation (reviewed in [69]). Unexpectedly, RAR was also demonstrated to be utilized by PLTs as a translational regulator [28]. RAR is additionally employed in non-genomic activities by controlling actin cytoskeletal events [31]. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data exploring and finally comparing the functional capacities of nuclear proteins in PLTs with their counterparts residing in MKs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that NAP1L1 mRNA is expressed in PLTs demonstrating potential transcript variants previously not detected in PLTs (Figure 1 and Figure 2, and Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, we identify a protein interaction partner, PDC-E2, hitherto not characterized as being part of the NAP1L1 protein network (Figure 4). Using septic PLTs, we were able to also demonstrate a dynamic protein expression pattern of NAP1L1 and its interaction partner PDC-E2, potentially resulting in altered pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity (Figure 5 and Figure 6). In addition, using human MK cells, we were able to show that overexpression of NAP1L1 results in diminished proplatelet formation, and decreased PDC-E2-dependent PDH activity (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S3). Our analyses of MKs and PLTs are also the first to examine NAP1L1 transcript levels and protein expression pattern. While NAP1L1 mRNA was previously detected in human PLTs [49,70], no in-depth analysis of potential transcript variants, changes in transcript levels, or specific protein expression or localization analysis was performed. Consistent with previous RNA sequencing results, we observed expression of NAP1L1 mRNA using RNA sequencing techniques as well as confirmatory PCR approaches for PLT as well as MK samples, harvested throughout the MK culture period (Figure 1). Next, we designed a PCR primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7. This enabled us to detect alternative transcript processing in MKs and PLTs resulting in NAP1L1 transcript variant 5 (NM_001330232.2), which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 (Figure 2). This suggests that alternative splicing of NAP1L1 occurs in MKs, and that PLTs get invested with such alternative transcripts by MKs. It is interesting to note that the transcript variant ratios did not change due to activation of PLTs using immobilized fibrinogen and thrombin (Supplementary Figure S1), indicating that the alternative splicing process does not occur in the PLT cell bodies. NAP1L1 transcript variant 5 is coding for the putative NAP1L1 isoform 3 (NP_001317161.1), which misses the N-terminal domain I. Domain I is mainly responsible for dimerization of NAP1L1 and mediating histone interaction [54,55,71]. The presence of transcript variant 5, coding for a protein with a deleted functional domain, could be indicative of alternative protein functions of NAP1L1, besides the nucleosome assembly task in MKs and human PLTs. Taken together, these initial findings focused on NAP1L1 transcripts demonstrated the presence of at least two NAP1L1 transcript variants (1 and 5) and raised the question regarding whether NAP1L1 protein isoforms are located in MK and PLT cell bodies. Using initial microscopy studies, we were able to demonstrate NAP1L1 protein in MKs, their proplatelet extensions (Figure 3A), as well as in PLT cell bodies in a peri-granular pattern. While not performing detailed co-localization studies, the images from PLT studies support the finding that NAP1L1 protein does most likely not reside within the PLT granular compartment (Figure 3B). Interestingly, NAP1L1 protein signals demonstrate minimal co-localization with nuclear/DNA co-staining signals when examining dividing MK-progenitors (Supplementary Figure S2). Despite the known NAP-family members functions in DNA replication and cell proliferation [72], and the previously described changing intracellular localization [41], this could furthermore point towards an alternative cellular function assigned to NAP1L1 in the MK-PLT axis. To confirm our microscopy data, we next examine NAP1L1 protein expression using Western blot analysis (Figure 3C,D). Our studies specifically demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of at least three different NAP1L1 isoforms in MKs and PLTs. This finding is consistent with the initial description of NAP1L1 and subsequent publications, which showed Western blot results indicating the existence of multiple NAP1L1 protein isoforms [40,43,73]. To exclude cross-reactivity of the detection antibody, which could lead to false positive results, we performed peptide competition assays clearly demonstrating the specificity of our findings. The difference between observed and predicted molecular weight for NAP1L1 proteins, shown in our study, can be explained by potential post-translational modifications. NAP1L1, as part of the human NAP1L-family members, is known to contain C-terminal glutamylation sites, creating a reversible acidic C-terminal moiety, with the potential of switching between different protein functions [55,74,75], but also resulting in changed migration during SDS-PAGE. This potential mechanism of post-translational protein and also functional modification was highlighted in a recent publication [76]. Ye and colleagues demonstrated that MKs contain the enzymatic machinery necessary for performing and reversing polyglutamylations, namely tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family (TTLL) members TTLL4 and TTLL6, and cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) 6. Therefore, differential protein isoform as well as specific post-translational modifications could be displayed by the detected NAP1L1 signals. To explore additional NAP1L1 functions, besides the traditionally assigned roles, we wanted to further explore if new protein partners interacting with NAP1L1 could be identified in MKs and PLTs. Using co-IP techniques, we were able to reproduce a highly specific protein band, which could be identified and verified as PDC-E2, the protein product of DLAT (Figure 4). PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Recent studies indicated that PDC is also present in the nucleus and processes/catalyzes histone acetylation [51,77], and its subunit PDC-E2 can act as a nuclear transcriptional regulator [78]. PDC-E2, also called dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, is the acceptor molecule for acetyl groups formed by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and transfers them to coenzyme A. Of note, in addition to its essential role in cellular metabolism, PDC-E2 is the key autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) [53]. Like many mitochondrial proteins, PDC-E2 is encoded by the nuclear genome and translated in the cytoplasm with an amino-terminal targeting sequence [79,80]. A direct interaction of NAP-family members with mitochondrial proteins is not unprecedented. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, Stelzl and colleagues created extensive protein–protein interaction maps, demonstrating that NAP1L1 interacted with dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), a component of the mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex [81]. Furthermore, Okada et al. [56] demonstrated that NAP1L1 interacted with diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which prohibited its nuclear import through blocking import carrier protein interaction. Therefore, in MKs, one might speculate if the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction could serve a similar import–export control pathway. Because of its clinical relevance, we decided to study NAP1L1 expression and potential function in a common, morbid, and often fatal systemic inflammatory disease—sepsis. We detected an increase in NAP1L1 transcript in human PLTs, a finding which was paralleled by the protein expression data shown via immune detection of NAP1L1 (Figure 5). These findings pointed towards a dynamic regulation of NAP1L1 in septic PLTs, a clinical situation NAP1L1 was never studied under. Next, we examined PDC-E2 protein expression pattern in septic PLTs (Figure 6). PDC-E2 protein expression levels decreased in septic PLTs. However, PDH complex activity increased 13-fold over the metabolic activity measured in PLTs isolated from healthy individuals. This finding could be met with surprise since published studies indicate that the PDH complex is inhibited during sepsis, resulting in a switch from mitochondrial aerobic oxidation to cytoplasmic anaerobic glycolysis, a process known to contribute to the formation of lactic acid and intracellular acidosis, which can lead to intracellular Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial membrane damage [58,82,83]. Nevertheless, contrasting the general PDC-dependent metabolic reprogramming response in sepsis [58,84,85], several studies demonstrated that mitochondrial oxygen consumption in PLTs is increased in septic patients, and closely related to their survival rate [86,87,88]. Therefore, based on our observations, we speculate that due to its chaperone and potential shuttling function, NAP1L1 protein in septic PLTs could help stabilize the conformation of PDC-E2 molecules, and also mediate the known one-way transport [89] into the mitochondrial compartment. To confirm these results, the next step would be to genetically modify the target cells to demonstrate functional coherence. However, it is difficult to produce transfected and genetically modified uniform, high-quality human PLTs. Therefore, to further decipher the functional and mechanistic impact of NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction on the MK-PLT axis, we utilized a well-established PLT-surrogate MK culture model, as previously used by our laboratory [7,23,24,31]. To mimic increased NAP1L1 protein levels in septic PLTs, we used “liposome-based transfection” techniques (Figure 7A). Using this approach, NAP1L1 could be robustly overexpressed in the human MK culture system (Figure 7B). Transfected or vehicle-treated MKs were subsequently incubated with LPS, one of the major determinants in Gram-negative sepsis [90]. It is important to note that LPS uses a well-established signaling pathway through TLR4, which is expressed by CD34+-derived MKs [36]. In contrast to our septic PLT experiments, we observed that LPS treatment alone resulted in slightly decreased NAP1L1 expression levels. Performing a proplatelet formation (PPF) assay [17], a standard read-out for MK function, we detected decreased PPF when NAP1L1 was overexpressed in MKs. In addition, it appeared that NAP1L1 protein overexpression and simulated septic conditions using LPS treatment, synergistically reduced PPF (Figure 7C,D). During their final stages, MKs produce PLTs by extending long cytoplasmic protrusions, designated proplatelets [9], into sinusoidal blood vessels, a process coined PPF. While two independent, but interrelated cytoskeletal systems, actin filaments and tubulin subunits, provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation [10], it was elegantly shown that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. The rolling up of microtubules as they drive apart and extend the proplatelet is likely to be involved in forming the coils found in the proplatelet tips and the mature PLTs, called marginal band. The production of force with its synchronized cycles of microtubule binding and release, is energy consuming, using the hydrolysis of ATP [12]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction and PDH complex activity in MKs under simulated septic conditions, which might explain the decreased PPF. LPS-treated MKs demonstrated increased interactions between NAP1L1 and PDC-E2, and a significantly decreased PDH complex activity (Supplementary Figure S3). These findings contrast our experimental results from septic PLTs. Nevertheless, opposite NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction levels, and PDH complex activity could potentially be explained by PLTs being anucleate, and therefore potentially using NAP1L1 protein in a different context than nucleated MKs. In PLTs, it seems more likely that NAP1L1 function could be defined and garnered towards chaperoning PDC-E2. Contrastingly, in MKs, NAP1L1 could help in the compartmentalization of PDC-E2, and therefore prohibiting the protein from entering its functional complex PDC, as it was shown for DGKζ [56]. In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is closely related with clinical outcome. In this context, our MK data also complements previous reports demonstrating that one potential mechanism for low PLT counts in severely ill patients with advanced thrombocytopenia could be diminished thrombopoiesis [91,92]. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate about potential upstream signaling mechanisms triggering, and potentially enabling the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction. In 1999, Cataldo and colleagues reported that Mpl (thrombopoietin, TPO), ligand of the Mpl-c receptor, regulates NAP1 family member expression in a rat bone marrow model [93]. The authors were able to demonstrate that these NAP-related effects were limited to Mpl and could not be reproduced by other bone marrow growth factors (i.e., granulocate colony stimulating factor), which led to the conclusion of a cytokine specific effect. These results can be interpreted as a TPO-specific signaling pathway integrating sensing of PLT numbers, stimulation of progenitor cells by Mpl, and subsequent modulation of protein interactions. The involvement of the Mpl (TPO) signaling pathway in the newly discovered NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction will therefore be a focus of future studies. The presented study was data driven and performed under best research practice. Nevertheless, there are some limitations to this study. Since the generation of the presented data, CRISPR-Cas9 technique has been developed for rapid genetic manipulation of MKs [62]. For future studies we would propose to use such an approach for further dissecting the mechanistic function of PDC-E2 in MKs in greater detail. We appreciate the descriptive character of our study; however, this is the first report of NAP1L1 interacting specifically with a previously unrecognized partner protein. Therefore, we recognize that our findings should be extended in future studies, potentially complemented by in vivo work using relevant mouse models. In conclusion, our data demonstrate NAP1L1 expression in human PLTs and MKs. This is the first time that expression of different NAP1L1 transcript variants, and protein isoform was confirmed in such cells. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that NAP1L1 interacts with PDC-E2, a subunit of the PDH complex. The PDH complex acts as an energy homeostat bridging glycolysis to energy production, and its function gets modulated during sepsis, carbohydrate metabolism away from mitochondrial oxidation. Our data shed new light on such processes taking place in PLTs and MKs during sepsis. At the moment, however, it remains undetermined how NAP1L1 functions are coordinated when comparing nucleated versus anucleate state. Nevertheless, our results support the conclusion of differential functions of NAP1L1 in MKs and PLTs during systemic inflammation and open a new avenue of sepsis research focused on the MK-PLT axis.",

Copyright notice ID: 9737020 PMID: 36499021 Abstract Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis. Keywords: co-immunoprecipitation, DLAT, ODP2, PDC-E2, megakaryocytes, NAP1L1, overexpression, platelets, protein interactions, sepsis1. Introduction Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [1] and lungs [2], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [3,4,5]. The development and maturation of MKs and the subsequent production of PLTs by MKs are tightly regulated and depend on external cues [6,7,8]. During the final stages of MK development, the cytoplasm is massively reorganized and long cytoplasmic extensions are formed, coined proplatelets [9]. Two cytoskeletal systems provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation: actin filaments and microtubules assembled from tubulin subunits [10,11]. More specifically, it was demonstrated that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. In this context, it is important to note that such processes are strictly dependent on sufficient availability of ATP as an energy source [12]. Once released into the circulation, PLTs impose as small, and anucleate cells. In the past, PLTs have traditionally been considered simple ‘sacs of glue’ with limited functionality beyond acute hemostasis due to the lack of a cell nucleus. However, in recent years, PLTs have been identified as dynamic effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum [6,7,8,13,14,15,16]. One mechanism explaining the multitude of functional responses is that MKs are equipped to sense external stimuli that trigger differential expression and packaging of mRNA and proteins into their progeny, causing distinct PLT functional alterations, especially in disease [6,7,8,17,18,19,20,21]. Hence, although PLTs are anucleate, we found that the PLTs’ array of mRNAs is dynamic and can undergo active re-programming [8,17,18,19]. Furthermore, intricate processes regulate RNA processing, expression, and translational events [22,23,24,25,26,27,28] in PLTs. In concert with maintaining nuclear RNA processing capabilities, numerous studies have shown that PLTs possess nuclear proteins, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) [29,30], and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) [28,31]. Sepsis is a common, and often morbid, syndrome which is characterized by systemic inflammation and dysregulated host immune responses triggered by invading pathogens or toxins (i.e., Toll-like receptor [TLR] agonists like LPS), frequently intensified by injurious agonists generated by the infected organism. The MK-PLT axis plays a major role in orchestrating sepsis-related thromboinflammatory and immunothrombotic events [7,32,33,34,35]. MKs were demonstrated to synergistically react to TLR 2/4 agonists in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling by increasing their proliferation, and thrombopoiesis [36]. However, this effect could only be observed in immature CD34+ cells, while MKs in the past 7 days of culture demonstrated slightly decreasing numbers when treated with LPS. Finally, PLT aggregation and the formation of heterotypic PLT-leukocyte aggregates in septic patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [37,38,39]. Nevertheless, the direct impact of PLTs in the pathobiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, several cell biology aspects, and mechanistic insight into PLT and MK functions during septic events are still obscure. The purification and functional characterization of a 53 kDa protein facilitating nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells was first described in 1984 [40]. The NAP-family, including nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), is a group of proteins with chaperone function, capable of binding histones and coordinating their assemblance into nucleosomal particles [41]. Several additional binding partners for NAP-family members were identified, including transcription factors, proteins regulating nuclear import (karyopherins), and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [41]). Specifically, NAP1L1 was described to promote proliferation of pluripotent stem cells [42] through cell cycle interference. Furthermore, NAP1L1, in concert with NAP1L4, can act as a histone chaperone [43], and serving as a co-factor for ubiquitination client selection [44]. Furthermore, numerous studies describe NAP1L1 as a prognostic marker in select cancer entities (i.e., colon cancer [45], hepatocellular carcinoma [46], ovarian cancer [47], and lung cancer [48]), and its involvement in a number of signaling pathways, which were demonstrated to result in tumor progression. NAP1L1 mRNA expression in human PLTs was previously described [49]; however, no function was assigned to this versatile nuclear protein in such anucleate cells, or its progenitors, MKs. Here, we demonstrate that MKs and human PLTs endogenously express differential NAP1L1 mRNA variants and protein isoforms. We identified PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex), as a protein interaction partner. In PLTs, septic conditions induced increased expression of NAP1L1 protein, and PDH complex activity. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs resulted in reduced proplatelet formation, and decreased PDH complex activity when treated with LPS, simulating a septic environment. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified NAP1L1 interaction partner in human PLTs and MKs. Furthermore, this newly described protein–protein interaction seems to influence PDH complex activity, with subsequent functional disturbances of these specialized cells.2. Results 2.1. CD34+-Derived MKs and Freshly Isolated Human PLTs Express NAP1L1 We initially sought to determine RNA expression patterns of NAP1L1 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived MKs and freshly isolated human PLTs. Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MKs and human PLTs express messenger RNA (mRNA) for NAP1L1 (Figure 1A,B). Consistent with its expression demonstrated via RNA-seq, NAP1L1 mRNA was also detected in MKs using PCR techniques (Figure 1C). NAP1L1 was consistently expressed over the entire time course of MK culture and differentiation. Furthermore, NAP1L1 was readily detectable in RNA samples isolated from human PLTs (Figure 1D). Of note, all PLT samples used for these studies were DNase treated to exclude any DNA contaminants from nucleated cells. Figure 1. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express mRNA for NAP1L1. RNA-seq snapshots taken from the Integrated Genome Browser of the NAP1L1 transcript in CD34+-derived MKs (A) and human PLTs (B) (representative for n = 3). The height on the y-axis represents the relative accumulated number of reads spanning a particular sequence. The average of the read depths across all genomic coordinates within a transcript correlate to abundance of RNA expression. NAP1L1 transcript regions are represented below the plots by thick (exon) and thin (intron) lines. (C) MKs at culture days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 were examined for NAP1L1 expression by PCR. NT represents the reverse transcription (RT) reaction using no template, NE represents the RT reaction using no enzyme. Both controls were performed to control for contaminating nuclear DNA. Bottom, B2M as a loading control. This figure is representative of 5 independent experiments. (D) RNA from freshly isolated PLTs at baseline was isolated and NAP1L1 mRNA expression was evaluated by PCR. This figure is representative of 3 independent experiments. The -PCR lane shows the negative control for the PCR reaction, lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane.Since multiple alternative transcripts are described to exist for NAP1L1, we next performed PCR experiments using a primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7, enabling us to detect a potential alternative NAP1L1 transcript variant 5, which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 (Figure 2A). MKs as well as PLT samples demonstrated the presence of PCR products indicative of NAP1L1 transcript variant 1 (Figure 2B,C), PCR product band indicated at ~600 bp) and transcript variant 5 (Figure 2B,C, PCR product band indicated at ~400 bp). These findings were verified by Sanger sequencing for excised PCR products, demonstrating full length transcript as well as a transcript devoid of exon 3 and 4 (data not shown). In addition, we were able to detect NAP1L1 transcript variants at all stages of MK differentiation (Figure 2B). Furthermore, allowing the incubation of PLTs overnight (Figure 2C), or the placement of PLTs on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulating the cells using thrombin (Supplementary Figure S1) did not alter the expression pattern of alternative transcripts; therefore, no loading control was included. Figure 2. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express alternative NAP1L1 transcript variants. (A) Schematic representation of the organization of exons in NAP1L1 transcript variant 1 (top), and transcript variant 5 (bottom) missing exons 3 and 4. Primer binding sites for transcript variant 1 detection (green, as used in Figure 1) and transcript variant 5 (orange), and the expected PCR products (dark red) are indicated. (B) MKs at culture days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 were examined for NAP1L1 expression by PCR. NT represents the reverse transcription (RT) reaction using no template, NE represents the RT reaction using no enzyme. Both controls were performed to control for contaminating nuclear DNA. Bottom, B2M as a loading control. This figure is representative of 5 independent experiments. (C) RNA from freshly isolated PLTs at baseline (BL) and after culture overnight (ON) was isolated and NAP1L1 mRNA expression was evaluated by PCR. This figure is representative of 10 independent experiments. The -PCR lane shows the negative control for the PCR reaction, lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. Relevant PCR products are indicated by yellow arrows.Consistent with our findings by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Figure 1 and Figure 2, and data not shown), we found that NAP1L1 protein is endogenously and robustly expressed in situ in the cytoplasm and proplatelet extensions of MKs (Figure 3A). It is interesting to note that NAP1L1 protein localization in MKs is less pronounced in cell nuclei; however, it demonstrates some peri-nuclear enhancement. Furthermore, cells undergoing anaphase showed reduced NAP1L1 association with condensed chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S2). While nucleosome assembly proteins were initially identified as being histone chaperones and chromatin-assembly factors, additional functions were assigned including tissue-specific transcription regulation, apoptosis, histone shuttling, cell-cycle regulation, and additional chaperone functions beyond histone binding [41]. Our microscopic findings in MKs could potentially point towards such extra nuclear functions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab MKs and human PLTs express NAP1L1 protein. (A) CD34+-derived MKs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen to induce proplatelet formation, fixed, and then incubated with an antibody against NAP1L1 (yellow, top right panel) or an IgG control, followed by co-staining for b-tubulin (magenta) and nuclei (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI, blue), as shown in the bottom panels. Scale bars = 20 µm. This figure is representative of n = 7 independent experiments. (B) NAP1L1 protein expression (green) in human PLTs. PLTs incubated with an IgG control antibody are shown (left, IgG). The bottom panels show the corresponding transmission images overlayed with the co-staining with WGA (red). Scale bars = 10 µm. This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Immunoblot analysis of MK lysates (day 13 of culture) using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. NAP1L1 isoforms are highlighted by a red box. (D) Immunoblot analysis of PLT lysates using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis; however, the samples were split and processed in parallel in the absence (left) or presence (right) of an NAP1L1-quenching peptide. The presence of the blocking peptide prevents the detection of NAP1L1 with the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, demonstrating specificity for the three main NAP1L1 protein isoforms. Lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. (C,D), representative of 3 and 8 independent experiments, respectively.In unstimulated human PLTs, NAP1L1 protein concentrated and accumulated peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern (Figure 3B). Immunoblotting also confirmed our microscopic findings of NAP1L1 protein being present in MKs (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, Western blotting revealed three major protein bands at 60, 53 and 37 kDa, while the predicted size for NAP1L1 protein (expected isoform 1) is 43–53 kDa. Therefore, we sought to examine the specificity of the used anti-NAP1L1 antibody. A peptide competition assay (quench experiment) using the immunogenic peptide (Figure 3D, right) showed that all three detected protein bands specifically represent NAP1L1 isoforms or potentially post-translational modified NAP1L1 in human PLT samples (Figure 3D, left).2.2. NAP1L1 Directly Interacts with the Dihydrolipopolylysine-Residue Acetyltransferase Component of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC-E2, ODP2) Because of its multitude of functions described in the literature, and its widely unknown roles in MK and PLT cell biology, we next wanted to identify NAP1L1 protein binding partners in human PLTs. To identify such interaction partners, we used carefully controlled co-IP experiments followed by mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses of a selected band. We identified a highly specific protein, which was only present in the specific anti-NAP1L1 pull-down (Figure 4A, second lane from left); however, was absent in the isotype-specific IgG control (Figure 4A, third lane from left). Furthermore, we excluded non-specific binding to the protein G magnetic beads by including a control condition using those beads only (Figure 4A, right lane). Figure 4. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 directly interacts with PDC-E2. (A) Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel were stained for total protein using standard MS-compatible silver staining. The left lane shows proteins isolated after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The middle lane shows proteins isolated after co-IP with non-immunogenic, control IgG. The right lane shows proteins isolated after the use of protein-G beads only. Red box marks selected protein band subsequently used in MS analysis. This figure is representative of n = 5 independent experiments. (B) Bar graph showing the total spectrum count per protein. Black bars show counts for MS performed after control IgG experiment; non-filled bars demonstrated spectrum counts for proteins identified after co-IP using anti-NAP1L1. Total spectrum counts for PDC-E2 are indicated by red asterisk. (C) Bar graph showing the normalized spectrum count (normalized to all total spectrum counts) for PDC-E2. Black bar represents counts for MS performed after control IgG experiment; non-filled bar show spectrum counts for PDC-E2 identified after co-IP using anti-NAP1L1. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0271. (D) A corresponding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel was analyzed using immunoblotting technique. Co-IP proteins were probed using an anti-PDC-E2 antibody. The left lane shows proteins isolated after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The middle lane shows proteins isolated after co-IP with non-immunogenic, control IgG. The right lane shows proteins isolated after the use of protein-G beads only. Red box and yellow arrow mark PDC-E2 protein detected as being co-IP’ed using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, indicating protein–protein interaction. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments.Besides contaminating human cytokeratin, which was most likely introduced during protein processing, we found the highest total spectrum count being present for ODP2_HUMAN (Figure 4B), the human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component (PDC-E2). The highly specific nature of this identified NAP1L1 binding partner was further underscored by its significantly increased normalized spectrum count for peptide sequences, when compared to samples co-IPed using IgG (Figure 4C). Consistent with its expression pattern at the peptide level, immunoblotting demonstrated robust and specifically detectable NAP1L1—PDC-E2 protein interaction in human PLTs (Figure 4D) using Western blot approaches. PDC-E2—human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase is the E2 component of the multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). In nucleated cells, DLAT, the gene encoding PDC-E2, is part of the nuclear DNA, and upon translation, the protein needs to be transported to the inner mitochondria membrane. Here, the enzyme transfers acetyl groups to coenzyme A. In addition, PDC can also be present in the nucleus catalyzing histone acetylation [50,51]. In turn, PDC-E2 is also the key antigen in primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic liver disease with autoimmune component targeting intrahepatic bile duct lining cells [52,53].2.3. NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 Show Dynamic Expression Changes When PLTs Are Exposed to Septic Conditions NAP1L1 was previously assigned chaperone and transport functions, involving histone complexes [54,55], diacylglycerol kinase ζ [56], mtHsp70 [57]. Here, we add an additional interaction partner, PDC-E2, to the evolving functional repertoire of NAP1L1. With PDC-E2 being an integral part of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, we started exploring functional consequences of the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction. Several studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gets dysregulated due to septic host environment [58,59]. Although anucleate, emerging data demonstrates that the human PLT transcriptome is not static. Rather, the PLT transcriptome is dynamic and markedly altered during systemic inflammatory diseases [6,7,22,26]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 protein expression levels in human PLTs isolated from septic patients. To determine whether transcripts coding for NAP1L1 were altered in PLTs during sepsis, we used RNA-seq on highly purified PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy donors. This study was performed as a sub-analysis of a dataset previously published by our group [8]. Figure 5A demonstrates the significant increase in mRNA coding for NAP1L1 in PLTs isolated from septic patients. Figure 5. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 shows dynamic protein expression changes when PLTs are exposed to septic conditions. PLTs were isolated from healthy individuals or septic patients within 48 h of ICU admission. (A) Total RNA was isolated and next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). Data show the RPKM expression for NAP1L1 for healthy (grey), and septic (non-filled) samples. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0001. (B) PLTs were fixed in suspension immediately after isolation. Immunofluorescence staining with an anti-NAP1L1 (green) antibody demonstrates robust expression of NAP1L1 protein in PLTs from septic patients and healthy PLTs (scale bars: 10 µm). Cells were co-stained using WGA (red). This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Micrographs were analyzed using CellProfiler. The bar graph displays the mean intensity over all stained cells for NAP1L1, normalized to IgG. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0505. (D) PLTs from healthy individuals and septic patients were isolated. NAP1L1 protein expression levels were detected by Western blot. Positions of NAP1L1 isoforms are marked. Corresponding tubulin is shown at the bottom and was used for normalization of data presented in bar graph shown in (E) below. This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. Analyzed using Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.0368.Having detected significantly increased NAP1L1 transcript levels in PLTs from septic patients, we hypothesized that NAP1L1 protein expression would similarly be altered during sepsis. We initially used immunofluorescence staining (ICC) to examine NAP1L1 protein expression and localization in PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy control donors. NAP1L1 staining was localized peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern (Figure 5B). In septic PLTs, using automated image analysis, we detected an increased mean fluorescent intensity for NAP1L1 (Figure 5C), which translated into a significant fold-increase of staining intensity (data not shown). To further test the above hypothesis, we used Western blot analysis to examine total PLT NAP1L1 protein expression. Figure 5D,E demonstrate significantly increased NAP1L1 protein expression in PLTs from septic patients. In contrast to the increased NAP1L1 expression, Western blot analysis for PDC-E2 showed significantly decreased total protein expression in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy controls (Figure 6A,B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab PDC-E2 protein levels and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity is increased in PLTs during sepsis. PLTs from healthy individuals and septic patients were isolated. (A) PDC-E2 protein expression levels were detected by Western blot. Position of PDC-E2 is marked. Corresponding actin (ACTB) is shown at the bottom and was used for the normalization of data presented in the bar graph shown in (B) below. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0360. (C) Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity assay was performed on PLTs isolated from septic (n = 13) and healthy (n = 11) individuals. Bar graph depicts mean optical signal ± SEM. Analyzed using t-test, p = 0.0278.2.4. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Activity Is Increased in PLTs during Sepsis The immunometabolism during sepsis is characterized by a switch from a high-energy infection resistance mode to a low-energy conservation tolerance mode within 4–8 h after sepsis dissemination [58]. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex acts as an energy homeostat, and its deactivation creates an energy supply chain shortage during sepsis. Here, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity was significantly increased in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy donor PLTs (Figure 6C), which could indicate an early stage in the septic continuum.2.5. NAP1L1 Overexpression in MKs Induced Reduced Proplatelet Formation (PPF) To further establish potential functional consequences of the newly described NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction, we utilized an established CD34+-derived human MK cell culture model [23,24,31,60]. MKs are PLT precursor cells, contain many of the same proteins and pathways as PLTs, and are often used as a relevant model system to study PLT responses [8,60,61]. While PLTs are only extremely difficult or not at all accessible to modifications of their transcriptome, MKs have been genetically modified using several different techniques [62,63]. Here, we used “liposome-based transfection” utilizing the transfer of in vitro transcribed, capped, and poly(A) tailed NAP1L1 mRNA into MKs (Figure 7A), to induce transient overexpression of NAP1L1. Figure 7B demonstrates the successful overexpression of NAP1L1 protein in MKs. In contrast to PLTs isolated from septic patients, the exposure of human MKs to an agonist commonly generated during sepsis (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) did result in a slight decrease of the endogenous NAP1L1 protein level, independent of the transfection. In addition, treatment of transfected cells with LPS did also not lead to NAP1L1 protein levels above the non-LPS but transfected condition. We next analyzed proplatelet formation (PPF), an energy intensive hallmark functional determinate of MKs in NAP1L1 transfected cell cultures. We were able to show that NAP1L1 protein overexpression in non-treated cells, and even more pronounced in with LPS-treated cells, significantly decreased PPF (Figure 7C,D). Additional co-IP experiments using MKs demonstrated increased NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction when cells were exposed to LPS (Supplementary Figure S3A). Furthermore, consistent with the PPF data indicating decreased functional capacity of MKs under septic conditions, LPS treatment decreased the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in our culture model (Supplementary Figure S3B). Figure 7. Open in a new tab NAP1L1 overexpression in MKs results in decreased (PPF). (A) Schematic of protocol for NAP1L1 overexpression in MKs. Functional elements of the NAP1L1 expression plasmid are demonstrated. (B) Immunoblot analysis of MK lysates (day 13 of culture) using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. Cells were lysed and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Samples undergoing transfection with the in vitro transcribed NAP1L1 mRNA are labeled with NAP1L1; LPS-treatment groups are indicated. The bar graph shows a fold increase over non-treated cells (NoTx). This figure is representative of n = 2/3 independent experiments, as indicated by single data points. Analyzed using one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison, p = 0.0310. (C) Plot of percentages of day 13 MKs with PPs after being not treated (noTx), treated with LPS, or undergoing NAP1L1 transfection (NAP1L1).

Discussion The MK-PLT axis is increasingly recognized as being more intricate and sophisticated in cellular responsibilities and abilities than historically expected. MKs are not only producing PLTs in the bone marrow through thrombopoiesis but are also intimately involved in setting up the PLT immune potential. MKs invest PLTs with the molecular composition to take center stage as responders and immune sentinels in the initiation and propagation of coordinated host immune responses [64]. Furthermore, while PLTs are anucleate, it has been demonstrated that they contain a complex transcriptome [20,49] and regulatory pathways, including cytoplasmic splicing, controlling important biologic tasks [22,23,24,26,27,28,60,65,66,67]. In concert with these signal-dependent pathways, it was demonstrated that PLTs possess nuclear proteins. In a comprehensive PLT proteome analysis, 13% of all identified proteins were mapped to a nuclear location [68]. PLTs utilize such proteins in established functions, as well as assigning alternative roles. Amongst other nuclear proteins, MKs distribute a functional spliceosome to PLTs [23,24]. In addition, nuclear receptors, including the receptors for sex steroids, glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)s, and retinoid X receptors (RXR)s were detected in PLTs, reported to bind their respective ligands, which induce PLT aggregation and activation (reviewed in [69]). Unexpectedly, RAR was also demonstrated to be utilized by PLTs as a translational regulator [28]. RAR is additionally employed in non-genomic activities by controlling actin cytoskeletal events [31]. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data exploring and finally comparing the functional capacities of nuclear proteins in PLTs with their counterparts residing in MKs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that NAP1L1 mRNA is expressed in PLTs demonstrating potential transcript variants previously not detected in PLTs (Figure 1 and Figure 2, and Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, we identify a protein interaction partner, PDC-E2, hitherto not characterized as being part of the NAP1L1 protein network (Figure 4). Using septic PLTs, we were able to also demonstrate a dynamic protein expression pattern of NAP1L1 and its interaction partner PDC-E2, potentially resulting in altered pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity (Figure 5 and Figure 6). In addition, using human MK cells, we were able to show that overexpression of NAP1L1 results in diminished proplatelet formation, and decreased PDC-E2-dependent PDH activity (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S3). Our analyses of MKs and PLTs are also the first to examine NAP1L1 transcript levels and protein expression pattern. While NAP1L1 mRNA was previously detected in human PLTs [49,70], no in-depth analysis of potential transcript variants, changes in transcript levels, or specific protein expression or localization analysis was performed. Consistent with previous RNA sequencing results, we observed expression of NAP1L1 mRNA using RNA sequencing techniques as well as confirmatory PCR approaches for PLT as well as MK samples, harvested throughout the MK culture period (Figure 1). Next, we designed a PCR primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7. This enabled us to detect alternative transcript processing in MKs and PLTs resulting in NAP1L1 transcript variant 5 (NM_001330232.2), which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 (Figure 2). This suggests that alternative splicing of NAP1L1 occurs in MKs, and that PLTs get invested with such alternative transcripts by MKs. It is interesting to note that the transcript variant ratios did not change due to activation of PLTs using immobilized fibrinogen and thrombin (Supplementary Figure S1), indicating that the alternative splicing process does not occur in the PLT cell bodies. NAP1L1 transcript variant 5 is coding for the putative NAP1L1 isoform 3 (NP_001317161.1), which misses the N-terminal domain I. Domain I is mainly responsible for dimerization of NAP1L1 and mediating histone interaction [54,55,71]. The presence of transcript variant 5, coding for a protein with a deleted functional domain, could be indicative of alternative protein functions of NAP1L1, besides the nucleosome assembly task in MKs and human PLTs. Taken together, these initial findings focused on NAP1L1 transcripts demonstrated the presence of at least two NAP1L1 transcript variants (1 and 5) and raised the question regarding whether NAP1L1 protein isoforms are located in MK and PLT cell bodies. Using initial microscopy studies, we were able to demonstrate NAP1L1 protein in MKs, their proplatelet extensions (Figure 3A), as well as in PLT cell bodies in a peri-granular pattern. While not performing detailed co-localization studies, the images from PLT studies support the finding that NAP1L1 protein does most likely not reside within the PLT granular compartment (Figure 3B). Interestingly, NAP1L1 protein signals demonstrate minimal co-localization with nuclear/DNA co-staining signals when examining dividing MK-progenitors (Supplementary Figure S2). Despite the known NAP-family members functions in DNA replication and cell proliferation [72], and the previously described changing intracellular localization [41], this could furthermore point towards an alternative cellular function assigned to NAP1L1 in the MK-PLT axis. To confirm our microscopy data, we next examine NAP1L1 protein expression using Western blot analysis (Figure 3C,D). Our studies specifically demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of at least three different NAP1L1 isoforms in MKs and PLTs. This finding is consistent with the initial description of NAP1L1 and subsequent publications, which showed Western blot results indicating the existence of multiple NAP1L1 protein isoforms [40,43,73]. To exclude cross-reactivity of the detection antibody, which could lead to false positive results, we performed peptide competition assays clearly demonstrating the specificity of our findings. The difference between observed and predicted molecular weight for NAP1L1 proteins, shown in our study, can be explained by potential post-translational modifications. NAP1L1, as part of the human NAP1L-family members, is known to contain C-terminal glutamylation sites, creating a reversible acidic C-terminal moiety, with the potential of switching between different protein functions [55,74,75], but also resulting in changed migration during SDS-PAGE. This potential mechanism of post-translational protein and also functional modification was highlighted in a recent publication [76]. Ye and colleagues demonstrated that MKs contain the enzymatic machinery necessary for performing and reversing polyglutamylations, namely tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family (TTLL) members TTLL4 and TTLL6, and cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) 6. Therefore, differential protein isoform as well as specific post-translational modifications could be displayed by the detected NAP1L1 signals. To explore additional NAP1L1 functions, besides the traditionally assigned roles, we wanted to further explore if new protein partners interacting with NAP1L1 could be identified in MKs and PLTs. Using co-IP techniques, we were able to reproduce a highly specific protein band, which could be identified and verified as PDC-E2, the protein product of DLAT (Figure 4). PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Recent studies indicated that PDC is also present in the nucleus and processes/catalyzes histone acetylation [51,77], and its subunit PDC-E2 can act as a nuclear transcriptional regulator [78]. PDC-E2, also called dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, is the acceptor molecule for acetyl groups formed by the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and transfers them to coenzyme A. Of note, in addition to its essential role in cellular metabolism, PDC-E2 is the key autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) [53]. Like many mitochondrial proteins, PDC-E2 is encoded by the nuclear genome and translated in the cytoplasm with an amino-terminal targeting sequence [79,80]. A direct interaction of NAP-family members with mitochondrial proteins is not unprecedented. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, Stelzl and colleagues created extensive protein–protein interaction maps, demonstrating that NAP1L1 interacted with dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2), a component of the mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex [81]. Furthermore, Okada et al. [56] demonstrated that NAP1L1 interacted with diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which prohibited its nuclear import through blocking import carrier protein interaction. Therefore, in MKs, one might speculate if the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction could serve a similar import–export control pathway. Because of its clinical relevance, we decided to study NAP1L1 expression and potential function in a common, morbid, and often fatal systemic inflammatory disease—sepsis. We detected an increase in NAP1L1 transcript in human PLTs, a finding which was paralleled by the protein expression data shown via immune detection of NAP1L1 (Figure 5). These findings pointed towards a dynamic regulation of NAP1L1 in septic PLTs, a clinical situation NAP1L1 was never studied under. Next, we examined PDC-E2 protein expression pattern in septic PLTs (Figure 6). PDC-E2 protein expression levels decreased in septic PLTs. However, PDH complex activity increased 13-fold over the metabolic activity measured in PLTs isolated from healthy individuals. This finding could be met with surprise since published studies indicate that the PDH complex is inhibited during sepsis, resulting in a switch from mitochondrial aerobic oxidation to cytoplasmic anaerobic glycolysis, a process known to contribute to the formation of lactic acid and intracellular acidosis, which can lead to intracellular Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial membrane damage [58,82,83]. Nevertheless, contrasting the general PDC-dependent metabolic reprogramming response in sepsis [58,84,85], several studies demonstrated that mitochondrial oxygen consumption in PLTs is increased in septic patients, and closely related to their survival rate [86,87,88]. Therefore, based on our observations, we speculate that due to its chaperone and potential shuttling function, NAP1L1 protein in septic PLTs could help stabilize the conformation of PDC-E2 molecules, and also mediate the known one-way transport [89] into the mitochondrial compartment. To confirm these results, the next step would be to genetically modify the target cells to demonstrate functional coherence. However, it is difficult to produce transfected and genetically modified uniform, high-quality human PLTs. Therefore, to further decipher the functional and mechanistic impact of NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction on the MK-PLT axis, we utilized a well-established PLT-surrogate MK culture model, as previously used by our laboratory [7,23,24,31]. To mimic increased NAP1L1 protein levels in septic PLTs, we used “liposome-based transfection” techniques (Figure 7A). Using this approach, NAP1L1 could be robustly overexpressed in the human MK culture system (Figure 7B). Transfected or vehicle-treated MKs were subsequently incubated with LPS, one of the major determinants in Gram-negative sepsis [90]. It is important to note that LPS uses a well-established signaling pathway through TLR4, which is expressed by CD34+-derived MKs [36]. In contrast to our septic PLT experiments, we observed that LPS treatment alone resulted in slightly decreased NAP1L1 expression levels. Performing a proplatelet formation (PPF) assay [17], a standard read-out for MK function, we detected decreased PPF when NAP1L1 was overexpressed in MKs. In addition, it appeared that NAP1L1 protein overexpression and simulated septic conditions using LPS treatment, synergistically reduced PPF (Figure 7C,D). During their final stages, MKs produce PLTs by extending long cytoplasmic protrusions, designated proplatelets [9], into sinusoidal blood vessels, a process coined PPF. While two independent, but interrelated cytoskeletal systems, actin filaments and tubulin subunits, provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation [10], it was elegantly shown that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. The rolling up of microtubules as they drive apart and extend the proplatelet is likely to be involved in forming the coils found in the proplatelet tips and the mature PLTs, called marginal band. The production of force with its synchronized cycles of microtubule binding and release, is energy consuming, using the hydrolysis of ATP [12]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction and PDH complex activity in MKs under simulated septic conditions, which might explain the decreased PPF. LPS-treated MKs demonstrated increased interactions between NAP1L1 and PDC-E2, and a significantly decreased PDH complex activity (Supplementary Figure S3). These findings contrast our experimental results from septic PLTs. Nevertheless, opposite NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction levels, and PDH complex activity could potentially be explained by PLTs being anucleate, and therefore potentially using NAP1L1 protein in a different context than nucleated MKs. In PLTs, it seems more likely that NAP1L1 function could be defined and garnered towards chaperoning PDC-E2. Contrastingly, in MKs, NAP1L1 could help in the compartmentalization of PDC-E2, and therefore prohibiting the protein from entering its functional complex PDC, as it was shown for DGKζ [56]. In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is closely related with clinical outcome. In this context, our MK data also complements previous reports demonstrating that one potential mechanism for low PLT counts in severely ill patients with advanced thrombocytopenia could be diminished thrombopoiesis [91,92]. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate about potential upstream signaling mechanisms triggering, and potentially enabling the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction. In 1999, Cataldo and colleagues reported that Mpl (thrombopoietin, TPO), ligand of the Mpl-c receptor, regulates NAP1 family member expression in a rat bone marrow model [93]. The authors were able to demonstrate that these NAP-related effects were limited to Mpl and could not be reproduced by other bone marrow growth factors (i.e., granulocate colony stimulating factor), which led to the conclusion of a cytokine specific effect. These results can be interpreted as a TPO-specific signaling pathway integrating sensing of PLT numbers, stimulation of progenitor cells by Mpl, and subsequent modulation of protein interactions. The involvement of the Mpl (TPO) signaling pathway in the newly discovered NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction will therefore be a focus of future studies. The presented study was data driven and performed under best research practice. Nevertheless, there are some limitations to this study. Since the generation of the presented data, CRISPR-Cas9 technique has been developed for rapid genetic manipulation of MKs [62]. For future studies we would propose to use such an approach for further dissecting the mechanistic function of PDC-E2 in MKs in greater detail. We appreciate the descriptive character of our study; however, this is the first report of NAP1L1 interacting specifically with a previously unrecognized partner protein. Therefore, we recognize that our findings should be extended in future studies, potentially complemented by in vivo work using relevant mouse models. In conclusion, our data demonstrate NAP1L1 expression in human PLTs and MKs. This is the first time that expression of different NAP1L1 transcript variants, and protein isoform was confirmed in such cells. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that NAP1L1 interacts with PDC-E2, a subunit of the PDH complex. The PDH complex acts as an energy homeostat bridging glycolysis to energy production, and its function gets modulated during sepsis, carbohydrate metabolism away from mitochondrial oxidation. Our data shed new light on such processes taking place in PLTs and MKs during sepsis. At the moment, however, it remains undetermined how NAP1L1 functions are coordinated when comparing nucleated versus anucleate state. Nevertheless, our results support the conclusion of differential functions of NAP1L1 in MKs and PLTs during systemic inflammation and open a new avenue of sepsis research focused on the MK-PLT axis.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents and Antibodies The following reagents and antibodies were used for microscopy, Western blot, and co-IP studies as described below: Paraformaldehyde (PFA 4% [2% final]), Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, W32464), Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate of phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A22287), 4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306), mouse anti-NAP1L1 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab58677), rabbit anti-NAP1L1 (abcam, ab33076), rabbit anti-Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component E2 (PDC-E2, ODP2; abcam, ab 66511), rabbit anti-beta tubulin (abcam, ab232361), mouse anti-tubulin (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA, T-5293), mouse anti-ACTB/actin HRP-conjugated (abcam, ab20272), and NAP1L1 blocking peptide (abcam, ab22418). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 and 546 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (G-21040, G-21234, S11223, A-11001, A-11008, A-21422, A-21428).4.2. Septic Patients Patients were selected for meeting consensus criteria for sepsis [94], and enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively).4.3. PLT Isolation and Culture PLTs used for the described studies were freshly isolated. PLTs were leukocyte-reduced and isolated, as previously described to yield a highly purified population of cells with <1 leukocyte per 107 PLTs [23,24,66]. In addition, PLT activation during centrifugation steps was mitigated by the addition of 100 nM prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1) before each centrifugation step. Depleted PLTs were resuspended at 1 × 108/mL in a serum-free M199 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11150067), placed in round-bottom polypropylene tubes, and incubated, where indicated, in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO2 for different time points. In select studies, PLTs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulated with thrombin (factor IIa), as previously described [24].4.4. CD34+-Derived MKs CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and differentiated into proplatelet-producing MKs, as previously described [23,24,31].4.5. RNA Isolation MKs or PLTs were lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA isolation was performed, as previously described [23,24]. All RNA samples were DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1907) per manufacturer’s protocol.4.6. Next Generation RNA-Sequencing For next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), 1 × 109 isolated PLTs were carefully lysed in TRIzol and DNase treated, as described above. Total RNA was isolated, as previously described [22,25,31,49,95]. An Agilent bio-analyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to quantify the amount and quality of the total RNA. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores were similar between all samples. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with TruSeq V2 with oligo-dT selection (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA, RS-122-2001). Reads were aligned (Novoalign) to the reference genome at the time of these studies (GRCh37/hg19) and a pseudo-transcriptome containing splice junctions. The Deseq2 analysis package was used to assign reads to composite transcripts (one per gene) and quantitate reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads/RPKMs.4.7. PCR Studies To determine NAP1L1 mRNA expression pattern in human PLTs and CD34+-derived MKs, primers spanning exon 8–10 (248 bp product) of NAP1L1 (NAP1L1_1012_forward 5′-AGT GAA GTT CTC AGA TGC TGG-3′ and NAP1L1_1259_reverse 5′-CAC GTC CCT TGT GTT TCT GC-3′) and primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 (588 bp and 399 bp products) of NAP1L1 (NAP1L1_460_forward 5′-AGT CGC CGA TAT TTG GAG TTC T-3′ and NAP1L1_1047_reverse 5′-TCC TGA ACC ATA TCA CTG AGC A-3′) were used (in-house synthesis) and PCR was performed. Loading control primers detecting B2M mRNA were used on paralleling samples (B2M_34_forward 5′-AGC TGA CAG CAT TCG GGC-3′ and B2M_333_reverse GTG GGG GTG AAT TCA GTG TAG T-3′). Annealing temperatures were selected as follows: primers spanning exon 8–10 of NAP1L1, 60 °C; primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 of NAP1L1, 58 °C; primers detecting B2M, 57 °C.4.8. Immunocytochemistry On day 13 of the CD34+- differentiation process, MKs were placed on fibrinogen-coated chamber slides to induce proplatelet formation, fixed (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AC327372500) for 5 min at room temperature (RT), and subsequently incubated with IgG, or an antibody against NAP1L1, and anti-b-tubulin antibody for co-staining purposes, overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or 546, followed by co-staining using DAPI for nuclear localization. In select studies (see Supplementary Figure S2), MKs were incubated with IgG or an antibody against NAP1L1, followed by co-staining for sialic acids/glycoproteins (in cell membranes/granular content) and the actin cytoskeleton using WGA or phalloidin, respectively. Freshly isolated PLTs were fixed in suspension using PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AC327372500) for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and subsequently layered onto VECTABONDTM (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, SP1800) coated coverslips using a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon Cytospin, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated with IgG (to control for specificity of signal) or an antibody against NAP1L1 overnight at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or 546. Sialic acids/glycoproteins (in cell membranes/granular content) were co-stained using WGA.4.9. Microscopy and Image Analysis Fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution confocal reflection microscopy were performed using an Olympus IX81, FV300 (Olympus, Melville, NY) confocal-scanning microscope equipped with a 60×/1.42 NA oil objective for viewing PLTs. An Olympus FVS-PSU/IX2-UCB camera and scanning unit and Olympus Fluoview FV 300 image acquisition software version 5.0 were used for recording. In addition, an EVOS FL Auto Cell imaging system with an integrated dual camera system, system-specific software and equipped with a 609/1.42 NA oil objective was used. Monochrome 16-bit images were further analyzed, and changes were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS6, ImageJ (), and CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org (last accessed on 1 October 2022)) [96]. Analysis of images presented in Figure 5B was performed with a customized CellProfiler analysis set. In brief, raw images were automatically analyzed to minimize observer bias. The following software parameters were introduced: threshold method—otsu (this approach calculates the threshold separating three classes of pixels by minimizing the variance within each class); threshold correction factor—2.5 (a value > 1 makes the threshold more stringent, since the otsu method will give a slightly biased threshold if a larger percentage of the image is covered with positive signal).4.10. Protein Expression Studies All samples were normalized for starting cell concentrations. PLTs were lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 or PDC-E2/ODP2 expression patterns. Subsequently, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32132). Linear range of detection was assured by using the saturation detection mode of the myECL Imager (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For select studies a peptide competition assay was performed. In brief, a PVDF membrane loaded equally was split in half, and probed using anti-NAP1L1 antibodies pre-incubated with or without specific NAP1L1 peptide fragment (blocking peptide; incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer (TBS, Tween, non-fat dry milk)). Specific protein expression was normalized using ACTB/actin or b-tubulin expression and quantified using ImageJ ().4.11. Co-Immunoprecipitation Studies For all modified protein co-IP studies, the Universal Magnetic Co-IP Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 54002) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol; however, magnetic beads were replaced using protein G magnetic beads specifically suited for immunoprecipitation (Dynabeads; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10003D). In brief, 2 × 109 total PLTs, or MKs were first pelleted and washed in PBS supplemented with phosphatase and deacetylase inhibitors. Cells were then lysed in 300 µL of the provided whole-cell lysis buffer and an additional protease inhibitor cocktail supplied by the manufacturer. The magnetic beads used for the IP reaction were either incubated with the antibody of interest (anti-NAP1L1) or the respective IgG control for 30 min at RT. Co-IP was performed using the prepared beads, the supplied buffer and the PLT cell lysate from 0.6 × 109 PLTs or MKs with constant rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The IP complexes were isolated and cleaned by placing the samples on a magnetic stand and performing repeated washes with the provided wash-buffer. Finally, each bead pellet was resuspended in 20 µL of Laemmli-buffer and heated to 99 °C for 3 min before being separated using SDS-PAGE or Western blot techniques, as described above. For mass spectrometry purposes, gels were directly stained using standard MS-compatible silver staining.4.12. Mass Spectrometry Protein bands of interest were manually picked using standard techniques to ensure minimal contamination with human skin particles. Excised protein bands were de-stained, extracted proteins were trypsin digested per established standard methods, and analyzed by an LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS coupled with a nano-acquity UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) mass spectrometer with electro-spray ionization at the University of Greifswald at the Institute of Functional Genome Research. Repeat MS/MS fragmentation was controlled by applying dynamic exclusion using one repeat count, a repeat duration of 30 s, an exclusion list size of 500, and an exclusion duration of 60 s. Peptides were identified using SEQUEST [97], and analyzed using Scaffold (v.27 r.11, Proteome Software, Portland OR, USA) and the peptide/protein prophet algorithm [98], which was linked to the Uni-PROT/SWISS-PROT (human_v2014_02) data base, resulting in total spectrum counts per identified protein. Analysis settings included a peptide mass tolerance of 5 ppm, fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da, monoisotopic masses and trypsin cleavage (maximum two missed cleavages). Protein identifications were accepted when p < 0.05 after adjustment using the Scaffold mass correction, resulting in a false discovery rate of <1%.4.13. PDH Activity Assay All samples prepared and used for the performance of the PDH activity assay were normalized by cell number. The assay was conducted following the manufacturer’s protocol (abcam, ab109882). In brief, 50 µL of each sample was used and an equal volume of blocking fluid was added to a 96-well plate. The dipstick was dipped into the well and the sample allowed to wick onto the dipstick for 60 min. The dipstick was washed, and an activity buffer was added for 20 min. Since the activity reaction is an endpoint reaction, each dipstick was exposed for precisely monitored equal exposure times. The reaction was stopped using ddH2O. The results were documented using imaging scan techniques, and the signal was quantified using ImageJ ().4.14. NAP1L1 In Vitro Transcription NAP1L1 was in vitro transcribed using a commercially available NAP1L1 expression plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD, USA, RC201851) containing a T7 promotor for seamless in vitro transcription reactions. The linearized plasmid template, using the Pme I restriction site, was introduced into the in vitro transcription reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1345). The selected in vitro transcription kit, mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 ULTRA Transcription Kit, was optimized to synthesize large amounts of efficiently and correctly capped mRNA, including a final poly(A) tailing step. The final mRNA product was subsequently isolated and purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1908), and stored at −80 °C until used for transfection reactions.4.15. NAP1L1 Transfection and Overexpression CD34+-derived MKs were transfected on day 12 of the culture and were placed on immobilized fibrinogen on day 14 to induce proplatelet formation. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ MessengerMAX™ Transfection Reagent per the manufacturer’s standard protocol. In brief, MKs on day 12 of the culture and differentiation course were used for the experiment. MesengerMAX reagent was diluted in Opti-MEM Medium (1:16.6). Next, mRNA master mixes were prepared by adding 1 µg of in vitro transcribed capped and poly(A)-tailed NAP1L1 mRNA, or its vehicle to 25 µL Opti-MEM Medium. The diluted mRNA was subsequently added to the dilute MessengerMAX, as prepared above, and incubated for 5 min. at room temperature. Transfection mixes were added to cells and incubated over night at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated overnight with LPS 100 ng/mL or its vehicle, lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 over-expression patterns.4.16. Proplatelet Formation Assay On day 13, the proplatelet forming (PPF) MK, defined as displaying at least one filamentous pseudopod, were scored by microscopy blinded as to experimental group, as previously described [17]. The percentage of PPF MK was calculated as the number of PPF MK compared to the total number of round cultured cells analyzed. An average of 200 cells were counted per condition.4.17. Statistical Analyses The mean ± SEM was determined for each variable. Student t-tests or ANOVA (where multiple groups were compared) was used to identify differences among two or multiple experimental groups, respectively (GraphPad Prism v9.1.0). If significant differences were found, Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used as recommended to determine the location of the difference (applicable for ANOVA). Basic science data were also examined for normality using Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Non-parametric distribution was detected for the data presented in Figure 5E, and data was analyzed using Mann–Whitney-U/Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. For all analyses, p-value < 0.05 was considered significant, and exact p-values are indicated for each figure.Acknowledgments We thank Chris K.

    "abstract": "Abstract The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Rodent models have played an integral role in the spaceflight program by permitting the collection of physiological data in support of human space exploration.1 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) to conduct the rodent spaceflight research on board the Space Shuttle and since its development, the AEM has been used successfully in over 26 rodent spaceflights2–10 with the latest one on STS-135 on 8 July 2011. Because rodent models for spaceflight missions have provided critical data in support of human space exploration, great efforts have been committed to continue the rodent flight payloads beyond the Space Shuttle era. When using the shuttle as the vehicle, the flight duration for AEM was expected to be <20 days. Now new flight payload scenarios have been developed which will require the AEM to be used with minimal modification to continue the rodent flight for 30 days with an additional margin of 5 days for flight preparation for other types of flight vehicles (e.g., Russian Bion-M free flyer). Potential operational limiting factors for the AEM, which could theoretically bar use for longer duration flights, have been outlined in previous publications11,12 and include the waste handling system, odor containing capability, and food and water supplies within the unit. With NASA’s growing push for longer duration crewed flights, there is also an increased importance placed on long-term studies of model organisms as a pre-requisite, despite existing outside the scope of the hardware originally designed for short duration travel. Therefore, a study of the durability of the hardware beyond the original design for short term Space Shuttle flights is required before application on the International Space Station and is the basis for this research, while also determining if other potential limiting factors exist when food and water can be replenished. Follow-up studies designed to test the AEM hardware life support functionality and durability are still needed beyond 35 days because these were outside of the scope of this initial investigation into the proof of concept as outlined by NASA headquarters’ science requirements (unpublished). On the basis of the food and water data from previous flight and ground studies (unpublished), the nutrient-upgraded rodent food bar (NuRFB) and water content in the unit is enough for 12 mice to reach the 35 day duration. Therefore, this study was designed to test whether the AEM, with minimal modifications, could be used for up to 35 days to support mice growth with a focus on the water handling system. Because external replenishment of NuRFB and water is easily administered to the AEM, it is outside of the current AEM hardware requirements to contain enough for a 35-day study with five rats, so we instead investigated whether the waste handling, air circulation, and lighting, and other hardware systems could support five rats for 35 days if the AEM were supplemented with the required food and water to determine which, if any, life support system existed as a limiting factor for use of the AEM for up to 35 days. These studies exist as important ground based controls in order to demonstrate the absence of a ‘cage effect’ due to the AEM when compared with vivarium-housed animals and to establish an AEM baseline in the observed parameters after containment for 35 days, although it is still recommended (and in most cases required and supported by NASA) to house spaceflight control animals in grounded AEM.",

    "results": "Results Mouse study The body mass measurements (Figure 1) were similar between the vivarium and AEM groups at both time-points during the tests. The average initial (day 0) animal body masses for vivarium and AEM groups were 19.0±0.5 g and 19.0±0.5 g respectively. At day 35, the average animal body weights for vivarium and AEM groups were 22.3±1.2 g (n=36) and 22.4±0.8 g (n=36), respectively. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The body mass of animals contained in the vivarium or AEM cage at each time point. No statistical difference due to cage (p>0.05).The NuRFB consumption among the vivarium controls and AEM-caged animals were similar (Figure 2). There was no significant difference between the average NuRFB consumption for mice in vivarium (3.55±0.06 g per mouse per day) and AEM (3.69±0.15 g per mouse per day). The average water consumption for mice in the vivarium (2.2±0.4 ml per animal per day) was lower than the average water consumption in the AEMs (4.2±0.1 ml per animal per day) by over 90% (Figure 3).

On a single occasion, the NH3 level in one of the AEM was measured as 8 p.p.m., but these readings were also well within the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m. The filters contained all animal waste throughout the test without any break in containment. All fans functioned normally throughout the test. The pressure gradient across the exhaust filter was measured throughout the experiment to provide an indication of airflow across the filter. Initial pressure gradient for all three AEMs was between 0.33 and 0.35 inches of water, and the pressure changed by no more than 0.02 inches of water over the duration of the test. This indicates that no significant airflow restriction developed due to occlusion of the filters by animal waste or food. Notably, on test day 20 of the AEM Test, NuRFB mounted on the food plates in one cage began detaching from the food plates, but the airflow across the filter did not change. Rat study The rat body mass measurements are shown in Figure 1. There were no statistical differences between the AEM and vivarium groups at the beginning (day 0), interim (day 21), or in the end (day 35) of the study. The average body weights (n=15) for rats in vivarium and AEM at day 0 were 275.8±11.4 g and 274.2±11.3 g, respectively, 384.0±34.4 g and 386.0±28.6 g, respectively, at day 21, and 425.6±41.7 g and 437.6±32.8 g, respectively, at day 35. The average daily food consumption is shown alongside the data of that of the mice in Figure 2 and we observed that the AEM values (32.0±0.8 g per rat per day) were higher than the average food consumption in the vivarium cage (25.2±0.3 g per rat per day) groups. A trend similar to the one observed in mice average water consumption is shown in Figure 3, where this parameter was also elevated in the AEMs (45.0±1.7 ml per rat per day) compared with the vivarium control (25.2±0.3 ml per rat per day). Immediately prior to euthanasia, blood samples were collected for a standard panel of clinical chemistry tests including quantification of blood glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine total protein. AEM and vivarium control group values were within the reference range or within 10% of the vivarium controls. Also, there was no significant difference in organ mass per gram total body mass of the thymus, adrenals, spleen, heart, or lungs between the AEM group and the vivarium controls (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab The observed change in organ mass to body mass ratio for VIV and AEM cages, normalized as fold change to mean of baseline (T0) group. Bars marked with *indicate a statistical difference (p>0.05).No mortalities or noticeable health problems occurred during the study. In the present study, gross morphological evaluations of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestines showed no signs of discoloration or gastric lesions suggestive of digestive problems or allergies during the study. In addition, CO2 concentration in the AEMs was <0.07% throughout the test (well within the acceptable limit of 0.7%) and ammonia (NH3) concentration was undetectable throughout the test (well below the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m.). With the rats occupying the AEM, the filters were again able to contain all waste without any break in containment throughout the experiment. Odors were barely detectable upon opening of the AEMs as determined by a group of untrained personnel who were asked to indicate the presence/absence, and acceptable range of any odor at day 21 when the food was replenished or at day 35 at the conclusion of the study. Again, all fans functioned normally throughout the test. Interior pressure dropped only slightly over the course of the test but the airflow did not appear to be impaired. Initial readings were between 0.32 inches of water and 0.34 inches of water for all AEMs, at day 21 the readings dropped by 0.02 inches of water in each AEM, and final readings at day 35 were between 0.25 inches of water and 0.28 inches of water.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Several organs were observed to have slight changes in mass, and the following discussion speculates on these potential variations. Although no further tests were conducted to validate these speculations, they are offered as areas of potential further study and as cautions to researchers which may utilize the AEM hardware in spaceflight experiments to study a particular organ system. The AEM unit induced a decreased organ mass (normalized to baseline and total body mass) in both kidneys (−4.8%) and adrenals of mice (−21.1%; Figure 4) after 35 days of habitation in the AEM. Enlargement of the kidneys is commonly associated clinically with increased water retention as a result of an obstruction of urine flow, such as by kidney stones. Speculatively, the observed decrease in kidney size could be a result of the observed increase in water consumption that eliminated blockages in the kidneys in the AEM mice, which consumed more water. The observed decrease in mouse adrenal mass can potentially be explained by a decrease in stress in the AEM cages that results in a decrease in cortisol production, a major function of the adrenals. Conversely, there was an observed increase in normalized mass of the mouse thymus (+28.8%) and spleen (+27.6%) as a result of habitation for 35 days in the AEM. Thymic involution, or the shrinking of the thymus with age, is consistent in almost all vertebrates,13 and was again observed in our study, although the shrinkage in relation to baseline size was diminished in AEM mice (−29.7% in vivarium versus −9.4% in AEM). Involution could have a major impact on the immune system’s ability to mount a strong response to new threats due to the decreased ability to produce naive T-cells. Thus, the AEM cage, which evidently prevents some degree of thymic involution, may be a benefit to the inhabitant’s immune system. This effect was lost with the rats, which although they showed the same trend as the mice, they were not statistically significant. Reported literature claims that enlarged thymus in humans shows negligible occurrences of significant thymic disease,14 so the mitigated thymic shrinkage when compared with vivarium controls after the 35 day stay in the AEM unit potentially demonstrates no significant impact on thymic health. Analysis of the mouse blood (Table 1), however, indicates that all analytes studied exist within the normal ranges within the blood provided by Charles River Laboratory, although there are minor signs of increased stress or infection in AEM mice when compared with vivarium controls, such as the 38% decreased absolute lymphocyte levels (lymphocytopenia), 35% increased monocyte composition (monocytosis), 79% decreased absolute basophil levels (basopenia), 43% decreased absolute eosinophil levels (eosinopenia), and 27% decreased absolute neutrophil count (neutropenia). Further blood analysis also illustrated several statistically significant, but too slight to be considered biologically relevant, differences in the AEM group such as a 6.8% elevation in hematocrit (HCT%), which could be a sign of minor dehydration or even slight chronic hypoxia, a 5.2% increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) commonly indicative of a slight vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, and a 2.2% decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and 7.8% decrease in its concentration (MCHC), which both could be indicative of minor iron deficiency.

Mouse blood analysis also showed statistically significant differences in the AEM compared to the vivarium animals for several parameters such as a 38.7% increase in cholesterol, which may be stress induced, a 16% decrease in alkaline phosphatase which may illustrate malnutrition or vitamin B12 deficiency, an 18.1% decrease in bicarbonate which could be a sign of increased fluid loss, and a 6.4% decrease in albumin to globulin ratio which may be indicative of a slight kidney disorder which removes more albumin than in the vivarium animals. The rat blood analysis (Table 2) also demonstrated a 5.4% decrease in hematocrit, a 3.4% increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, a 45% increase in monocytes, a 47% decrease in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), an 88% increase in total bilirubin, and 71% increase in direct bilirubin which may indicate liver problems due to increased hemolysis.

Further analysis is required to confirm or refute given causes and potential diagnoses above based on blood and organ results, and they are provided merely as a suggested explanation for future studies and to prepare researchers utilizing the AEM hardware on spaceflight projects for potential limitations in studies which focus on these organ systems. The reported values were within the normal physiological range reported for rats,15 so we conclude that although the AEM cage seemed to cause variations in several parameters, these fluctuations are not biologically significant and support the proof of concept for 35-day habitation in the AEM on a diet of the NuRFB, providing a basis for expanding the AEM hardware originally designed for short duration space Space Shuttle into 35-day missions aboard the International Space Station and other spaceflight vehicles. The nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for short-term (18 to 20 day) rodent spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight simulation experiments has been verified.16 However, the nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for use in longer spaceflight and on-ground studies has not been evaluated. The results obtained from the mouse study have demonstrated for the first time that the AEM with its current configurations can be used to house up to 12 female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days of extended operations without any observable system failures. In addition, data obtained from the rat study have demonstrated that AEM can provide proper life supports for up to 5 adult Sprague–Dawley male rats for 35 days if the food is replenished as needed throughout the experiment duration. This research provides NASA with an essential lessoned learned, namely that the limiting factor to 35 day housing of rats and mice within the AEM will be successful replenishment to food and water, as supported by the absence of any hardware failures in life support systems and the blood and organ analysis of subjects which fell within the normal ranges of animals not exposed to AEM cages. This opens the doors to similar ground based and flight missions of longer duration of up to 90 days, the desired range of the next generation of NASA long-term rodent studies aboard the International Space Station.",

Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.Introduction Rodent models have played an integral role in the spaceflight program by permitting the collection of physiological data in support of human space exploration.1 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) to conduct the rodent spaceflight research on board the Space Shuttle and since its development, the AEM has been used successfully in over 26 rodent spaceflights2–10 with the latest one on STS-135 on 8 July 2011. Because rodent models for spaceflight missions have provided critical data in support of human space exploration, great efforts have been committed to continue the rodent flight payloads beyond the Space Shuttle era. When using the shuttle as the vehicle, the flight duration for AEM was expected to be <20 days. Now new flight payload scenarios have been developed which will require the AEM to be used with minimal modification to continue the rodent flight for 30 days with an additional margin of 5 days for flight preparation for other types of flight vehicles (e.g., Russian Bion-M free flyer). Potential operational limiting factors for the AEM, which could theoretically bar use for longer duration flights, have been outlined in previous publications11,12 and include the waste handling system, odor containing capability, and food and water supplies within the unit. With NASA’s growing push for longer duration crewed flights, there is also an increased importance placed on long-term studies of model organisms as a pre-requisite, despite existing outside the scope of the hardware originally designed for short duration travel. Therefore, a study of the durability of the hardware beyond the original design for short term Space Shuttle flights is required before application on the International Space Station and is the basis for this research, while also determining if other potential limiting factors exist when food and water can be replenished. Follow-up studies designed to test the AEM hardware life support functionality and durability are still needed beyond 35 days because these were outside of the scope of this initial investigation into the proof of concept as outlined by NASA headquarters’ science requirements (unpublished). On the basis of the food and water data from previous flight and ground studies (unpublished), the nutrient-upgraded rodent food bar (NuRFB) and water content in the unit is enough for 12 mice to reach the 35 day duration. Therefore, this study was designed to test whether the AEM, with minimal modifications, could be used for up to 35 days to support mice growth with a focus on the water handling system. Because external replenishment of NuRFB and water is easily administered to the AEM, it is outside of the current AEM hardware requirements to contain enough for a 35-day study with five rats, so we instead investigated whether the waste handling, air circulation, and lighting, and other hardware systems could support five rats for 35 days if the AEM were supplemented with the required food and water to determine which, if any, life support system existed as a limiting factor for use of the AEM for up to 35 days. These studies exist as important ground based controls in order to demonstrate the absence of a ‘cage effect’ due to the AEM when compared with vivarium-housed animals and to establish an AEM baseline in the observed parameters after containment for 35 days, although it is still recommended (and in most cases required and supported by NASA) to house spaceflight control animals in grounded AEM.Results Mouse study The body mass measurements (Figure 1) were similar between the vivarium and AEM groups at both time-points during the tests. The average initial (day 0) animal body masses for vivarium and AEM groups were 19.0±0.5 g and 19.0±0.5 g respectively. At day 35, the average animal body weights for vivarium and AEM groups were 22.3±1.2 g (n=36) and 22.4±0.8 g (n=36), respectively. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The body mass of animals contained in the vivarium or AEM cage at each time point. No statistical difference due to cage (p>0.05).The NuRFB consumption among the vivarium controls and AEM-caged animals were similar (Figure 2). There was no significant difference between the average NuRFB consumption for mice in vivarium (3.55±0.06 g per mouse per day) and AEM (3.69±0.15 g per mouse per day). The average water consumption for mice in the vivarium (2.2±0.4 ml per animal per day) was lower than the average water consumption in the AEMs (4.2±0.1 ml per animal per day) by over 90% (Figure 3).

On a single occasion, the NH3 level in one of the AEM was measured as 8 p.p.m., but these readings were also well within the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m. The filters contained all animal waste throughout the test without any break in containment. All fans functioned normally throughout the test. The pressure gradient across the exhaust filter was measured throughout the experiment to provide an indication of airflow across the filter. Initial pressure gradient for all three AEMs was between 0.33 and 0.35 inches of water, and the pressure changed by no more than 0.02 inches of water over the duration of the test. This indicates that no significant airflow restriction developed due to occlusion of the filters by animal waste or food. Notably, on test day 20 of the AEM Test, NuRFB mounted on the food plates in one cage began detaching from the food plates, but the airflow across the filter did not change.Rat study The rat body mass measurements are shown in Figure 1. There were no statistical differences between the AEM and vivarium groups at the beginning (day 0), interim (day 21), or in the end (day 35) of the study. The average body weights (n=15) for rats in vivarium and AEM at day 0 were 275.8±11.4 g and 274.2±11.3 g, respectively, 384.0±34.4 g and 386.0±28.6 g, respectively, at day 21, and 425.6±41.7 g and 437.6±32.8 g, respectively, at day 35. The average daily food consumption is shown alongside the data of that of the mice in Figure 2 and we observed that the AEM values (32.0±0.8 g per rat per day) were higher than the average food consumption in the vivarium cage (25.2±0.3 g per rat per day) groups. A trend similar to the one observed in mice average water consumption is shown in Figure 3, where this parameter was also elevated in the AEMs (45.0±1.7 ml per rat per day) compared with the vivarium control (25.2±0.3 ml per rat per day). Immediately prior to euthanasia, blood samples were collected for a standard panel of clinical chemistry tests including quantification of blood glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine total protein. AEM and vivarium control group values were within the reference range or within 10% of the vivarium controls. Also, there was no significant difference in organ mass per gram total body mass of the thymus, adrenals, spleen, heart, or lungs between the AEM group and the vivarium controls (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab The observed change in organ mass to body mass ratio for VIV and AEM cages, normalized as fold change to mean of baseline (T0) group. Bars marked with *indicate a statistical difference (p>0.05).No mortalities or noticeable health problems occurred during the study. In the present study, gross morphological evaluations of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestines showed no signs of discoloration or gastric lesions suggestive of digestive problems or allergies during the study. In addition, CO2 concentration in the AEMs was <0.07% throughout the test (well within the acceptable limit of 0.7%) and ammonia (NH3) concentration was undetectable throughout the test (well below the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m.). With the rats occupying the AEM, the filters were again able to contain all waste without any break in containment throughout the experiment. Odors were barely detectable upon opening of the AEMs as determined by a group of untrained personnel who were asked to indicate the presence/absence, and acceptable range of any odor at day 21 when the food was replenished or at day 35 at the conclusion of the study. Again, all fans functioned normally throughout the test. Interior pressure dropped only slightly over the course of the test but the airflow did not appear to be impaired. Initial readings were between 0.32 inches of water and 0.34 inches of water for all AEMs, at day 21 the readings dropped by 0.02 inches of water in each AEM, and final readings at day 35 were between 0.25 inches of water and 0.28 inches of water.Discussion Several organs were observed to have slight changes in mass, and the following discussion speculates on these potential variations. Although no further tests were conducted to validate these speculations, they are offered as areas of potential further study and as cautions to researchers which may utilize the AEM hardware in spaceflight experiments to study a particular organ system. The AEM unit induced a decreased organ mass (normalized to baseline and total body mass) in both kidneys (−4.8%) and adrenals of mice (−21.1%; Figure 4) after 35 days of habitation in the AEM. Enlargement of the kidneys is commonly associated clinically with increased water retention as a result of an obstruction of urine flow, such as by kidney stones. Speculatively, the observed decrease in kidney size could be a result of the observed increase in water consumption that eliminated blockages in the kidneys in the AEM mice, which consumed more water. The observed decrease in mouse adrenal mass can potentially be explained by a decrease in stress in the AEM cages that results in a decrease in cortisol production, a major function of the adrenals. Conversely, there was an observed increase in normalized mass of the mouse thymus (+28.8%) and spleen (+27.6%) as a result of habitation for 35 days in the AEM. Thymic involution, or the shrinking of the thymus with age, is consistent in almost all vertebrates,13 and was again observed in our study, although the shrinkage in relation to baseline size was diminished in AEM mice (−29.7% in vivarium versus −9.4% in AEM). Involution could have a major impact on the immune system’s ability to mount a strong response to new threats due to the decreased ability to produce naive T-cells. Thus, the AEM cage, which evidently prevents some degree of thymic involution, may be a benefit to the inhabitant’s immune system. This effect was lost with the rats, which although they showed the same trend as the mice, they were not statistically significant. Reported literature claims that enlarged thymus in humans shows negligible occurrences of significant thymic disease,14 so the mitigated thymic shrinkage when compared with vivarium controls after the 35 day stay in the AEM unit potentially demonstrates no significant impact on thymic health. Analysis of the mouse blood (Table 1), however, indicates that all analytes studied exist within the normal ranges within the blood provided by Charles River Laboratory, although there are minor signs of increased stress or infection in AEM mice when compared with vivarium controls, such as the 38% decreased absolute lymphocyte levels (lymphocytopenia), 35% increased monocyte composition (monocytosis), 79% decreased absolute basophil levels (basopenia), 43% decreased absolute eosinophil levels (eosinopenia), and 27% decreased absolute neutrophil count (neutropenia). Further blood analysis also illustrated several statistically significant, but too slight to be considered biologically relevant, differences in the AEM group such as a 6.8% elevation in hematocrit (HCT%), which could be a sign of minor dehydration or even slight chronic hypoxia, a 5.2% increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) commonly indicative of a slight vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, and a 2.2% decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and 7.8% decrease in its concentration (MCHC), which both could be indicative of minor iron deficiency.

The rat blood analysis (Table 2) also demonstrated a 5.4% decrease in hematocrit, a 3.4% increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, a 45% increase in monocytes, a 47% decrease in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), an 88% increase in total bilirubin, and 71% increase in direct bilirubin which may indicate liver problems due to increased hemolysis. Also present were signs that may indicate a slight kidney disorder: a 14.5% increase in phosphate, the 2.4% increase in chloride, 8.1% decrease in potassium, a 1.6% increase in sodium, and a 9.7% increase in sodium/potassium ratio.

The reported values were within the normal physiological range reported for rats,15 so we conclude that although the AEM cage seemed to cause variations in several parameters, these fluctuations are not biologically significant and support the proof of concept for 35-day habitation in the AEM on a diet of the NuRFB, providing a basis for expanding the AEM hardware originally designed for short duration space Space Shuttle into 35-day missions aboard the International Space Station and other spaceflight vehicles. The nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for short-term (18 to 20 day) rodent spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight simulation experiments has been verified.16 However, the nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for use in longer spaceflight and on-ground studies has not been evaluated. The results obtained from the mouse study have demonstrated for the first time that the AEM with its current configurations can be used to house up to 12 female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days of extended operations without any observable system failures. In addition, data obtained from the rat study have demonstrated that AEM can provide proper life supports for up to 5 adult Sprague–Dawley male rats for 35 days if the food is replenished as needed throughout the experiment duration. This research provides NASA with an essential lessoned learned, namely that the limiting factor to 35 day housing of rats and mice within the AEM will be successful replenishment to food and water, as supported by the absence of any hardware failures in life support systems and the blood and organ analysis of subjects which fell within the normal ranges of animals not exposed to AEM cages. This opens the doors to similar ground based and flight missions of longer duration of up to 90 days, the desired range of the next generation of NASA long-term rodent studies aboard the International Space Station.Materials and methods AEM hardware Three ground government support equipment AEM units (Figure 5) were used for the feeding studies of rats and mice. AEM units were built according to flight configurations which, for mouse studies, delineates that each AEM is loaded with two water bags in the water box container with approximately 2 liters of heat-sterilized distilled water per bag. Water consumption was derived as a difference in the water bag mass before and after the test. Each AEM cage was fitted with a cage divider that provided two separate and equal compartments for mice. In each half of the AEM cage, two food plates were provided with one attached to the water box side, and one attached to the cage side. For the rat study, water was provided with two external graduated cylinders connected with plastic tubes through the water box to lixits. Control animals were handled and provided the same environment and provisions as flight configuration. Water consumption was recorded daily and fresh heat-sterilized water was added as needed. No divider was used in the cage for the rat study due to the size of the animals, therefore only five rats were housed in each AEM. Each AEM was instrumented with humidity (Vernier Software and Technology Type RH-BTA) and temperature probes (Vernier Software and Technology Type TMP-BHA) and a gas port for periodic sampling for ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). NH3 and CO2 were measured using appropriate Draeger tubes and calibrated SKC Personal Sampling Pumps (model 222). Pressure drops across the exhaust filter were also measured at the gas port using an inclined Dwyer manometer accurate to 0.1 inches of water. The temperature and room humidity data were logged using LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) software running on two laptop computers. The sensor to laptop connections used Vernier Software and Technology ‘SensorDAQ’ (Vernier Software & Technology, Beaverton, OR, USA) interfaces. During the test period, the AEMs were placed on vertical stands and covered with shrouds at all times except for daily health checks and any lighting was provided by the internal AEM light fixtures. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Schematic outlining the Animal Enclosure Module key features.Diets The NASA Type 12 NuRFB, the official approved rodent flight diet, were used for the reported studies and a detailed description of the NASA NuRFB has previously been reported.17–19 Diet requirements for the 35-day study were estimated based on the AEM flight payload preparation formula, which states that the average daily NuRFB and water consumption requirement are 4.0 g and 4.5 ml, respectively, per mouse per day, and 40 g and 50 ml per rat per day. In the shuttle flight payload operations, an additional 20% mass of NuRFB and water were loaded as waste allowance for both the mice and rats. In the mouse study, each AEM cage was fitted with a cage divider, providing two separate areas for the mice. In each half of the AEM cage, two food plates were provided: one attached to the water box and the other to the cage side. Each water box diet plate accommodated four pieces of NuRFB, and each cage diet plate accommodated five pieces of NuRFB, for a total of 9×Type 12 M NuRFB (20.32 cm×2.54 cm×3.05 cm) per half cage, or ~2.24 kg per half cage (4.48 kg per AEM). In the rat study no cage divider was utilized in the AEM and the remaining NuRFB on the food plates were replaced with new food plates on day 21.Animal study All procedures used in this study conformed to the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals20 and Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.21 The animal protocols for mouse and rat studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center prior to the experiments. For the mouse study, female C57BL/6 mice (~35 days old) were acquired from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) 4 weeks prior to the start of the test. Female C57BL/6 mice (body mass 15.2±0.8 g) were used in this study because they are a strain commonly used in the NASA flight experiments.2–10 For the rat portion of the study, male Sprague–Dawley rats aged 12 weeks (body weight 159±8.6 g) were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA). Young male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in the study because many spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight simulation studies have been conducted using young male rats and they are the strain likely to be used in future NASA rat flight experiments. At the NASA Ames Research Center Animal Care Facility, animals were housed in standard polypropylene ‘shoebox’-style cages in a room maintained at a temperature of 24±1 °C, relative humidity of 40–70% and lighting which allows for a 12 h light/dark cycle. The control animal lighting cycle in the vivarium cages was synchronized with the AEM hardware operations. Upon receipt, the animals were randomly assigned to groupings of six mice or five rats, housed in vivarium cages with microisolator tops, and provided distilled water via standard water bottles and sipper tubes. The animals were continued on the same food diet as at the vendor’s facility. After 3 days of acclimation, the animals were implanted subcutaneously with microchips (Biomedic Data Systems IMITM 1000, Biomedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE, USA) under anesthesia for identification purposes, a standard practice in AEM flight payload operations. Then, animals were provided distilled water via water bottles with stoppers fitted with AEM-like lixits that were refurbished prior to the test. The diet was transitioned slowly from the standard rodent diet over the course of 5 days until the animal diet consisted entirely of the NuRFB, at which point all animals were fed with only NuRFB until the end of the study. Water was provided ad libitum throughout the entire study duration. Diets were provided ad libitum throughout the entire study duration but removed overnight before the end of day 35 due to blood draw taken at time of tissue collection. In the mouse study, following a 10-day acclimation, female C57BL/6 mice at 9 weeks old were randomly assigned (n=36 per group) to AEM units or vivarium cages. There were no significant differences in the initial body masses of mice in vivarium (19.0±0.5 g) or AEM cages (19.0±0.5 g). In the rat study, following a 10-day acclimation, male Sprague–Dawley rats age 13–14 weeks old were randomly assigned (n=15 per group) to AEM units or vivarium cages with 5 rats per cage. There were no significant differences in the initial body weights of rats in vivarium (275.8±11.4 g) or AEM cages (274.2±11.3 g). The cages remained untouched during the course of the study, except for on day 21 when the AEM were opened, the NuRFB plates were removed and weighed, new NuRFB plates were added, and the animals were given a general health check-up by an on-site veterinarian while body mass measurements were recorded. Animal water consumption was measured daily for the rats, while animal body mass and food intake were measured at day 21 and at the end of the study (day 35). CO2 and NH3 measurements were recorded on test days 1, 16, 28, and 35. NASA Animal Care Facility staff and Science team personnel performed a daily visual animal health evaluation. The attending veterinarian performed a detailed individual animal check and health evaluation on all of the animals at animal receiving, animal load at test start (day 0), during NuRFB replenishment (day 21), and animal unload at test end (day 35).Organ mass measurements and serum clinical chemistry One day before the end of the study (day 34), the animals were fasted overnight and then on day 35 the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood was collected via cardiac puncture, and then the subjects were euthanized via isoflurane overdose paired with decapitation (rats) or cervical dislocation (mice). The kidneys, lungs, spleen, thymus, adrenals, and heart were dissected and mass measurements were recorded for each organ. For clinical chemistry measurements, blood was collected in vacutainer tubes and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Serum samples were stored on ice and shipped to IDEXX Veterinary Services, Inc (West Sacramento, CA, USA). Serum triglycerides, cholesterol, fasting glucose, globulin, creatine kinase, and bicarbonates were measured by colorimetric enzyme assays using an automated Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Olympus AU 400, Olympus America Inc, Center Valley, PA, USA). Colorimetric enzyme assays were also used to measure serum biomarkers of liver function of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and direct and total bilirubin. Biomarkers of renal function included the measurement of albumin, creatinine, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and chloride) also by colorimetric assays using the Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. A Hematology Analyzer (Bayer Advia 120, Global Medical Instruments, Ramsey, MN, USA) was also used to determine red blood cell count, mean red blood cell volume, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, percent lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, hematocrit, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin, and fibrinogen.Statistical analysis Animal body mass measurements, food consumption, water consumption, and organ mass data normalized to total body mass following euthanasia were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with JMP 7.0 software (JMP, Cary, NC, USA). For all tests, P<0.05 was considered significant. Values in all figures are expressed as mean±s.d. unless specified.Acknowledgments We would like to express our appreciation to Dr Joanne Blum and Danielle Galindo of the NASA Ames Animal Care Facility; Dr Kevin Sato, Dr Robert Bowman, and Dr Esther Hill for support in animal processing; and Vera Vizir, Karin Perkins, David Leskovsky, and Shahn Spratt for support in hardware, logistics, and science operations.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10144393/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Biofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general [1]. For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations [2]. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form [3], and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal [4]. One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell–surface and cell–cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development [5]. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion [6,7]. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material. Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts [8]. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on “piping and equipment behind the panels” [8]. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which “holes” on the insulation tape were observed [8]. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenum now called Penicillium rubens [9]) started growing on windows’ rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were “zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates” on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over “cold” material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as “white powder”, sometimes “the size of a football” [8]. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS), Penicillium has been the most isolated genus of fungi [10]. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity [11]. The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell–cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells [1,12], and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections [3]. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin [3], resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention [4] and translate into high mortality rates [3]. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections [4]. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections, [13], particularly among the immunocompromised [14], posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response [15] and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure [16,17]. Particularly, Penicillium rubens has been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals [18,19,20]. While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth–Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars [21]. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space [22,23,24,25], little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies [26,27,28]. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics of P. rubens biofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraft- and nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment [9] and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project [29,30,31]. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Test Matrix: Fungal Strain, Materials, and Experimental Organization Penicillium rubens ATCC® 28089™ was chosen given the genus ubiquity in space stations and this specific strain’s presence (and damage caused) in the Mir space station [8,11]. The experiment examined the effect of (i) gravity (microgravity on board ISS vs. 1 g control in our lab on Earth), (ii) incubation duration (10, 15, and 20 days), and (iii) material substratum (seven materials tested) on fungal biofilm morphology. As described in further detail in [9], the materials chosen (and why there were chosen) for this experiment were: Aluminum Alloy (Al6061), as it is used in spacecraft structures, thermal control, structures for electronic devices and panels, etc.; Stainless Steel 316 (SS316), as it is used in spacecraft environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) tanks and tubing (including for potable water), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) elements, and on Earth in surgical equipment and implants; Quartz, as it is used in spacecraft windows (at least one of them in the Mir space station damaged by P. rubens); Silicone, as it used in space in O-rings and on Earth in urological catheters, surgical incision drains, and respiratory devices; Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), as it is used in spacecraft structures, antennae, pressure vessels, brackets, fittings, etc., and on Earth in implants; Carbon fiber, as it is used in spacecraft aeroshells and other applications; MIT Nanograss, chosen to be interrogated as a potential solution to fungal biofilm formation in space. This was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is the substrate (nanoetched silicon wafer) described in the making of a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS) without the lubricant oil and treated to increase hydrophobicity [32]. For each of these materials except SS316, six replicates of each incubation time were launched to ISS to be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at the end of the incubation period (for the post-flight morphology studies presented in this manuscript). SS316 was set up similarly but had 12 replicates per incubation time to enable more in-depth morphology analyses. Additionally, all materials had seven replicates of per incubation time launched to the ISS to be preserved in RNAlater (except MIT’s Nanograss, which only had 6 replicates) for post-flight differential gene expression analyses (samples available through NASA’s space Biology Biospecimen Sharing Program). This yielded a total of 288 space samples. An equivalent set (288 samples) was prepared at the same time as the Earth control. Additionally, a time zero (t0) set of samples that included seven replicates per material was also prepared. 2.2. Pre-Launch Preparation The following describes the preparation of the Space Biofilms fungal samples prior to launch. Preparation of space and Earth control samples took place simultaneously at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), unless otherwise specified. 2.2.1. Fungal Strain One lyophilized vial of P. rubens was rehydrated with sterile water for 30 h, and then used to inoculate potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, Cat. 70139) plates. After incubation for eight days at 25 °C, the plates were flooded with 6 mL of 1X PBS (Sigma Cat. P4417) and colonies were gently rubbed with an inoculation loop to dislodge spores. The spore solution was then used to inoculate new PGA plates (working plates) in a 6 × 6 grid fashion. The working plates were six days old when used to inoculate the material coupons with spores (Section 2.2.5).2.2.2. Preparation of Syringes To provide a humid environment ideal for fungal growth, a couple of absorbent mats inside the flight hardware needed to be wet at the experiment’s start (once in microgravity) (described in more detail in Section 2.2.5). Additionally, the experiment’s termination for morphology samples consisted of fixation with 4% PFA, while for transcriptomic samples, of preservation in RNAlater. In preparation for these tasks, 3 mL syringes filled with 3 mL of sterile distilled water, and 5 mL syringes filled with 4 mL of 4% PFA (diluted with 1X PBS from 16% PFA, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA, Cat. 43368) or RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. R0901) were prepared ahead of time.2.2.3. Preparation of Risers Silicone risers (Saint Gobain, Courbevoie, France, Cat. D1069809) were shortened to 13 mm height at BioServe Space Technologies, bag washed with 1% Liquinox (m/v) solution (Alconox, White Plains, NY, USA, Cat. No. 16-000-126) in distilled water, rinsed with distilled water, dried at 100 °C, and autoclaved for 30 min at 121 °C (dry cycle) before plate assembly (Section 2.2.5). More details on why these were used and how they were implemented are given in Section 2.2.5.2.2.4. Preparation of Material Coupons The 1 cm2 material coupons (Table 1) were labeled and organized by plate ahead of time at BioServe Space Technologies (except Silicone, which was labeled after cleaning). When at EVMS, the labeled coupons were washed with 1% Liquinox by ultrasonic cleaning, rinsed with distilled water, and then dried at 100 °C. Silicone coupons were cleaned by bag wash, rinsed, dried, and subsequently labeled. MIT Nanograss coupons were not cleaned, as they were prepared in sterile conditions. Table 1.

Once completely dried, the coupons were submerged in sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma-Aldrich, P6685) for 30 min and allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature; this supplemented the surface with nutrients to promote fungal growth over the coupons. The next day, coupons were carefully handled (never touching the surface, only the edges) to stick the cardboard side of 1 cm2 pieces of double-sided tape (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat. No. 9731) to the bottom of the coupons (over the label). The clear side of the tape was then peeled in preparation for spore inoculation (Section 2.2.5).2.2.5. Inoculation of Spores and Sample Assembly into Hardware Each coupon was inoculated with fungal spores per the “dry conidia” method [33]. A 5 g weight (McMaster, Hamilton, ON, Canada, Cat. 1777T23) was stuck to the back of the coupon using double-sided tape and then gently placed face down on top of 6-day-old mold of P. rubens grown on PGA plates (Figure 1a,b). Each coupon was placed on a new unused area of the mold for exactly 10 s to transfer comparable amounts of spores (on average 777 spores/mm2, Appendix A) onto each coupon’s surface. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Inoculation of spores of P. rubens on material coupon surfaces. (a) Example of 6 × 6 grid of P. rubens 6-day-old mold on PGA plates, and (b) inoculation of mold spores with 5 g weight.One sterile riser was inserted in each well of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) 24-well plate (CellTreat, Pepperell, MA, USA, Cat. 229524) (Figure 2a). An inoculated coupon was then placed on top and adhered to the riser (Figure 2b) and secured in place by pressing gently on the corners. The plates contained 24 coupons placed in a random fashion (ISS and Earth equivalent plates matching) to reduce the effect of a possible humidity or oxygen gradient in the Plate Habitat (PHAB). To ensure the safety of the crew and the space station, a sterile and gas-permeable Breathe-Easy membrane (Sigma, Cat. Z380059) was placed over each plate (Figure 2c) to seal and contain the fungi and spores. The use of the silicone risers reduced the working volume in the well to 0.7 mL, rising the material coupon closer to the membrane, and minimizing the volume of fixative/preservative needed to terminate the experiment. This resulted in reduced crew time, launch mass, and volume. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Twenty-four-well plates with (a) silicone risers only, (b) placement of inoculated coupons over silicone risers, and with (c) silicone risers, samples, and membrane film.Four loaded plates (inside a bag) and a temperature and humidity recorder were housed in each of the spaceflight hardware: BioServe Space Technologies’ PHAB (Figure 3). The temperature and relative humidity (RH) recorder was used to determine whether the environment was similar between PHABs. The PHAB was used as the secondary containment for the samples as well as a tool to maintain humidity and promote fungal growth. Each PHAB was designated to a particular incubation time and gravitational condition; three were sent to the ISS (one corresponding to 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation), while three equivalent PHABs were kept on Earth as controls. Figure 3. Open in a new tab BioServe Space Technologies’ PHAB in Space Biofilms configuration. (a) Loaded PHAB. (b) Opened PHAB with four 24-well plates (stacked and inside a bag) being removed. (c) Inside view of the PHAB with water syringes, adsorbent mats, and HOBO in the bottom. Photo credit: BioServe and NASA.The assembled PHABs were transferred to cold stow (4 °C), where they remained at this temperature for pre-launch, launch, and ISS stowage until experiment activation. The reduction in temperature and the placement of plates inside a plastic bag to reduce gas permeability help prevent activation (fungal growth) until samples reach microgravity. Additionally, the PHABs were maintained oriented during pre-launch stowage and during launch so that the coupons were on top to minimize the risk of detachment from the risers.2.2.6. Sample Set t0 The t0 samples did not undergo any cold stowage, but were immediately activated after inoculation by transferring to 25 °C for 6 h to allow spores to adhere to the surface, then fixed with 4% PFA on Earth. The objective of including these samples was to determine if they showed a discrepancy in spore count between materials at the start of the experiment and to determine if later comparison across material type was valid, or a result of unequal inoculation. The 6-hour incubation was chosen to allow enough time for spore adherence to prevent spores from washing away during staining. 2.3. Experiment Performance—On ISS and on Earth The Earth controls were performed following the same timeline as the flight set, albeit with a 2-hour delayed start, described as step 3 in Figure 4 (asynchronous). This allowed the spaceflight session to conclude prior to start the equivalent on Earth. Therefore, the operations described in this section (Figure 4) pertain to both space and Earth control sets. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Concept of operations for the Fungal Space Biofilms experiment. LSG = Life Sciences Glovebox, SABL = BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory incubator on board ISS.The start of the experiment began at sample “activation” when samples were removed from cold stow (after ~12.5 days) and provided with high relative humidity (RH) (> 90%), oxygen availability (ISS’ atmosphere), warm temperature (25 °C), and darkness, rendering the ideal environment for fungal growth. To activate the samples, the PHABs were opened, the plastic bag around the four plates was removed, and the two pieces of absorbent mat (one on the lid and one on the floor of the PHAB) were wet with three water syringes (9 mL total of water per PHAB). Then, the plates were returned to the PHAB, and the PHAB was placed at 25 °C undisturbed for 10 d 2 h, 14 d 19 h, or 20 d 3.5 h. After the designated incubation period, the samples were “terminated” while in microgravity to fix the spaceflight morphology or preserve the spaceflight transcriptome. Termination of the experiment consisted of flooding the wells with either 4% PFA (morphology samples) or RNAlater (transcriptomic samples), and took place inside the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG). To terminate the samples, the Breathe-Easy membrane was pierced with a needle to inject enough fixative or preservative into each well. The punctured membranes were dried from the outside with sterile gauze, and sterile RNase-free sealing strips (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. Z707392) were placed over to seal the holes left by the needles. Terminated plates fixed with 4% PFA were stowed at 4 °C, and plates preserved with RNAlater at −95 °C on orbit; immediately upon receiving them back on Earth, they were stowed at 4 and −80 °C, respectively, to prevent sample degradation. 2.4. Post-Flight Biofilm Morphology Data Acquisition Upon return to Earth, the plates with the fixed coupons were maintained at 4 °C. When ready for morphology data acquisition, the coupons were transferred (without touching the coupon’s surface with the biofilm) into a new 24-well plate in batches of six or eight (space and Earth control of a respective coupon treated on the same session). Each coupon was stained with a mixture of 400 µL of Calcofluor White (Sigma-Aldrich, 18909-100ML-F), staining the chitin present in fungal cell walls, and 400 µL of Biofilm Ruby (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, F10318), marking proteins present in the extracellular matrix, for 30 min protected from light. Then, each coupon was gently dipped in distilled water four times to remove excess stain and glued onto a microscope slide. To prepare the slides for microscopy, 65 µL of VectaShield anti-fade hardening mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, H-1900) and a cover slip were gently placed on top of the coupon. The coupons then stayed protected from light for 2.5 h to allow the mounting medium to harden. 2.5. Image Acquisition Microscopy images were acquired with a Nikon A1 Confocal Microscope using the 40 × 0.6NA objective and the NIS Elements 5.21.03 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan) imaging software. Two emission filters were used: 425–475 nm for Calcofluor White and 500–550 nm for Biofilm Ruby, with a 405 nm and 561 nm laser, respectively. The 3D structure of the biofilm was captured using a z-stack (step size of 0.243–2.096, 30 slices minimum), and each coupon was imaged in one large field (2 × 2 fields of 302.35 µm × 302.35 µm each, for a total of 604.70 µm × 604.70 µm). The coupons were always imaged in the center to avoid potential user bias looking for a particular section of biofilm. 2.6. Qualitative Analysis After imaging the biofilms, a qualitative analysis was performed on all the sample images using the NIS Elements Viewer 5.21.00 software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The qualitative analysis consisted of describing the morphology of the biofilms to find differences and similarities of the biofilms, namely observations regarding structure and distribution, based on material surface, incubation time, and gravity condition. 2.7. Conversion from .nd2 Files to .tiff Files and Slicing of Images The images taken with the microscope were stored as .nd2 files, which is an incompatible format for quantitative analysis with COMSTAT2. Thus, all the images were converted to .tiff files using ImageJ v1.48 [34]. To this end, the nd2 file was opened in the ImageJ software and the two channels were merged, and then the composite was subsequently converted to RGB color, 8-bit, and finally .tiff file. The ImageJ plugin Slice Remover [35] was used to remove the slices of the image stacks that did not have any relevant biofilm information (i.e., underneath the bottom layer and over the topmost layer where no biofilm signal was recorded). This ensured the software would not yield incorrect biofilm data. 2.8. Quantitative Analysis and Quality Control For the analysis process, COMSTAT 2 software v2.1 [36,37,38] was used as a plugin in ImageJ. The images were converted into OME-Tiff files using the ImageJ macro “Convert to OME-Tiff” to ensure compatibility with COMSTAT 2. Each OME-Tiff file was analyzed using the following parameters: (i) automatic thresholding with Otsu’s Method, and (ii) no connected volume filtering. The measurements produced by the software were (a) biomass and (b) thickness distribution. A proxy for biomass, which will be referred to as biomass for the purpose of this investigation, is calculated in COMSTAT2 as the ratio of volume per unit area. Using the data for 0 µm thickness, we calculated the (c) surface area coverage of the biofilm. As a quality control step, each mask created by COMSTAT2 was compared with the original .nd2 files to check for resemblance between the two files. The images which were far off from the original image were re-analyzed with a manual threshold instead of automatic threshold. The biomass of each of the t0 samples was produced by COMSTAT2 using the same methodology. Thickness and surface area were not calculated as these samples only contained spores which could be stacked or clumped together, potentially leading to a false statistical significance when comparing amount of spores. Biomass was hence deemed the best parameter to examine for this set of samples as it takes into account the overall volume occupied by the spores. 2.9. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2 in RStudio (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021). The data obtained from the quantitative analysis were first tested for normality and homogeneity to determine if parametric or nonparametric statistical tests would be used. Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test and homogeneity was tested using Levene’s test. The data did not comply with the assumptions of normality and homogeneity (only a few subsets complied); therefore, nonparametric statistical tests were used. The Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the median values of biomass and surface area coverage of biofilms based on the gravity and incubation time per material as well as to compare the differences between materials. A significance level of 0.05 was used (p < 0.05).",

RH and Temperature Profiles The temperature and RH registered inside the PHABs (Figure 5) shows a successful increase in temperature and humidity to promote fungal growth. The average temperature of incubation (activation to termination) was 24.8 ± 2.4 °C and 25.6 ± 0.9 °C for ground and spaceflight samples, respectively. The RH during incubation was 96.6 ± 6.0% for all spaceflight samples, while for Earth PHABs, the humidity was less stable for some cases. The average humidity on the ground was 56.1 ± 9.6%, 91.9 ± 5.9%, and 48.4 ± 16.9% for 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation, respectively. Figure 5.

Carbon Fiber No significant differences in P. rubens biofilm mass and thickness were observed when comparing incubation time and gravity conditions on carbon fiber. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage between gravity conditions. When grown for 10 days, biofilms formed in space had 22.7% less surface area coverage compared to samples grown on Earth (p < 0.05). However, after 15 days of growth, the spaceflight samples had 37.8% more surface area coverage than the Earth controls (p < 0.05) (Figure 6). Figure 6.

Stainless Steel 316 There were no significant differences observed in P. rubens biofilm mass or thickness when compared throughout the gravity conditions and incubation times. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage under two comparisons. Biofilms formed on Earth showed differences between days 10 and 20, where the surface area coverage had an 85.8% decrease from day 10 to day 20 (p < 0.05), as seen in Figure 7a. Comparing between spaceflight and Earth, the only difference observed was on day 15, when the samples grown in space had a 30.7% increase in surface area coverage with respect to the 1 g controls (p < 0.05); such an increase in microgravity was also noticeable in the microscopy images (Figure 7b,c).

Quartz There were no significant differences observed in mass or surface area coverage when comparing incubation times and gravity conditions of P. rubens biofilms grown on quartz. Nevertheless, biofilm thickness after 20 days had an 88.5% decrease compared to 15 days of incubation time in space conditions (p < 0.05). When comparing the samples grown for 20 days, those grown in space had 58.8% less thickness compared to Earth samples (p < 0.05), shown in Figure 8. Figure 8.

Titanium Alloy The biofilm mass (Figure 9a) and thickness (Figure 9c), when grown for 20 days on Earth, showed a significant decrease compared to samples grown for 15 days with an 8% decrease in mass and a 52.8% decrease in thickness (p < 0.05). Such a biofilm reduction (mass and thickness) was not observed in microgravity between 15 and 20 days. Surface area coverage (Figure 9b) of samples grown for 10 days on Earth was 4.6 times higher than those grown for 20 days under the same conditions (p < 0.05). Significant changes between space and Earth samples were also observed in biofilm thickness. After 10 days of incubation, samples grown in space were 2.3 times thicker compared to samples on Earth (p < 0.05). A similar observation was seen in the samples after 20 days, with samples grown in space being 1.97 times thicker compared to samples on Earth (p < 0.05) (Figure 9c). Figure 9.

Effect of Surface Material on Earth After 15 days growing in Earth conditions (Figure 10), the biofilm surface area on silicone was 13% higher than the biofilm surface area on the Nanograss material (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in biofilm thickness and mass between materials. There were also no significant differences between materials in biofilm thickness, mass, and surface area for Earth samples grown for 10 and 20 days. Figure 10.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The primary aim of this investigation was to characterize P. rubens biofilm morphology on seven clinically or spaceflight relevant materials both in space and on Earth. All materials were susceptible to fungal biofilm formation, some more than others, regardless of the gravitational condition. The fungal samples had equivalent initial amounts of spores on all material substrates, as there were no significant differences in biomass after 6 h of incubation. Although the temperature was kept close to 25 °C during the incubation time across samples, and despite our efforts to provide a stable environment, the humidity presented significant variations. Specifically, the samples incubated for 10 and 20 days on Earth had RH of approximately half that of the rest of the conditions. Since each PHAB contained samples of all material coupons, this does not affect the comparisons across materials, but it could interfere with comparisons across incubation times and between gravitational regimes. 4.1. The Effect of Microgravity on Biofilm Growth One of the primary dependent variables examined was fungal biofilm formation in microgravity compared to Earth’s gravity. Three cases of significantly increased biofilm growth in microgravity were observed: Carbon Fiber at day 15 (surface area increase), Stainless Steel at day 15 (surface area increase), and Titanium Alloy at day 10 and day 20 (thickness increase). However, there were two cases that showed the contrary with significantly decreased biofilm growth in microgravity compared to Earth: Carbon Fiber at day 10 (surface area decrease) and Quartz at day 20 (thickness decrease). These two cases, where fungal biofilms on Earth grew better than in space, are of particular interest because those samples correspond to the conditions (Earth at 10 days and 20 days) that experienced fluctuations of humidity (Figure 5). The ideal RH for P. chrysogenum is 90%, and decreases in fungal growth below this RH have been observed [39]. Previous studies have shown that drops in humidity can immediately stop growth and cause the dehydration of P. rubens [40]. On occasion, the fungus is able to start growing again when the humidity increases, but other times, RH fluctuations (of as little as 3 h) can suppress growth permanently, so only new germination can occur [40]. Additionally, there is evidence that after being exposed to high humidity, P. rubens cannot restart growth following a desiccation event of RH below 75% [41]. Since the humidity fluctuations in Earth PHABs of 10 and 20 days lasted for days and the PHABs reached RH of 50% and below, we expected the fungal growth to be impaired for those samples. Hence, it is possible that if RH values would have been equivalent between flight and ground in the day 10 and 20 PHABs, even more biofilm growth could have been observed on Earth. Nevertheless, this would not change our relative observation presented here—likely except for Titanium Alloy at 20 days, results that may be an artifact of the RH challenges. Quartz at 20 days was an exception to this trend as an increase in biofilm formation was seen despite lower RH values. While we have no clear explanation as to why this occurred, a previous study classified P. chrysogenum (the previous species name for P. rubens) as xerotolerant, meaning it can undergo a complete life cycle at low RH values and is considered resistant to dry environments [42]. While this was not studied specifically in this investigation, how P. rubens survives in dry environments should be further examined. With that in mind, our results suggest mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth dependent on the material surface and without a clear trend in time. It is important to note the significant outlier in the Carbon Fiber 10-day sample grown on Earth and the effect of removing this outlier from the statistical test. When removed, the comparison between Earth and space sample groups is no longer significant; however, all of the other observed differences remain the same, which implies mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth. Despite the changes in biofilm growth in microgravity, no consistent visual trends in morphological shape (overall 3D structure) across gravity conditions were observed. Therefore, in our experiment, microgravity did not impact the fungal shape of the biofilm. The mechanisms behind the changes in fungal biofilm formation in microgravity are still unclear and need further investigation. One potential mechanism behind the changes observed in this investigation could lie in how different fungi sense gravity. The octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN) is the structural protein comprising the vacuolar protein crystals that the fungal family Mucorales uses to sense gravity [43]. While this protein does not exist in Penicillium species, other unknown gravity sensing proteins could be present. Research into how other fungal families, such as Penicillium, might be capable of sensing gravity is a crucial next step to understanding fungal biofilm growth in microgravity and the changes in biofilm formation observed in this study. 4.2. The Effect of Material Surface on Biofilm Growth After qualitative analysis of the fungal biofilms, no difference in biofilm shape was observed across materials (Appendix B). However, significant differences in mass, thickness, and surface area coverage of the biofilms between materials were identified. The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time (Appendix A), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge [44]. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores’ hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer in Aspergillus fumigatus, and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae [45,46,47]. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found in P. rubens (Accession No. AM920436.1) using ’s BLAST Tool, meaning that P. rubens could also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow the P. ruben spores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss. Other factors such as surface roughness and charge are likely at play in preventing biofilm growth on Nanograss [44]. In the majority of previous research, P. rubens biofilms have been grown on gypsum, and data on the effect of roughness and surface charge on P. rubens biofilm formation are not available. Additionally, data on the roughness and charge of the materials used in this investigation are not available as these properties are manufacturer- and sometimes batch-dependent. Future experiments should measure this material’s properties to examine the effect of different material charges and roughness on biofilm growth on hydrophobic materials. Due to the decreased biofilm formation on Nanograss, this material warrants further studies with varying conditions and strains to determine its full potential as an anti-microbial material. 4.3. The Effect of Incubation Time on Biofilm Growth A decrease in biofilm growth was observed as incubation time increased in three cases: Titanium Alloy Earth samples (mass and thickness decreased between day 15 and day 20 and surface area decreased between day 10 and day 20), Quartz space samples (thickness decrease between day 15 and day 20), and Stainless Steel Earth samples (surface area decrease between day 10 and day 20). Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die [48]. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume [49]. Furthermore, Candida albicans, another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population [50]. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts. Another possibility for the decrease in biofilm formation on day 20 due to depleted nutrients is the weakening of cell–cell and cell–surface adhesions. Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell–cell adhesion and cell–surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins [51]. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cell–surface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining. Further studies should be conducted to determine if the depleted resources decreased the strength of biofilm adherence. Altogether, the results show that microgravity does not have a strong effect on biofilm shape and morphology of P. rubens up to 20 days of incubation. Even in the few cases where there was increased biofilm formation in microgravity, this effect was not maintained in time. Additionally, due to the reduced fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth, Nanograss could be considered as a potential anti-microbial material for certain spacecraft equipment. The results presented in this manuscript can contribute to the efforts of fungal biofilm control in space, but long-term tests (>20 days) as well as complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are highly recommended, as microgravity effects were both material- and incubation-time-dependent.",

Copyright notice ID: 10144393 PMID: 37109532 Abstract Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

Introduction Biofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general [1]. For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations [2]. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form [3], and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal [4]. One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell–surface and cell–cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development [5]. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion [6,7]. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material. Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts [8]. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on “piping and equipment behind the panels” [8]. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which “holes” on the insulation tape were observed [8]. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenum now called Penicillium rubens [9]) started growing on windows’ rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were “zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates” on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over “cold” material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as “white powder”, sometimes “the size of a football” [8]. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS), Penicillium has been the most isolated genus of fungi [10]. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity [11]. The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell–cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells [1,12], and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections [3]. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin [3], resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention [4] and translate into high mortality rates [3]. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections [4]. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections, [13], particularly among the immunocompromised [14], posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response [15] and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure [16,17]. Particularly, Penicillium rubens has been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals [18,19,20]. While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth–Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars [21]. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space [22,23,24,25], little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies [26,27,28]. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics of P. rubens biofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraft- and nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment [9] and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project [29,30,31]. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Test Matrix: Fungal Strain, Materials, and Experimental Organization Penicillium rubens ATCC® 28089™ was chosen given the genus ubiquity in space stations and this specific strain’s presence (and damage caused) in the Mir space station [8,11]. The experiment examined the effect of (i) gravity (microgravity on board ISS vs. 1 g control in our lab on Earth), (ii) incubation duration (10, 15, and 20 days), and (iii) material substratum (seven materials tested) on fungal biofilm morphology. As described in further detail in [9], the materials chosen (and why there were chosen) for this experiment were: Aluminum Alloy (Al6061), as it is used in spacecraft structures, thermal control, structures for electronic devices and panels, etc.; Stainless Steel 316 (SS316), as it is used in spacecraft environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) tanks and tubing (including for potable water), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) elements, and on Earth in surgical equipment and implants; Quartz, as it is used in spacecraft windows (at least one of them in the Mir space station damaged by P. rubens); Silicone, as it used in space in O-rings and on Earth in urological catheters, surgical incision drains, and respiratory devices; Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), as it is used in spacecraft structures, antennae, pressure vessels, brackets, fittings, etc., and on Earth in implants; Carbon fiber, as it is used in spacecraft aeroshells and other applications; MIT Nanograss, chosen to be interrogated as a potential solution to fungal biofilm formation in space. This was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is the substrate (nanoetched silicon wafer) described in the making of a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS) without the lubricant oil and treated to increase hydrophobicity [32]. For each of these materials except SS316, six replicates of each incubation time were launched to ISS to be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at the end of the incubation period (for the post-flight morphology studies presented in this manuscript). SS316 was set up similarly but had 12 replicates per incubation time to enable more in-depth morphology analyses. Additionally, all materials had seven replicates of per incubation time launched to the ISS to be preserved in RNAlater (except MIT’s Nanograss, which only had 6 replicates) for post-flight differential gene expression analyses (samples available through NASA’s space Biology Biospecimen Sharing Program). This yielded a total of 288 space samples. An equivalent set (288 samples) was prepared at the same time as the Earth control. Additionally, a time zero (t0) set of samples that included seven replicates per material was also prepared.2.2. Pre-Launch Preparation The following describes the preparation of the Space Biofilms fungal samples prior to launch. Preparation of space and Earth control samples took place simultaneously at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), unless otherwise specified. 2.2.1. Fungal Strain One lyophilized vial of P. rubens was rehydrated with sterile water for 30 h, and then used to inoculate potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, Cat. 70139) plates. After incubation for eight days at 25 °C, the plates were flooded with 6 mL of 1X PBS (Sigma Cat. P4417) and colonies were gently rubbed with an inoculation loop to dislodge spores. The spore solution was then used to inoculate new PGA plates (working plates) in a 6 × 6 grid fashion. The working plates were six days old when used to inoculate the material coupons with spores (Section 2.2.5).2.2.2. Preparation of Syringes To provide a humid environment ideal for fungal growth, a couple of absorbent mats inside the flight hardware needed to be wet at the experiment’s start (once in microgravity) (described in more detail in Section 2.2.5). Additionally, the experiment’s termination for morphology samples consisted of fixation with 4% PFA, while for transcriptomic samples, of preservation in RNAlater. In preparation for these tasks, 3 mL syringes filled with 3 mL of sterile distilled water, and 5 mL syringes filled with 4 mL of 4% PFA (diluted with 1X PBS from 16% PFA, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA, Cat. 43368) or RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. R0901) were prepared ahead of time.2.2.3. Preparation of Risers Silicone risers (Saint Gobain, Courbevoie, France, Cat. D1069809) were shortened to 13 mm height at BioServe Space Technologies, bag washed with 1% Liquinox (m/v) solution (Alconox, White Plains, NY, USA, Cat. No. 16-000-126) in distilled water, rinsed with distilled water, dried at 100 °C, and autoclaved for 30 min at 121 °C (dry cycle) before plate assembly (Section 2.2.5). More details on why these were used and how they were implemented are given in Section 2.2.5.2.2.4. Preparation of Material Coupons The 1 cm2 material coupons (Table 1) were labeled and organized by plate ahead of time at BioServe Space Technologies (except Silicone, which was labeled after cleaning). When at EVMS, the labeled coupons were washed with 1% Liquinox by ultrasonic cleaning, rinsed with distilled water, and then dried at 100 °C. Silicone coupons were cleaned by bag wash, rinsed, dried, and subsequently labeled. MIT Nanograss coupons were not cleaned, as they were prepared in sterile conditions. Table 1.

Once completely dried, the coupons were submerged in sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma-Aldrich, P6685) for 30 min and allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature; this supplemented the surface with nutrients to promote fungal growth over the coupons. The next day, coupons were carefully handled (never touching the surface, only the edges) to stick the cardboard side of 1 cm2 pieces of double-sided tape (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat. No. 9731) to the bottom of the coupons (over the label). The clear side of the tape was then peeled in preparation for spore inoculation (Section 2.2.5).2.2.5. Inoculation of Spores and Sample Assembly into Hardware Each coupon was inoculated with fungal spores per the “dry conidia” method [33]. A 5 g weight (McMaster, Hamilton, ON, Canada, Cat. 1777T23) was stuck to the back of the coupon using double-sided tape and then gently placed face down on top of 6-day-old mold of P. rubens grown on PGA plates (Figure 1a,b). Each coupon was placed on a new unused area of the mold for exactly 10 s to transfer comparable amounts of spores (on average 777 spores/mm2, Appendix A) onto each coupon’s surface. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Inoculation of spores of P. rubens on material coupon surfaces. (a) Example of 6 × 6 grid of P. rubens 6-day-old mold on PGA plates, and (b) inoculation of mold spores with 5 g weight.One sterile riser was inserted in each well of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) 24-well plate (CellTreat, Pepperell, MA, USA, Cat. 229524) (Figure 2a). An inoculated coupon was then placed on top and adhered to the riser (Figure 2b) and secured in place by pressing gently on the corners. The plates contained 24 coupons placed in a random fashion (ISS and Earth equivalent plates matching) to reduce the effect of a possible humidity or oxygen gradient in the Plate Habitat (PHAB). To ensure the safety of the crew and the space station, a sterile and gas-permeable Breathe-Easy membrane (Sigma, Cat. Z380059) was placed over each plate (Figure 2c) to seal and contain the fungi and spores. The use of the silicone risers reduced the working volume in the well to 0.7 mL, rising the material coupon closer to the membrane, and minimizing the volume of fixative/preservative needed to terminate the experiment. This resulted in reduced crew time, launch mass, and volume. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Twenty-four-well plates with (a) silicone risers only, (b) placement of inoculated coupons over silicone risers, and with (c) silicone risers, samples, and membrane film.Four loaded plates (inside a bag) and a temperature and humidity recorder were housed in each of the spaceflight hardware: BioServe Space Technologies’ PHAB (Figure 3). The temperature and relative humidity (RH) recorder was used to determine whether the environment was similar between PHABs. The PHAB was used as the secondary containment for the samples as well as a tool to maintain humidity and promote fungal growth. Each PHAB was designated to a particular incubation time and gravitational condition; three were sent to the ISS (one corresponding to 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation), while three equivalent PHABs were kept on Earth as controls.

Photo credit: BioServe and NASA.The assembled PHABs were transferred to cold stow (4 °C), where they remained at this temperature for pre-launch, launch, and ISS stowage until experiment activation. The reduction in temperature and the placement of plates inside a plastic bag to reduce gas permeability help prevent activation (fungal growth) until samples reach microgravity. Additionally, the PHABs were maintained oriented during pre-launch stowage and during launch so that the coupons were on top to minimize the risk of detachment from the risers.2.2.6. Sample Set t0 The t0 samples did not undergo any cold stowage, but were immediately activated after inoculation by transferring to 25 °C for 6 h to allow spores to adhere to the surface, then fixed with 4% PFA on Earth. The objective of including these samples was to determine if they showed a discrepancy in spore count between materials at the start of the experiment and to determine if later comparison across material type was valid, or a result of unequal inoculation. The 6-hour incubation was chosen to allow enough time for spore adherence to prevent spores from washing away during staining.2.3. Experiment Performance—On ISS and on Earth The Earth controls were performed following the same timeline as the flight set, albeit with a 2-hour delayed start, described as step 3 in Figure 4 (asynchronous). This allowed the spaceflight session to conclude prior to start the equivalent on Earth. Therefore, the operations described in this section (Figure 4) pertain to both space and Earth control sets. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Concept of operations for the Fungal Space Biofilms experiment. LSG = Life Sciences Glovebox, SABL = BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory incubator on board ISS.The start of the experiment began at sample “activation” when samples were removed from cold stow (after ~12.5 days) and provided with high relative humidity (RH) (> 90%), oxygen availability (ISS’ atmosphere), warm temperature (25 °C), and darkness, rendering the ideal environment for fungal growth. To activate the samples, the PHABs were opened, the plastic bag around the four plates was removed, and the two pieces of absorbent mat (one on the lid and one on the floor of the PHAB) were wet with three water syringes (9 mL total of water per PHAB). Then, the plates were returned to the PHAB, and the PHAB was placed at 25 °C undisturbed for 10 d 2 h, 14 d 19 h, or 20 d 3.5 h. After the designated incubation period, the samples were “terminated” while in microgravity to fix the spaceflight morphology or preserve the spaceflight transcriptome. Termination of the experiment consisted of flooding the wells with either 4% PFA (morphology samples) or RNAlater (transcriptomic samples), and took place inside the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG). To terminate the samples, the Breathe-Easy membrane was pierced with a needle to inject enough fixative or preservative into each well. The punctured membranes were dried from the outside with sterile gauze, and sterile RNase-free sealing strips (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. Z707392) were placed over to seal the holes left by the needles. Terminated plates fixed with 4% PFA were stowed at 4 °C, and plates preserved with RNAlater at −95 °C on orbit; immediately upon receiving them back on Earth, they were stowed at 4 and −80 °C, respectively, to prevent sample degradation.2.4. Post-Flight Biofilm Morphology Data Acquisition Upon return to Earth, the plates with the fixed coupons were maintained at 4 °C. When ready for morphology data acquisition, the coupons were transferred (without touching the coupon’s surface with the biofilm) into a new 24-well plate in batches of six or eight (space and Earth control of a respective coupon treated on the same session). Each coupon was stained with a mixture of 400 µL of Calcofluor White (Sigma-Aldrich, 18909-100ML-F), staining the chitin present in fungal cell walls, and 400 µL of Biofilm Ruby (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, F10318), marking proteins present in the extracellular matrix, for 30 min protected from light. Then, each coupon was gently dipped in distilled water four times to remove excess stain and glued onto a microscope slide. To prepare the slides for microscopy, 65 µL of VectaShield anti-fade hardening mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, H-1900) and a cover slip were gently placed on top of the coupon. The coupons then stayed protected from light for 2.5 h to allow the mounting medium to harden. 2.5. Image Acquisition Microscopy images were acquired with a Nikon A1 Confocal Microscope using the 40 × 0.6NA objective and the NIS Elements 5.21.03 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan) imaging software. Two emission filters were used: 425–475 nm for Calcofluor White and 500–550 nm for Biofilm Ruby, with a 405 nm and 561 nm laser, respectively. The 3D structure of the biofilm was captured using a z-stack (step size of 0.243–2.096, 30 slices minimum), and each coupon was imaged in one large field (2 × 2 fields of 302.35 µm × 302.35 µm each, for a total of 604.70 µm × 604.70 µm). The coupons were always imaged in the center to avoid potential user bias looking for a particular section of biofilm.2.6. Qualitative Analysis After imaging the biofilms, a qualitative analysis was performed on all the sample images using the NIS Elements Viewer 5.21.00 software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The qualitative analysis consisted of describing the morphology of the biofilms to find differences and similarities of the biofilms, namely observations regarding structure and distribution, based on material surface, incubation time, and gravity condition.2.7. Conversion from .nd2 Files to .tiff Files and Slicing of Images The images taken with the microscope were stored as .nd2 files, which is an incompatible format for quantitative analysis with COMSTAT2. Thus, all the images were converted to .tiff files using ImageJ v1.48 [34]. To this end, the nd2 file was opened in the ImageJ software and the two channels were merged, and then the composite was subsequently converted to RGB color, 8-bit, and finally .tiff file. The ImageJ plugin Slice Remover [35] was used to remove the slices of the image stacks that did not have any relevant biofilm information (i.e., underneath the bottom layer and over the topmost layer where no biofilm signal was recorded). This ensured the software would not yield incorrect biofilm data.2.8. Quantitative Analysis and Quality Control For the analysis process, COMSTAT 2 software v2.1 [36,37,38] was used as a plugin in ImageJ. The images were converted into OME-Tiff files using the ImageJ macro “Convert to OME-Tiff” to ensure compatibility with COMSTAT 2. Each OME-Tiff file was analyzed using the following parameters: (i) automatic thresholding with Otsu’s Method, and (ii) no connected volume filtering. The measurements produced by the software were (a) biomass and (b) thickness distribution. A proxy for biomass, which will be referred to as biomass for the purpose of this investigation, is calculated in COMSTAT2 as the ratio of volume per unit area. Using the data for 0 µm thickness, we calculated the (c) surface area coverage of the biofilm. As a quality control step, each mask created by COMSTAT2 was compared with the original .nd2 files to check for resemblance between the two files. The images which were far off from the original image were re-analyzed with a manual threshold instead of automatic threshold. The biomass of each of the t0 samples was produced by COMSTAT2 using the same methodology. Thickness and surface area were not calculated as these samples only contained spores which could be stacked or clumped together, potentially leading to a false statistical significance when comparing amount of spores. Biomass was hence deemed the best parameter to examine for this set of samples as it takes into account the overall volume occupied by the spores.2.9. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2 in RStudio (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021). The data obtained from the quantitative analysis were first tested for normality and homogeneity to determine if parametric or nonparametric statistical tests would be used. Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test and homogeneity was tested using Levene’s test. The data did not comply with the assumptions of normality and homogeneity (only a few subsets complied); therefore, nonparametric statistical tests were used. The Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the median values of biomass and surface area coverage of biofilms based on the gravity and incubation time per material as well as to compare the differences between materials. A significance level of 0.05 was used (p < 0.05). 3. Results The results presented below in Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.7, Section 3.8 and Section 3.9 are all statistically significant results. Any comparisons that were not statistically significant are not reported. All figures with statistically significant results are indicated using brackets. Comparisons without brackets indicate a lack of statistically significant differences. 3.1. RH and Temperature Profiles The temperature and RH registered inside the PHABs (Figure 5) shows a successful increase in temperature and humidity to promote fungal growth. The average temperature of incubation (activation to termination) was 24.8 ± 2.4 °C and 25.6 ± 0.9 °C for ground and spaceflight samples, respectively. The RH during incubation was 96.6 ± 6.0% for all spaceflight samples, while for Earth PHABs, the humidity was less stable for some cases. The average humidity on the ground was 56.1 ± 9.6%, 91.9 ± 5.9%, and 48.4 ± 16.9% for 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation, respectively. Figure 5.

Carbon Fiber No significant differences in P. rubens biofilm mass and thickness were observed when comparing incubation time and gravity conditions on carbon fiber. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage between gravity conditions. When grown for 10 days, biofilms formed in space had 22.7% less surface area coverage compared to samples grown on Earth (p < 0.05). However, after 15 days of growth, the spaceflight samples had 37.8% more surface area coverage than the Earth controls (p < 0.05) (Figure 6). Figure 6.

Stainless Steel 316 There were no significant differences observed in P. rubens biofilm mass or thickness when compared throughout the gravity conditions and incubation times. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage under two comparisons. Biofilms formed on Earth showed differences between days 10 and 20, where the surface area coverage had an 85.8% decrease from day 10 to day 20 (p < 0.05), as seen in Figure 7a. Comparing between spaceflight and Earth, the only difference observed was on day 15, when the samples grown in space had a 30.7% increase in surface area coverage with respect to the 1 g controls (p < 0.05); such an increase in microgravity was also noticeable in the microscopy images (Figure 7b,c).

Quartz There were no significant differences observed in mass or surface area coverage when comparing incubation times and gravity conditions of P. rubens biofilms grown on quartz. Nevertheless, biofilm thickness after 20 days had an 88.5% decrease compared to 15 days of incubation time in space conditions (p < 0.05). When comparing the samples grown for 20 days, those grown in space had 58.8% less thickness compared to Earth samples (p < 0.05), shown in Figure 8. Figure 8.

Titanium Alloy The biofilm mass (Figure 9a) and thickness (Figure 9c), when grown for 20 days on Earth, showed a significant decrease compared to samples grown for 15 days with an 8% decrease in mass and a 52.8% decrease in thickness (p < 0.05). Such a biofilm reduction (mass and thickness) was not observed in microgravity between 15 and 20 days. Surface area coverage (Figure 9b) of samples grown for 10 days on Earth was 4.6 times higher than those grown for 20 days under the same conditions (p < 0.05). Significant changes between space and Earth samples were also observed in biofilm thickness. After 10 days of incubation, samples grown in space were 2.3 times thicker compared to samples on Earth (p < 0.05). A similar observation was seen in the samples after 20 days, with samples grown in space being 1.97 times thicker compared to samples on Earth (p < 0.05) (Figure 9c). Figure 9.

Effect of Surface Material on Earth After 15 days growing in Earth conditions (Figure 10), the biofilm surface area on silicone was 13% higher than the biofilm surface area on the Nanograss material (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in biofilm thickness and mass between materials. There were also no significant differences between materials in biofilm thickness, mass, and surface area for Earth samples grown for 10 and 20 days. Figure 10.

Space Samples after 15 Days Biofilm mass was significantly different between Nanograss and four other materials when grown in space for 15 days. Compared to the biofilm mass on Nanograss, 27-, 32-, and 30-fold increases in mass were observed on Stainless Steel, Quartz, and Titanium Alloy, respectively (p < 0.05) (Figure 12a). Stainless Steel and Titanium Alloy not only had more biofilm mass than Nanograss, but also had 5% (p < 0.01) and 4% (p < 0.05) more biofilm surface area coverage, respectively (Figure 12b). There were no significant differences in biofilm thickness when grown in space conditions for 15 days. Figure 12.

The nomenclature for the significant values is as follows: *: 0.01 < p < 0.05.4. Discussion The primary aim of this investigation was to characterize P. rubens biofilm morphology on seven clinically or spaceflight relevant materials both in space and on Earth. All materials were susceptible to fungal biofilm formation, some more than others, regardless of the gravitational condition. The fungal samples had equivalent initial amounts of spores on all material substrates, as there were no significant differences in biomass after 6 h of incubation. Although the temperature was kept close to 25 °C during the incubation time across samples, and despite our efforts to provide a stable environment, the humidity presented significant variations. Specifically, the samples incubated for 10 and 20 days on Earth had RH of approximately half that of the rest of the conditions. Since each PHAB contained samples of all material coupons, this does not affect the comparisons across materials, but it could interfere with comparisons across incubation times and between gravitational regimes. 4.1. The Effect of Microgravity on Biofilm Growth One of the primary dependent variables examined was fungal biofilm formation in microgravity compared to Earth’s gravity. Three cases of significantly increased biofilm growth in microgravity were observed: Carbon Fiber at day 15 (surface area increase), Stainless Steel at day 15 (surface area increase), and Titanium Alloy at day 10 and day 20 (thickness increase). However, there were two cases that showed the contrary with significantly decreased biofilm growth in microgravity compared to Earth: Carbon Fiber at day 10 (surface area decrease) and Quartz at day 20 (thickness decrease). These two cases, where fungal biofilms on Earth grew better than in space, are of particular interest because those samples correspond to the conditions (Earth at 10 days and 20 days) that experienced fluctuations of humidity (Figure 5). The ideal RH for P. chrysogenum is 90%, and decreases in fungal growth below this RH have been observed [39]. Previous studies have shown that drops in humidity can immediately stop growth and cause the dehydration of P. rubens [40]. On occasion, the fungus is able to start growing again when the humidity increases, but other times, RH fluctuations (of as little as 3 h) can suppress growth permanently, so only new germination can occur [40]. Additionally, there is evidence that after being exposed to high humidity, P. rubens cannot restart growth following a desiccation event of RH below 75% [41]. Since the humidity fluctuations in Earth PHABs of 10 and 20 days lasted for days and the PHABs reached RH of 50% and below, we expected the fungal growth to be impaired for those samples. Hence, it is possible that if RH values would have been equivalent between flight and ground in the day 10 and 20 PHABs, even more biofilm growth could have been observed on Earth. Nevertheless, this would not change our relative observation presented here—likely except for Titanium Alloy at 20 days, results that may be an artifact of the RH challenges. Quartz at 20 days was an exception to this trend as an increase in biofilm formation was seen despite lower RH values. While we have no clear explanation as to why this occurred, a previous study classified P. chrysogenum (the previous species name for P. rubens) as xerotolerant, meaning it can undergo a complete life cycle at low RH values and is considered resistant to dry environments [42]. While this was not studied specifically in this investigation, how P. rubens survives in dry environments should be further examined. With that in mind, our results suggest mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth dependent on the material surface and without a clear trend in time. It is important to note the significant outlier in the Carbon Fiber 10-day sample grown on Earth and the effect of removing this outlier from the statistical test. When removed, the comparison between Earth and space sample groups is no longer significant; however, all of the other observed differences remain the same, which implies mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth. Despite the changes in biofilm growth in microgravity, no consistent visual trends in morphological shape (overall 3D structure) across gravity conditions were observed. Therefore, in our experiment, microgravity did not impact the fungal shape of the biofilm. The mechanisms behind the changes in fungal biofilm formation in microgravity are still unclear and need further investigation. One potential mechanism behind the changes observed in this investigation could lie in how different fungi sense gravity. The octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN) is the structural protein comprising the vacuolar protein crystals that the fungal family Mucorales uses to sense gravity [43]. While this protein does not exist in Penicillium species, other unknown gravity sensing proteins could be present. Research into how other fungal families, such as Penicillium, might be capable of sensing gravity is a crucial next step to understanding fungal biofilm growth in microgravity and the changes in biofilm formation observed in this study.4.2. The Effect of Material Surface on Biofilm Growth After qualitative analysis of the fungal biofilms, no difference in biofilm shape was observed across materials (Appendix B). However, significant differences in mass, thickness, and surface area coverage of the biofilms between materials were identified. The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time (Appendix A), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge [44]. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores’ hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer in Aspergillus fumigatus, and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae [45,46,47]. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found in P. rubens (Accession No. AM920436.1) using ’s BLAST Tool, meaning that P. rubens could also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow the P. ruben spores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss. Other factors such as surface roughness and charge are likely at play in preventing biofilm growth on Nanograss [44]. In the majority of previous research, P. rubens biofilms have been grown on gypsum, and data on the effect of roughness and surface charge on P. rubens biofilm formation are not available. Additionally, data on the roughness and charge of the materials used in this investigation are not available as these properties are manufacturer- and sometimes batch-dependent. Future experiments should measure this material’s properties to examine the effect of different material charges and roughness on biofilm growth on hydrophobic materials. Due to the decreased biofilm formation on Nanograss, this material warrants further studies with varying conditions and strains to determine its full potential as an anti-microbial material.4.3. The Effect of Incubation Time on Biofilm Growth A decrease in biofilm growth was observed as incubation time increased in three cases: Titanium Alloy Earth samples (mass and thickness decreased between day 15 and day 20 and surface area decreased between day 10 and day 20), Quartz space samples (thickness decrease between day 15 and day 20), and Stainless Steel Earth samples (surface area decrease between day 10 and day 20). Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die [48]. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume [49]. Furthermore, Candida albicans, another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population [50]. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts. Another possibility for the decrease in biofilm formation on day 20 due to depleted nutrients is the weakening of cell–cell and cell–surface adhesions. Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell–cell adhesion and cell–surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins [51]. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cell–surface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining. Further studies should be conducted to determine if the depleted resources decreased the strength of biofilm adherence. Altogether, the results show that microgravity does not have a strong effect on biofilm shape and morphology of P. rubens up to 20 days of incubation. Even in the few cases where there was increased biofilm formation in microgravity, this effect was not maintained in time. Additionally, due to the reduced fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth, Nanograss could be considered as a potential anti-microbial material for certain spacecraft equipment. The results presented in this manuscript can contribute to the efforts of fungal biofilm control in space, but long-term tests (>20 days) as well as complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are highly recommended, as microgravity effects were both material- and incubation-time-dependent.Acknowledgments Thanks to BioServe Space Technologies for the constant support that ensured the success of this project; special thanks to Stefanie Countryman, Louis Stodieck, Maggie Kolicko, Jim Wright, Carla Hoehn, Shankini Doraisingam, Sheila Nielsen, Mark Rupert, Stuart Tozer, and Matt Velone.

Analysis of the adhered spores was performed using ImageJ and statistical comparisons between materials were performed with Dunn’s test. No statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between any material types for spore count after 6 h of incubation (Figure A1), with an overall median of 248 spores counted per field of view, or 777 spores/mm2.

Calcofluor White stain in blue binds to cellulose and chitin. The Biofilm Ruby stain in red binds to proteins of the biofilm’s extracellular matrix. Images were chosen due to their median amount of biomass, surface area, and thickness to avoid bias. It is important to mention that there were no clear patterns or trends in chitin–protein ratios and that differences portrayed in an image may be true only for that samples and not for the group as a whole. No significant differences in morphology shape were observed between time points and gravity condition. Figure A2.

    "title": "Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Mathematics and computing",
    "introduction": "Introduction Muscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight1,2. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset. It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump’s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2+ during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3. With respect to Ca2+ handling, recent work has shown that during spaceflight, Ca2+ uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types1. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca2+ reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca2+ handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, it is possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation. Machine learning (ML) methods are particularly effective in identifying patterns in complex biological data, particularly for discovering biomarkers in heterogeneous, high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets4. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML methods are also less prone to distribution-specific effects5, making them a promising alternative to classic systems biology. This is particularly important for space biological research, where small datasets are often combined to increase statistical power. In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been flown in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied to this scientific question before. When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainability/interpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks, are seen as “black boxes” due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance but rather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relationships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely overfit models when trained on HDLSS data6. With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice, developed by Abzu ApS7,8. Symbolic regression attempts to find the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features’ relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely to overfit. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for these computational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efficiently to find concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery9. We aimed to identify molecular drivers of spaceflight effects on muscle physiology using spaceflight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) with omics data found in GeneLab10,11 and Ca2+ reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)12. First, we trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of spaceflight and ground control mice using multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regression task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from spaceflight or ground control mice, a classification task. We then identified features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model’s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers that may provide mechanistic insight behind the spaceflight-induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.",
    "methods": "Methods RNA sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscles—female) For RNA-seq RR-1 data, we started with the raw count files available on OSDR from the GeneLab RNA-seq processing pipeline29. We filtered out lowly expressed genes with unreliable reads (i.e., we only kept genes that had at least 10 non-zero reads in at least 3 samples), resulting in a reduction of dimensionality from 55,536 genes to 15,848 genes for OSD-104 and 16,660 genes for OSD-105, with an overlap of 15,216 genes between the two datasets (Supplementary Fig. 5g). We then applied a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2 v1.34.030, which corrected for library size/sequencing depth and mitigated heteroskedasticity and skewed distributions. The mean-variance relationship and count distribution were checked post-normalization to confirm the effectiveness of preprocessing (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d, Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). Within- and across-group gene expression variance distributions show greater variance spread for the FLT samples than the GC samples (Supplementary Fig. 5a–f). Proteomics data (RR-1—TA muscle only—female) The proteomics data for OSD-105 was collected in two runs of TMT-labeled mass spectrometry with a bridge channel in each run consisting of a pooled sample of all FLT and GC samples31. To ensure values were comparable when combining the runs, we used the ratio of expression values for each sample relative to that of the corresponding bridge channel. After combining the data from the runs, we performed a log2 transformation of the expression values, filtered out proteins with too many missing values, and applied VST normalization, all using the DEP v1.16.0R package32. Again, the mean-variance relationship and distribution were checked (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). We then imputed missing data using K-nearest neighbor imputation, which did not significantly affect the distribution (Supplementary Fig. 4a, c). Finally, we removed any remaining batch effects between the two runs that were amplified through the preprocessing steps using methods from the limma v3.50.3R package, which are appropriate to apply on properly transformed proteomics data33. The removal of batch effects was confirmed using paired PCA plots of the top principal components (PCs) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, d). The preprocessed dataset contained 1786 proteins. Bisulfite sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscle—female) Raw bisulfite sequencing FASTQ files were processed using the Nextflow nf-core methylseq pipeline (v1.6.1), which uses the Bismark aligner for genome alignment and extracting methylation calls (Supplementary Fig. 2a)34,35. The processed data were filtered to only CpG-type methylated sites, as non-CpG methylation is usually restricted to a few specific cell types (e.g., pluripotent stem cells, glial cells, neurons) that are not as relevant in this context (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d)36. The methylation sites were then mapped to their corresponding genes. For each methylation site, we found the gene whose chromosomal range included the site. Methylation sites that didn’t fall into annotated gene regions were discarded, as the current study focuses on mechanistic relationships between coding features. We then calculated the percentage of CpG sites in each gene that was methylated (% methylation). There were 48,368 and 47,660 methylation features for OSD-104 and OSD-105, respectively, after preprocessing (distributions shown in Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). We experimented with using site-level methylation features instead of gene-level methylation features, but this resulted in severe overfitting of ML models. The remaining methylation features overlap with the majority of the genes measured in the RNA-seq datasets, although a majority of the methylation loci do not map to an RNA-seq gene (Supplementary Fig. 5g). In order to assess whether the loci with the highest percent methylation are related to the genes with the lowest expression, as would be expected mechanistically, we compared the top 10% methylated genes with the bottom 10% expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 5h). There is some limited overlap but less than would be expected considering the overlap of all genes and methylated loci. Calcium reuptake data (RR-1 SOL female, RR-9 TA male) Calcium reuptake data was acquired from OSDR dataset OSD-48837, which contains rates of Ca2+ uptake in the muscle homogenates measured in a 96-well plate using the Indo-1 Ca2+ fluorophore1. These values were collected as a time series, with the measurements of cytoplasmic calcium concentrations taken at multiple points in time during a period of muscle relaxation. For our analysis, we use the area under the curve (AUC) as a measurement of calcium reuptake change over time. A lower AUC value implies more efficient calcium reuptake. For this study, we did not have multi-omics and calcium uptake measurements from the same animals. Therefore, for comparing omics and calcium uptake data, we assigned calcium reuptake values to omics samples based on perturbation analysis to identify the optimal pairing (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. 8). It is well characterized that there are significant physiological and molecular differences between muscle samples from spaceflight and ground samples1,2. We inferred that this difference would be greater than within-group differences in mission, age, and sex and would allow us to identify the spaceflight effect relationship between omics features and calcium uptake. Specifically, the SOL calcium reuptake measurements were collected from age- and sex-matched mice from the same RR-1 cohort as the OSD-104 SOL omics data. There was no TA calcium reuptake measurement done in the RR-1 cohort; the OSD-488 dataset only had TA calcium reuptake measurements collected from 10-week-old male mice flown on the RR-9 mission. We, therefore, paired the TA muscles calcium reuptake from these 10-week-old male mice with the OSD-105 TA multi-omics data, which are from older females. Model hyperparameters The primary hyperparameters for QLattice (feyn package v3.0.2) were the number of epochs and the maximum complexity of the architectures. The number of epochs corresponded to the number of generations for the evolutionary search algorithm as a whole rather than the number of epochs of backpropagation for any individual model architecture being explored. We tried various values for the number of epochs between 10 and 100, but there were no significant differences in validation performance or feature rankings. The maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 4 (2 features and 2 functional interactions) for the SOL analysis since SOL data had two data types, and we were interested in modeling the interactions between the data types. Similarly, the maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 6 for the TA analysis. Statistical analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Enrichr implementation in the gseapy library (v0.10.4) in Python, using GO_Biological_Process_2021 as the background gene set. Boxplots were generated using seaborn (v0.11.2) in Python, with statistical annotations calculated using the statannotations package (v0.5.0) implementation of the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon two-sided test.

    "results": "Results Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by machine learning regression analysis Exposure to spaceflight has been previously reported to increase Ca2+ uptake in mouse TA muscles and decrease Ca2+ uptake in mouse SOL muscles1. We hypothesized that this phenotypic change can be further understood by examining the relationships between genes, proteins, and methylation markers. Therefore, we trained QLattice to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive of changes in calcium reuptake capacity, using multi-omics datasets from OSD-104 mouse SOL muscle and OSD-105 mouse TA muscle from female C57BL/6J mice flown at 16 weeks of age on the RR-1 mission. For each muscle type, multi-omics data were combined and subject to dimensionality reduction prior to QLattice training, and calcium reuptake levels were used as a target (see Methods and Supplementary Information). We matched RR-1 SOL multi-omics data with RR-1 SOL calcium data and RR-1 TA multi-omics data with RR-9 TA calcium data. In the latter case, note that RR-9 includes 10-week male mice while RR-1 includes 16-week female mice, but we hypothesized that the spaceflight muscle effect would be great enough to overcome these differences. More details are provided in the Methods and Supplementary Information. In the TA regression analysis reported here (Fig. 1), we used both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics data. We excluded the methylation data because including it reduced QLattice performance while producing very similar results (see Supplementary Information). The top two features predictive of Ca2+ uptake rate were Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins (Fig. 1b). Representative models containing Acyp1 and Rps7 are shown in Fig. 1a. These models consisted of bivariate Gaussian functions, bivariate multiply functions, and univariate tanh functions (see Supplementary Information for additional discussion of model architectures). Of the 27 models containing Rps7, 24 included a relationship with Acyp1, possibly indicating a biological interaction between the two features that could be tested in the future through laboratory studies. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of biological signaling involved in apoptosis, endocytosis, and protein localization (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1.

We focused on the top 13 features across all models by rank, all of which were RNA-seq features: Gm35576, Rspo3, Gpc4, Klhl31, Sox6, Auts2, Sobp, Mdga1, Aox1, Tle4, Klhl33, Eepd1, Rhbdl3, and Gm21955. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of biological signaling involved in cellular differentiation, synapse organization and assembly, and neuron migration (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2.

Figure 3 depicts the changes of expression level in FLT versus GC for some of these genes and their corresponding proteins (when measurements are available) in both muscle types. Many of the genes identified have been described in the literature as playing a role in muscle recovery and we focus our attention on these genes. Fig. 3. Gene/protein relationship with calcium reuptake in SOL and TA muscles and putative mechanism. Open in a new tab The expression levels of the top key genes identified by QLattice analysis and their corresponding protein levels are shown against the calcium reuptake AUC in both TA and SOL muscles flown in space (FLT) or from ground controls (GC). a QLattice key protein levels in TA. b QLattice key gene expression levels in TA. c QLattice key gene expression levels in SOL. d Putative mechanism based on the Acyp1 response, showing up in the majority of the models for TA muscle and e SOL muscle. f Calcium reuptake AUC in TA muscle. g Calcium reuptake AUC in SOL muscle. All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 < p ≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 < p ≤ 1.00e−02).In the case of TA muscle, Acyp1 protein was found in 89 models. Acyp1 has been shown to inhibit the activity of Ca2+ transporters in non-phospholamban-associated calcium-dependent ATPases, such as SERCA-1, which is predominantly found in fast-twitch muscle fibers, the dominant fiber type in the TA muscle13–15. In line with this, Acyp1 protein expression is negatively correlated with calcium reuptake in QLattice models for TA muscles (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that high levels of Acyp1 are associated with low calcium reuptake efficiency AUC. Consistent with previous studies1, FLT TA samples exhibit lower Acyp1 protein expression and improved calcium reuptake (Fig. 3a, e). Interestingly, Acyp1 gene expression in TA has a much greater spread across samples resulting in no significant difference between FLT and GC (Fig. 3b), possibly indicating a more reliable measurement from proteomics than RNA-seq. Furthermore, Acyp1 has been shown to enhance the activity of Ca2+ transporters in phospholamban-associated calcium-ATPases, including SERCA-2a, which is predominantly found in slow-twitch fibers, the dominant fiber type in SOL muscle. We examined whether this pattern is consistent in the OSD-104 SOL multi-omics data and discovered that Acyp1 gene expression was also downregulated in SOL FLT relative to GC (Fig. 3c), while calcium reuptake was impaired in SOL as previously reported1 (Fig. 3g). Note that QLattice was not trained to find this association for SOL muscle. Such a finding is, therefore, quite strong, suggesting a potential mechanism. The observed downregulation in Acyp1 could contribute to impairments in SERCA function found in the FLT SOL, as it is known that phospholamban is highly expressed in this muscle and is less expressed in fast glycolytic muscles. Taken together, these findings suggest that Acyp1 may play a mechanistic role in the dysregulation of calcium induced by spaceflight (Fig. 3d, f), but additional research is necessary to establish this relationship. The second key protein identified in TA muscle was Rps7. This gene is known to be downregulated by nitrosative stress16, which is related to impaired calcium reuptake1. Consistent with this, Rps7 is positively correlated with calcium reuptake capacity efficiency in the QLattice models (negatively associated with calcium reuptake AUC; Supplementary Fig. 9). This suggests a potential role for Rps7 in the calcium reuptake response to nitrosative stress. No nitrosative stress was reported in the TA samples from the original study1, suggesting that mechanisms possibly including Rps7 may have enhanced the calcium reuptake efficiency. Further studies would be required to establish these relationships. The QLattice analysis for SOL revealed a very distinct set of genes (Fig. 2b). This is, however, not surprising as only gene expression and methylation data were available. Several of these genes are already known for their relationship to calcium reuptake efficiency and muscle response to injury, and their levels are plotted for protein expression (when available) and gene expression in both TA and SOL muscle in Fig. 3a–c. Gpc4 is underexpressed in injury-activated muscle satellite cells17; similarly, Tle4 is normally underexpressed following muscle injury to allow myogenesis18. In our data, both Tle4 and Gpc4 were upregulated in mouse FLT SOL (Fig. 3a, b), which displayed impaired calcium reuptake vs. GC SOL (Fig. 3g). This may indicate that failure of proper Gpc4 and Tle4 downregulation may play a role in damaged calcium reuptake, possibly by lowering overall muscle quality. This is supported by previous RNA-seq data showing that genes involved with myogenesis and differentiation were downregulated in the FLT SOL from mice19. Alternatively, Tle4 expression is known to be triggered by calcium signaling20, so the observed Tle4 upregulation may instead be the result of increased cytoplasmic calcium levels due to impaired reuptake. Further, Rspo3 has been found to be one of the most upregulated genes after SOL training and is associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy21, and its knockout has shown to compromise myogenesis and myotube differentiation22. Similarly, mice lacking Klhl31 exhibit stunted skeletal muscle growth, centronuclear myopathy, and SR dilation23. In our data, both Rspo3 and Klhl31 are also upregulated in SOL FLT samples with lower calcium reuptake ability (Fig. 3c), possibly as a compensatory or adaptive mechanism to increased calcium levels due to decreased uptake24. Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by ML classification analysis We then hypothesized that there may be other molecular pathways affected by spaceflight in mouse muscle that could be identified through feature relationships in QLattice models. Therefore, we broadened the scope of our analysis to identify multi-omics features that were predictive of the FLT or GC groups rather than restricting to a single phenotype. We used QLattice to classify FLT samples from GC and assessed the resulting models and feature interactions. In the TA classification analysis, we used all 3 types of omics data: RNA-seq, proteomics, and methylation data (Fig. 4a–c). The top 11 features from this analysis included all 3 types of features: Trak2 (RNA-seq), Tle4 (RNA-seq), Tspan4 (RNA-seq), Actin (Proteomic), Gm22281 (Methylation), Sell (RNA-seq), Ech1 (Methylation), Fhod1 (RNA-seq), Egr2 (RNA-seq), Klhl21 (RNA-seq), and Lrp2bp (RNA-seq).

Interestingly, multiple pathways involved mitochondrial regulation, which has been previously identified as a molecular response to spaceflight in multiple tissues including muscle25. The pathway analysis also uncovered perturbation of actin and myosin structural regulation. The actin protein was the top proteomics feature found across QLattice models (Fig. 4b) and was upregulated in TA FLT samples (Fig. 5a). Actin is a key component in the myofibril bundles which generate muscle contractions after Ca2+ release and signaling26. Further, the top RNA-seq feature Trak2 is known to enable myosin binding activity for muscle contraction27. Trak2 is also involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, which plays an important role in muscle mass regeneration and myofibrillogenesis27. The Trak2 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly as a muscle regeneration mechanism in a weightless environment. Tle4, the second highest occurring RNA-seq feature across all QLattice models, acts as a corepressor regulating muscle cell differentiation18. The Tle4 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly due to the lack of a need for skeletal muscle growth in a weightless environment. Fig. 5. Expression levels of top proteins and genes identified by QLattice TA and SOL classification analysis and muscle weights. Open in a new tab a QLattice key protein levels in TA. b QLattice key gene levels in TA. c QLattice key gene levels in SOL. All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 < p ≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 < p ≤ 1.00e−02).Interestingly, both Trak2 and Tle4 displayed some co-occurrence with Actin. Out of the 20 models that Trak2 appeared in, 4 of them contained Actin, while out of the 14 models containing Tle4, 2 of them contained Actin. This may indicate a co-regulation network between Actin structural muscle activity and muscle mass regeneration and cell differentiation in response to spaceflight, which could be further investigated in laboratory studies. In the SOL classification analysis, RNA-seq gene features comprised 69 out of the 80 features across all resulting models (Fig. 6a–c). The top 9 recurrent features were Fam220a, Lrp4, Osgin2, Gm29686, Gm22281 (Methylation), Sema6c, Alpk3, Tmod1, and Bcam. For the most part, these features appeared in single-feature models related to the FLT/GC outcome by a linear, log, or inverse relationship. Of the 120 total models, 18 described relationships between 2 features. Interestingly, 11 of these were pairs of methylation and RNA-seq features, indicating a potential cooperative relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in spaceflight SOL muscle response.

    "discussion": "Discussion Here we report the identification of multi-omics biomarkers in mouse SOL or TA muscle that are predictive of change in calcium reuptake capacity during spaceflight or broadly predictive of molecular changes in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Our study is a key contribution to the field both in the identification of these biomarkers and in that we demonstrate the utility of ML methodology for biomarker discovery in space biology by using the QLattice symbolic regression method to characterize biomarker relationships to each other and to the predictive target. Instead of using the traditional systems biology approach, ML methods provide unbiased identification of potential candidates for biological mechanisms. Our study is also one of the first to analyze combined multi-omics and non-omics/phenotypic data from the NASA OSDR, leveraging the relational database structure, which allows for mapping samples across assays and missions. Appropriate regulation of muscular cytoplasmic calcium levels is key for several downstream calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Calcium reuptake is reportedly improved in TA muscle but impaired in SOL muscle, during spaceflight1, with limited understanding of the molecular signaling causing these phenotypic changes. Here, we report that enhanced Ca2+ uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca2+ uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, including Gpc4, Tle4, Rspo3, and Klhl31. The lower Ca2+ uptake in FLT SOL is also correlated with significant weight loss for the SOL muscle in the RR1 flight samples (t-test p-value < 0.05); whereas there is no significant change in weight for TA muscles (Table 1). Overall, the analysis provided here suggests that TA muscles are more resilient to space conditions, and Acyp1 and Rps7 seem to be good candidates to counteract weight losses and poor Ca2+ uptake observed in SOL muscles. Table 1. Average processed tissue weights for RR-1 SOL and TA groups. Condition Average weight (mg) RR-1 SOL FLT 7.9 GC 10.5 RR-1 TA FLT 13.3 GC 13.9 Open in a new tab On the technological aspect of this work, we show that one of the major advantages of QLattice compared to traditional multi-omics or differential gene expression analysis methods is its ability to elucidate a variety of mathematical interactions, not necessarily linear, between different multi-omics features. We noted a variety of mathematical functions in the QLattice models from our analysis, including bivariate Gaussian, bivariate multiply, univariate tanh, addition, multiplication, and log. The response plots provided by QLattice help translate the mathematical functions into biological and mechanistic interpretations (Supplementary Fig. 9). We noted that when Gaussian functions are reported, only the first half of the Gaussian curve is being used to fit a sigmoidal trend (Supplementary Fig. 9). Biologically, we interpret this to be because biological quantities (e.g., calcium concentration) cannot be negative, nor cannot exceed a certain threshold (e.g., the total amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Thus, linear models would actually fail to extrapolate in these more extreme ends of the quantity’s range, while sigmoidal models would fit much more accurately. To further improve the predictive capability of this tool, it would be valuable to further characterize the relationship between the mathematical functions identified by QLattice and the distribution of protein concentrations in various tissues. Such characteristics would help further translate the interactions of the various functions found in QLattice with an actual biological process between different key components of a tissue. While additional study is needed to fully characterize the relationships identified here by QLattice, we suggest that QLattice’s emphasis on concise, interpretable models makes it an especially appropriate ML methodology for research applications where explainability is key. Biomedical research, and especially space biology research, presents the additional challenge of small sample sizes, which usually leads to severe overfitting and a lack of generalizability in the models found by conventional ML algorithms. This issue is at least partially addressed by QLattice’s predisposition to limit the architectural complexity of models (which has a strong regularizing effect), as well as its heavy intrinsic feature selection based on mutual information with the target variable. A valuable future study would be to characterize the relationship between the individual data modalities and the overall multi-omics results. As demonstrated in this study, when an ML method properly accounts for these challenges and priorities specific to space biology research, it can provide significant guidance for what to focus on in future research. Although the top biomarkers from QLattice must be further characterized and confirmed, the method has appreciably narrowed the research “search space” by directing us toward groups of biomarkers that are most promising. In this way, explainable and interpretable ML, with its advantage over humans in being able to process huge feature spaces, serves as a metaphorical “metal detector,” telling us where we should start digging. The results we report here would benefit from future experimental validation studies. We conclude with our observations on the contributions of the different types of omics data to the QLattice predictive models. In this work, DNA methylation CpG+ features, when mapped to gene names or when maintained as genomic coordinates, failed to greatly contribute to model architectures and resulted in lower predictive performance. We suggest that this may be because methylation marks are deposited over time, so molecular changes during spaceflight are primarily dominated by functional changes, while small but persistent epigenetic changes may be better captured upon return to earth. To test this hypothesis, future studies could capture methylation measurements both before and after spaceflight from the same animals. In accordance with this hypothesis, both protein and gene expression changes were the most predictive features, with the top proteomic features much stronger and more cohesive than those of top RNA-seq features. This may constitute support in favor of focusing on proteomic analysis over RNA-seq analysis in future spaceflight studies, as the relationship between proteins and function is more immediate compared to the presumably noisier relationship between transcripts and function. Taken together, our results build on previous work in the field by reporting a promising demonstration of an explainable ML method for space biology research and providing several potential biomarkers for future study on muscle response to spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 10719374 PMID: 38092777 Abstract The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Mathematics and computingIntroduction Muscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight1,2. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset. It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump’s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2+ during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3. With respect to Ca2+ handling, recent work has shown that during spaceflight, Ca2+ uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types1. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca2+ reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca2+ handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, it is possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation. Machine learning (ML) methods are particularly effective in identifying patterns in complex biological data, particularly for discovering biomarkers in heterogeneous, high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets4. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML methods are also less prone to distribution-specific effects5, making them a promising alternative to classic systems biology. This is particularly important for space biological research, where small datasets are often combined to increase statistical power. In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been flown in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied to this scientific question before. When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainability/interpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks, are seen as “black boxes” due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance but rather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relationships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely overfit models when trained on HDLSS data6. With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice, developed by Abzu ApS7,8. Symbolic regression attempts to find the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features’ relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely to overfit. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for these computational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efficiently to find concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery9. We aimed to identify molecular drivers of spaceflight effects on muscle physiology using spaceflight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) with omics data found in GeneLab10,11 and Ca2+ reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)12. First, we trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of spaceflight and ground control mice using multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regression task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from spaceflight or ground control mice, a classification task. We then identified features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model’s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers that may provide mechanistic insight behind the spaceflight-induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.Results Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by machine learning regression analysis Exposure to spaceflight has been previously reported to increase Ca2+ uptake in mouse TA muscles and decrease Ca2+ uptake in mouse SOL muscles1. We hypothesized that this phenotypic change can be further understood by examining the relationships between genes, proteins, and methylation markers. Therefore, we trained QLattice to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive of changes in calcium reuptake capacity, using multi-omics datasets from OSD-104 mouse SOL muscle and OSD-105 mouse TA muscle from female C57BL/6J mice flown at 16 weeks of age on the RR-1 mission. For each muscle type, multi-omics data were combined and subject to dimensionality reduction prior to QLattice training, and calcium reuptake levels were used as a target (see Methods and Supplementary Information). We matched RR-1 SOL multi-omics data with RR-1 SOL calcium data and RR-1 TA multi-omics data with RR-9 TA calcium data. In the latter case, note that RR-9 includes 10-week male mice while RR-1 includes 16-week female mice, but we hypothesized that the spaceflight muscle effect would be great enough to overcome these differences. More details are provided in the Methods and Supplementary Information. In the TA regression analysis reported here (Fig. 1), we used both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics data. We excluded the methylation data because including it reduced QLattice performance while producing very similar results (see Supplementary Information). The top two features predictive of Ca2+ uptake rate were Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins (Fig. 1b). Representative models containing Acyp1 and Rps7 are shown in Fig. 1a. These models consisted of bivariate Gaussian functions, bivariate multiply functions, and univariate tanh functions (see Supplementary Information for additional discussion of model architectures). Of the 27 models containing Rps7, 24 included a relationship with Acyp1, possibly indicating a biological interaction between the two features that could be tested in the future through laboratory studies. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of biological signaling involved in apoptosis, endocytosis, and protein localization (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1.

We focused on the top 13 features across all models by rank, all of which were RNA-seq features: Gm35576, Rspo3, Gpc4, Klhl31, Sox6, Auts2, Sobp, Mdga1, Aox1, Tle4, Klhl33, Eepd1, Rhbdl3, and Gm21955. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of biological signaling involved in cellular differentiation, synapse organization and assembly, and neuron migration (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2.

Figure 3 depicts the changes of expression level in FLT versus GC for some of these genes and their corresponding proteins (when measurements are available) in both muscle types. Many of the genes identified have been described in the literature as playing a role in muscle recovery and we focus our attention on these genes. Fig. 3. Gene/protein relationship with calcium reuptake in SOL and TA muscles and putative mechanism. Open in a new tab The expression levels of the top key genes identified by QLattice analysis and their corresponding protein levels are shown against the calcium reuptake AUC in both TA and SOL muscles flown in space (FLT) or from ground controls (GC). a QLattice key protein levels in TA. b QLattice key gene expression levels in TA. c QLattice key gene expression levels in SOL. d Putative mechanism based on the Acyp1 response, showing up in the majority of the models for TA muscle and e SOL muscle. f Calcium reuptake AUC in TA muscle. g Calcium reuptake AUC in SOL muscle. All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 < p ≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 < p ≤ 1.00e−02).In the case of TA muscle, Acyp1 protein was found in 89 models. Acyp1 has been shown to inhibit the activity of Ca2+ transporters in non-phospholamban-associated calcium-dependent ATPases, such as SERCA-1, which is predominantly found in fast-twitch muscle fibers, the dominant fiber type in the TA muscle13–15. In line with this, Acyp1 protein expression is negatively correlated with calcium reuptake in QLattice models for TA muscles (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that high levels of Acyp1 are associated with low calcium reuptake efficiency AUC. Consistent with previous studies1, FLT TA samples exhibit lower Acyp1 protein expression and improved calcium reuptake (Fig. 3a, e). Interestingly, Acyp1 gene expression in TA has a much greater spread across samples resulting in no significant difference between FLT and GC (Fig. 3b), possibly indicating a more reliable measurement from proteomics than RNA-seq. Furthermore, Acyp1 has been shown to enhance the activity of Ca2+ transporters in phospholamban-associated calcium-ATPases, including SERCA-2a, which is predominantly found in slow-twitch fibers, the dominant fiber type in SOL muscle. We examined whether this pattern is consistent in the OSD-104 SOL multi-omics data and discovered that Acyp1 gene expression was also downregulated in SOL FLT relative to GC (Fig. 3c), while calcium reuptake was impaired in SOL as previously reported1 (Fig. 3g). Note that QLattice was not trained to find this association for SOL muscle. Such a finding is, therefore, quite strong, suggesting a potential mechanism. The observed downregulation in Acyp1 could contribute to impairments in SERCA function found in the FLT SOL, as it is known that phospholamban is highly expressed in this muscle and is less expressed in fast glycolytic muscles. Taken together, these findings suggest that Acyp1 may play a mechanistic role in the dysregulation of calcium induced by spaceflight (Fig. 3d, f), but additional research is necessary to establish this relationship. The second key protein identified in TA muscle was Rps7. This gene is known to be downregulated by nitrosative stress16, which is related to impaired calcium reuptake1. Consistent with this, Rps7 is positively correlated with calcium reuptake capacity efficiency in the QLattice models (negatively associated with calcium reuptake AUC; Supplementary Fig. 9). This suggests a potential role for Rps7 in the calcium reuptake response to nitrosative stress. No nitrosative stress was reported in the TA samples from the original study1, suggesting that mechanisms possibly including Rps7 may have enhanced the calcium reuptake efficiency. Further studies would be required to establish these relationships. The QLattice analysis for SOL revealed a very distinct set of genes (Fig. 2b). This is, however, not surprising as only gene expression and methylation data were available. Several of these genes are already known for their relationship to calcium reuptake efficiency and muscle response to injury, and their levels are plotted for protein expression (when available) and gene expression in both TA and SOL muscle in Fig. 3a–c. Gpc4 is underexpressed in injury-activated muscle satellite cells17; similarly, Tle4 is normally underexpressed following muscle injury to allow myogenesis18. In our data, both Tle4 and Gpc4 were upregulated in mouse FLT SOL (Fig. 3a, b), which displayed impaired calcium reuptake vs. GC SOL (Fig. 3g). This may indicate that failure of proper Gpc4 and Tle4 downregulation may play a role in damaged calcium reuptake, possibly by lowering overall muscle quality. This is supported by previous RNA-seq data showing that genes involved with myogenesis and differentiation were downregulated in the FLT SOL from mice19. Alternatively, Tle4 expression is known to be triggered by calcium signaling20, so the observed Tle4 upregulation may instead be the result of increased cytoplasmic calcium levels due to impaired reuptake. Further, Rspo3 has been found to be one of the most upregulated genes after SOL training and is associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy21, and its knockout has shown to compromise myogenesis and myotube differentiation22. Similarly, mice lacking Klhl31 exhibit stunted skeletal muscle growth, centronuclear myopathy, and SR dilation23. In our data, both Rspo3 and Klhl31 are also upregulated in SOL FLT samples with lower calcium reuptake ability (Fig. 3c), possibly as a compensatory or adaptive mechanism to increased calcium levels due to decreased uptake24.Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by ML classification analysis We then hypothesized that there may be other molecular pathways affected by spaceflight in mouse muscle that could be identified through feature relationships in QLattice models. Therefore, we broadened the scope of our analysis to identify multi-omics features that were predictive of the FLT or GC groups rather than restricting to a single phenotype. We used QLattice to classify FLT samples from GC and assessed the resulting models and feature interactions. In the TA classification analysis, we used all 3 types of omics data: RNA-seq, proteomics, and methylation data (Fig. 4a–c). The top 11 features from this analysis included all 3 types of features: Trak2 (RNA-seq), Tle4 (RNA-seq), Tspan4 (RNA-seq), Actin (Proteomic), Gm22281 (Methylation), Sell (RNA-seq), Ech1 (Methylation), Fhod1 (RNA-seq), Egr2 (RNA-seq), Klhl21 (RNA-seq), and Lrp2bp (RNA-seq).

Interestingly, multiple pathways involved mitochondrial regulation, which has been previously identified as a molecular response to spaceflight in multiple tissues including muscle25. The pathway analysis also uncovered perturbation of actin and myosin structural regulation. The actin protein was the top proteomics feature found across QLattice models (Fig. 4b) and was upregulated in TA FLT samples (Fig. 5a). Actin is a key component in the myofibril bundles which generate muscle contractions after Ca2+ release and signaling26. Further, the top RNA-seq feature Trak2 is known to enable myosin binding activity for muscle contraction27. Trak2 is also involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, which plays an important role in muscle mass regeneration and myofibrillogenesis27. The Trak2 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly as a muscle regeneration mechanism in a weightless environment. Tle4, the second highest occurring RNA-seq feature across all QLattice models, acts as a corepressor regulating muscle cell differentiation18. The Tle4 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly due to the lack of a need for skeletal muscle growth in a weightless environment. Fig. 5. Expression levels of top proteins and genes identified by QLattice TA and SOL classification analysis and muscle weights. Open in a new tab a QLattice key protein levels in TA. b QLattice key gene levels in TA. c QLattice key gene levels in SOL. All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 < p ≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 < p ≤ 1.00e−02).Interestingly, both Trak2 and Tle4 displayed some co-occurrence with Actin. Out of the 20 models that Trak2 appeared in, 4 of them contained Actin, while out of the 14 models containing Tle4, 2 of them contained Actin. This may indicate a co-regulation network between Actin structural muscle activity and muscle mass regeneration and cell differentiation in response to spaceflight, which could be further investigated in laboratory studies. In the SOL classification analysis, RNA-seq gene features comprised 69 out of the 80 features across all resulting models (Fig. 6a–c). The top 9 recurrent features were Fam220a, Lrp4, Osgin2, Gm29686, Gm22281 (Methylation), Sema6c, Alpk3, Tmod1, and Bcam. For the most part, these features appeared in single-feature models related to the FLT/GC outcome by a linear, log, or inverse relationship. Of the 120 total models, 18 described relationships between 2 features. Interestingly, 11 of these were pairs of methylation and RNA-seq features, indicating a potential cooperative relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in spaceflight SOL muscle response.

Gene set enrichment analysis of the top 11 features revealed enrichment of pre- and post-synaptic membrane assembly and organization (Fig. 6d), in keeping with previous research showing structural alterations in muscle synaptic organization in spaceflight28.Discussion Here we report the identification of multi-omics biomarkers in mouse SOL or TA muscle that are predictive of change in calcium reuptake capacity during spaceflight or broadly predictive of molecular changes in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Our study is a key contribution to the field both in the identification of these biomarkers and in that we demonstrate the utility of ML methodology for biomarker discovery in space biology by using the QLattice symbolic regression method to characterize biomarker relationships to each other and to the predictive target. Instead of using the traditional systems biology approach, ML methods provide unbiased identification of potential candidates for biological mechanisms. Our study is also one of the first to analyze combined multi-omics and non-omics/phenotypic data from the NASA OSDR, leveraging the relational database structure, which allows for mapping samples across assays and missions. Appropriate regulation of muscular cytoplasmic calcium levels is key for several downstream calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Calcium reuptake is reportedly improved in TA muscle but impaired in SOL muscle, during spaceflight1, with limited understanding of the molecular signaling causing these phenotypic changes. Here, we report that enhanced Ca2+ uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca2+ uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, including Gpc4, Tle4, Rspo3, and Klhl31. The lower Ca2+ uptake in FLT SOL is also correlated with significant weight loss for the SOL muscle in the RR1 flight samples (t-test p-value < 0.05); whereas there is no significant change in weight for TA muscles (Table 1). Overall, the analysis provided here suggests that TA muscles are more resilient to space conditions, and Acyp1 and Rps7 seem to be good candidates to counteract weight losses and poor Ca2+ uptake observed in SOL muscles.

We noted a variety of mathematical functions in the QLattice models from our analysis, including bivariate Gaussian, bivariate multiply, univariate tanh, addition, multiplication, and log. The response plots provided by QLattice help translate the mathematical functions into biological and mechanistic interpretations (Supplementary Fig. 9). We noted that when Gaussian functions are reported, only the first half of the Gaussian curve is being used to fit a sigmoidal trend (Supplementary Fig. 9). Biologically, we interpret this to be because biological quantities (e.g., calcium concentration) cannot be negative, nor cannot exceed a certain threshold (e.g., the total amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Thus, linear models would actually fail to extrapolate in these more extreme ends of the quantity’s range, while sigmoidal models would fit much more accurately. To further improve the predictive capability of this tool, it would be valuable to further characterize the relationship between the mathematical functions identified by QLattice and the distribution of protein concentrations in various tissues. Such characteristics would help further translate the interactions of the various functions found in QLattice with an actual biological process between different key components of a tissue. While additional study is needed to fully characterize the relationships identified here by QLattice, we suggest that QLattice’s emphasis on concise, interpretable models makes it an especially appropriate ML methodology for research applications where explainability is key. Biomedical research, and especially space biology research, presents the additional challenge of small sample sizes, which usually leads to severe overfitting and a lack of generalizability in the models found by conventional ML algorithms. This issue is at least partially addressed by QLattice’s predisposition to limit the architectural complexity of models (which has a strong regularizing effect), as well as its heavy intrinsic feature selection based on mutual information with the target variable. A valuable future study would be to characterize the relationship between the individual data modalities and the overall multi-omics results. As demonstrated in this study, when an ML method properly accounts for these challenges and priorities specific to space biology research, it can provide significant guidance for what to focus on in future research. Although the top biomarkers from QLattice must be further characterized and confirmed, the method has appreciably narrowed the research “search space” by directing us toward groups of biomarkers that are most promising. In this way, explainable and interpretable ML, with its advantage over humans in being able to process huge feature spaces, serves as a metaphorical “metal detector,” telling us where we should start digging. The results we report here would benefit from future experimental validation studies. We conclude with our observations on the contributions of the different types of omics data to the QLattice predictive models. In this work, DNA methylation CpG+ features, when mapped to gene names or when maintained as genomic coordinates, failed to greatly contribute to model architectures and resulted in lower predictive performance. We suggest that this may be because methylation marks are deposited over time, so molecular changes during spaceflight are primarily dominated by functional changes, while small but persistent epigenetic changes may be better captured upon return to earth. To test this hypothesis, future studies could capture methylation measurements both before and after spaceflight from the same animals. In accordance with this hypothesis, both protein and gene expression changes were the most predictive features, with the top proteomic features much stronger and more cohesive than those of top RNA-seq features. This may constitute support in favor of focusing on proteomic analysis over RNA-seq analysis in future spaceflight studies, as the relationship between proteins and function is more immediate compared to the presumably noisier relationship between transcripts and function. Taken together, our results build on previous work in the field by reporting a promising demonstration of an explainable ML method for space biology research and providing several potential biomarkers for future study on muscle response to spaceflight.Methods RNA sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscles—female) For RNA-seq RR-1 data, we started with the raw count files available on OSDR from the GeneLab RNA-seq processing pipeline29. We filtered out lowly expressed genes with unreliable reads (i.e., we only kept genes that had at least 10 non-zero reads in at least 3 samples), resulting in a reduction of dimensionality from 55,536 genes to 15,848 genes for OSD-104 and 16,660 genes for OSD-105, with an overlap of 15,216 genes between the two datasets (Supplementary Fig. 5g). We then applied a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2 v1.34.030, which corrected for library size/sequencing depth and mitigated heteroskedasticity and skewed distributions. The mean-variance relationship and count distribution were checked post-normalization to confirm the effectiveness of preprocessing (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d, Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). Within- and across-group gene expression variance distributions show greater variance spread for the FLT samples than the GC samples (Supplementary Fig. 5a–f).Proteomics data (RR-1—TA muscle only—female) The proteomics data for OSD-105 was collected in two runs of TMT-labeled mass spectrometry with a bridge channel in each run consisting of a pooled sample of all FLT and GC samples31. To ensure values were comparable when combining the runs, we used the ratio of expression values for each sample relative to that of the corresponding bridge channel. After combining the data from the runs, we performed a log2 transformation of the expression values, filtered out proteins with too many missing values, and applied VST normalization, all using the DEP v1.16.0R package32. Again, the mean-variance relationship and distribution were checked (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). We then imputed missing data using K-nearest neighbor imputation, which did not significantly affect the distribution (Supplementary Fig. 4a, c). Finally, we removed any remaining batch effects between the two runs that were amplified through the preprocessing steps using methods from the limma v3.50.3R package, which are appropriate to apply on properly transformed proteomics data33. The removal of batch effects was confirmed using paired PCA plots of the top principal components (PCs) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, d). The preprocessed dataset contained 1786 proteins.Bisulfite sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscle—female) Raw bisulfite sequencing FASTQ files were processed using the Nextflow nf-core methylseq pipeline (v1.6.1), which uses the Bismark aligner for genome alignment and extracting methylation calls (Supplementary Fig. 2a)34,35. The processed data were filtered to only CpG-type methylated sites, as non-CpG methylation is usually restricted to a few specific cell types (e.g., pluripotent stem cells, glial cells, neurons) that are not as relevant in this context (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d)36. The methylation sites were then mapped to their corresponding genes. For each methylation site, we found the gene whose chromosomal range included the site. Methylation sites that didn’t fall into annotated gene regions were discarded, as the current study focuses on mechanistic relationships between coding features. We then calculated the percentage of CpG sites in each gene that was methylated (% methylation). There were 48,368 and 47,660 methylation features for OSD-104 and OSD-105, respectively, after preprocessing (distributions shown in Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). We experimented with using site-level methylation features instead of gene-level methylation features, but this resulted in severe overfitting of ML models. The remaining methylation features overlap with the majority of the genes measured in the RNA-seq datasets, although a majority of the methylation loci do not map to an RNA-seq gene (Supplementary Fig. 5g). In order to assess whether the loci with the highest percent methylation are related to the genes with the lowest expression, as would be expected mechanistically, we compared the top 10% methylated genes with the bottom 10% expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 5h). There is some limited overlap but less than would be expected considering the overlap of all genes and methylated loci.Calcium reuptake data (RR-1 SOL female, RR-9 TA male) Calcium reuptake data was acquired from OSDR dataset OSD-48837, which contains rates of Ca2+ uptake in the muscle homogenates measured in a 96-well plate using the Indo-1 Ca2+ fluorophore1. These values were collected as a time series, with the measurements of cytoplasmic calcium concentrations taken at multiple points in time during a period of muscle relaxation. For our analysis, we use the area under the curve (AUC) as a measurement of calcium reuptake change over time. A lower AUC value implies more efficient calcium reuptake. For this study, we did not have multi-omics and calcium uptake measurements from the same animals. Therefore, for comparing omics and calcium uptake data, we assigned calcium reuptake values to omics samples based on perturbation analysis to identify the optimal pairing (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. 8). It is well characterized that there are significant physiological and molecular differences between muscle samples from spaceflight and ground samples1,2. We inferred that this difference would be greater than within-group differences in mission, age, and sex and would allow us to identify the spaceflight effect relationship between omics features and calcium uptake. Specifically, the SOL calcium reuptake measurements were collected from age- and sex-matched mice from the same RR-1 cohort as the OSD-104 SOL omics data. There was no TA calcium reuptake measurement done in the RR-1 cohort; the OSD-488 dataset only had TA calcium reuptake measurements collected from 10-week-old male mice flown on the RR-9 mission. We, therefore, paired the TA muscles calcium reuptake from these 10-week-old male mice with the OSD-105 TA multi-omics data, which are from older females.Model hyperparameters The primary hyperparameters for QLattice (feyn package v3.0.2) were the number of epochs and the maximum complexity of the architectures. The number of epochs corresponded to the number of generations for the evolutionary search algorithm as a whole rather than the number of epochs of backpropagation for any individual model architecture being explored. We tried various values for the number of epochs between 10 and 100, but there were no significant differences in validation performance or feature rankings. The maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 4 (2 features and 2 functional interactions) for the SOL analysis since SOL data had two data types, and we were interested in modeling the interactions between the data types. Similarly, the maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 6 for the TA analysis.Statistical analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Enrichr implementation in the gseapy library (v0.10.4) in Python, using GO_Biological_Process_2021 as the background gene set. Boxplots were generated using seaborn (v0.11.2) in Python, with statistical annotations calculated using the statannotations package (v0.5.0) implementation of the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon two-sided test.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (3.6MB, pdf) Reporting Summary (111.3KB, pdf) Acknowledgements Resources supporting this work were provided by the NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center.

    "abstract": "Abstract Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight. Subject terms: Phage biology, Bacteriophages, Microbial ecology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Human space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the emergence of commercial space tourism is redefining the risks associated with space travel. Adverse health effects due to host-microorganism interactions is acknowledged by the NASA Human Research Program, and currently this risk is accepted for short duration spaceflight. However, as flight durations increase and the population that experiences spaceflight expands beyond professional astronauts, it is of increasing importance to understand the interplay between microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, ionizing radiation, altered host-microbe interactions, etc.) and human health. Microorganisms on the International Space Station (ISS) are undergoing adaptation and host-mediated propagation throughout the environment1–3. Studies to date suggest microbes on the ISS, predominantly derived from the crew microbiome, are enriched in functions related to metal ion tolerance, dormancy, and antibiotic resistance3,4. A primary mechanism by which bacteria adapt to novel environments and stress is through genome plasticity, the ability to uptake exogenous genetic material5. The presence of temperate bacteriophages, or prophages, in bacterial genomes is one of the main factors that enable genome plasticity6. The entrance of a phage into a bacterial genome is performed through the process of lysogeny, forming a “dormant” prophage containing the entirety of the bacteriophage DNA that is not actively bactericidal, but can undergo replication into a mature virus. These prophages can remain dormant for extended periods of time, or switch into their active (lytic) state, typically after intense DNA damage. Lytic phages can become bactericidal and infect other bacterial cells, taking either their lytic or lysogenic state in their new host7. Prophages dramatically alter their host’s physiology. The presence of prophages can disrupt and silence bacterial genes, and they can cause chromosomal rearrangements, leading to changes in gene expression in their bacterial host. Prophages can confer host immunity to other bacteriophages, preventing lytic attack8. During the transition to the lytic state, prophages can copy adjacent bacterial genes, integrating them into the viral genome. This genetic material is transferred to new bacterial hosts9. Examples of phage transduced functions include virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, toxins, effector proteins, and regulatory proteins8. Prophages also affect microbial populations at the community level. The introduction of bacteriophages into soil samples significantly changed the microbial composition and diversity of the soil microbial community10. In aquatic environments, bacteriophage lyse 20–40% of bacterial biomass per day11. In mouse model studies, both temperate and lytic phages influence the host gut microbiome, with lytic phages leading to a more beneficial community, and temperate phages leading to dysbiosis12. The role of bacteriophage in the adaptation of bacteria to the spaceflight environment is unknown. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of microbial communities in spaceflight, with changes noted in the composition of both the gut and skin microbiomes of astronauts13. While other studies have noted the presence of prophages in a single bacteria species isolated from the ISS14, in this work we show a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and characterization of prophage that inhabit the spacecraft-built environment.",
    "methods": "Methods Flight and terrestrial genomes Candidate flight species to use in our analysis were determined from literature42–44. Isolates from the ISS were identified in the  databases18 by searching the BioSample database for “geo_loc_name=USA: International Space Station”[attr] AND “SPECIES NAME”. These hits were mapped back to the  Assembly database and the flight genomes were validated and downloaded. The terrestrial genomes were downloaded from the Assembly database with the following conditions: Latest RefSeq only, Exclude anomalous and Taxonomy Check Status OK. The Assembly Level differed based on analysis with Scaffold and above used for pangenome analysis and Complete genome was used for prophage identification. The Assembly Level for all ISS flight genomes were either Scaffold or Contig. Metagenomes were downloaded from the NASA Open Science Data Repository OSD-69 (DOI: 10.26030/cary-q426)45. A full list of genomes, reference links and sampling locations can be found in Supplementary data 1. Prophage identification and classification Prophage regions for both ISS and terrestrial isolates were identified with PHASTER17. Results were separated into complete, questionable, and incomplete prophage regions and the prophage regions in fasta format were downloaded from the PHASTER web-based server. In addition, flight and terrestrial genomes, downloaded from  using E-utilities (v 1.77) in GenBank format, were also searched for prophage regions using PhiSpy [v4.2.20,19] using default parameters. PhiSpy prophage regions consistent with PHASTER prophage regions were analyzed using ABRicate (v1.0.0, Seemann T, Abricate, Github https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) with all associated databases46–53 to identify antibiotic resistance genes in prophage regions. Fasta files of the bacterial genomes without prophages were exported and used for the flight isolate genome diversity analysis. Prophage regions from ISS strains were queried against the Virulence Factor Database (accessed April 2023)53 to identify putative virulence factors using  Blast20. Statistical differences in prophage number were determined using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U rank test, correcting for ties, as implemented in SciPy [v1.7.3,54]. The effect size was computed as the common language effect size f value where f=Un1n2. The U-statistic and f value were reported for the terrestrial condition. Prophage regions identified as complete were clustered using MeShClust [v3.0,55] with a cut off of 90% nucleotide identity. The nucleotide sequence labeled as the center of each cluster was assessed for homology with known viral and bacterial sequences in the  RefSeq genome database21 using BLAST [Megablast20, accessed November 2022] and high confidence genomes in the IMG/VR database [v4.1, accessed July 202322]. Phage classification was determined based on the taxonomic similarity to the best hit in the viral database (query coverage percentage multiplied by percent identity > 40%). Pangenome analysis Pangenome analysis of the flight and terrestrial genomes from  and the NASA Open Science Data Repository56 was completed using the pangenomics workflow57–59 in anvi’o [v7.160]. For Bacillus thuringiensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the terrestrial genomes were subsampled into sets of 300 genomes and the pangenome workflow run separately on each subset (2 sets for B. thuringiensis and K. quasipneumoniae each, and 3 sets for S. epidermidis). For the ISS flight genome diversity analysis, the non-prophage containing bacterial genomes output from PhiSpy was used for analysis. Outputs from the anvio-summarize function were parsed for the number of genomes in which each gene was present. The core pangenome was defined as genes present in at least 90% of the genomes (or for ISS species with less than 10 genomes, the cutoff was n-1 genomes, where n is the number of available genomes). The accessory pangenome was defined as the difference between the core pangenome and the total number of genes in the pangenome. The core ratio was the defined as the number of genes in the ISS flight core pangenome versus to all-strains (ISS and terrestrial) core pangenome. The core pangenome fraction was defined as the number of genes in the core pangenome divided by the total pangenome size (core plus accessory). For the functional enrichment analysis, the full bacterial genome with prophage regions was used for analysis. Functional enrichments between flight and terrestrial strains were determined using the built in anvi-compute-functional-enrichments-in-pan workflow59 with COG20_FUNCTION as the annotation source. This workflow used the two-tailed Rao test statistic to determine the significance of a categorical variable (in this case flight versus terrestrial) to explain the functional occurrence. The resulting p value was corrected for multiple tests and reported as a q value, with a set significance threshold of q < 0.05. For species with subsampled genomes, a COG was considered enriched if it was present at a q value (p value adjusted for multiple tests) of 0.05 or lower for at least two subsets. Enrichment summaries and outputs from the anvio-summarize script were used for downstream analysis. Mitomycin C and UV treatment of ISS bacterial isolates Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1), Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were provided by the Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 30 °C. Cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 and 4 mL was placed in a 30 mm diameter plastic petri dish. With the lid removed, the cultures were subjected to aggregate UV doses of 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 J m−2 of UV-C radiation from a G30T8 UV lamp (75 µW cm−2 at the plate surface). Doses were determined using a 2π UV-B/C light probe connected to a hand-held light meter (ILT2400, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA) in integrate mode. After each dose was delivered, duplicate 200 µL aliquots were removed from the petri dish and placed into separate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Cell growth was determined by microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm once per hour (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Negative control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-course culture data prior to analysis. For the mitomycin C treatment, flight isolates grown overnight in TSB at 30 °C were diluted to 0.3–0.4 OD600 and 200 µL was aliquoted into a 96-well plate. Mitomycin C stock solution in DMSO (10 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was diluted to 110 µg/mL in TSB before being serial diluted five times at 5× dilution in TSB. 5 µL of these dilutions, along with a TSB control, were added to separate wells of the culture-containing 96-well plate (2 technical replicates per isolate) resulting in a final concentration set of 500, 100, 20, 4, 0.8, and 0.0 ng mL−1. Cell growth was determined by microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm once per hour (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Negative control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-course culture data prior to analysis. For phage isolation attempts, 5 mL of cultures were grown to mid-log phase before being treated with mitomycin C (0.5 µg/mL final concentration). Cultures were returned to the 30 °C incubator overnight. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was filtered through a low-protein binding 0.22 µm PES syringe filter. To the clarified supernatant, a PEG8000, NaCl stock solution was added to yield a final concentration of 8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl. Solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C, transferred to triplicate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Tubes were visually examined for the presence of phage pellets. Long-read genome sequencing of bacterial isolates Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1), Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were grown on tryptic soy agar plates. After 72 h the plates were scraped and biomass was suspended in 1 mL of buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0), and genomic DNA was extracted via a lysozyme, proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as outlined in61. DNA quality was assessed by fluorometric quantification (Qubit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, as well as Staphylococcus saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, were excluded from the sequencing run due to biofilm polysaccharides preventing extraction of gDNA with sufficient purity for MinION sequencing. All gDNA manipulations were performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent genomic DNA (gDNA) shearing. Native gDNA was sequenced on a MinION R9.4 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). The sequencing library was prepared using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK004, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing Fast5 files were base-called using the ONT Guppy base-caller (v6.2.1) using the super high accuracy model. Genomes were assembled using Flye [v2.9.162] and polished with the ONT tool Medaka (v1.7.0, https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) using default parameters for both. Closed contigs were checked for prophage regions using the PHASTER web-based interface as outlined above. Functional annotation of prophage regions Open reading frames encoded within the prophage nucleotide sequences from the PHASTER output were determined using the  ORFinder18. Open reading frames were annotated using MicrobeAnnotator [2.0.5,63], using DIAMOND search for homology determination58. The output file was combined with the E values for the homology scores and any E value higher than 1 × 10−40 was flagged for manual curation. Proteins flagged for manual curation were compiled into a single file in fasta format and searched against the  RefSeq database. The results were curated for accuracy and confidence and the annotation added to the summary file. All annotations in the summary file were then manually assigned to one of 21 categories based on their functional annotation. All data visualization was performed using in Python (v3.9) using Jupyter Notebooks [v1.0.0,64] and the packages Matplotlib [v3.5.1,65] and Seaborn [v0.11.2,66]. Additional packages used for analysis included NumPy [v1.22.3,67], Pandas [v1.4.2,68,69], and Biopython [1.79,70]. No custom code, algorithms, or scripts central to the research were generated.

    "results": "Results Genome summary and sampling cadence and locations The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment consisting of 388 cubic meters of habitable space. Crew size has ranged from 3 to 10 over the 22 years of continuous habitation. Surfaces within the occupied modules have been continuously sampled and analyzed for microbial populations to understand the microbiome of the built spacecraft environment. We set out to analyze the genomes that resulted from these experiments to assess the role of bacteriophage in the spacecraft-built environment. We identified 10 bacterial strains of interest (see Methods): Acinetobacter pittii, Bacillus amyloliquifaecins, Bacillus thuringiensis, Enterobacter bugandensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Pseudomonas fulva, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. These 10 species represent isolates from sampling campaigns spanning from 2006 to 2018 from eight locations within the ISS (Fig. 1) and a Crew Resupply Vehicle while it was docked with the ISS. Overall, 245 spaceflight genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes15 were included in our analysis. A full table with links to genomes and data sources can be found in Supplementary data 1. Fig. 1.

Images courtesy of NASA. Prophage region identification and comparison We extracted prophage regions from flight genomes for each species using PHASTER16,17 and summed the prophage regions identified (categorized by PHASTER as complete, questionable, or incomplete), as these region numbers are proportional to the number of prophages that, at some point, lysogenized and entered the bacterial genome. For comparison, we obtained all terrestrial, complete genomes for these species from 18 and determined the number of prophage regions for these genomes ( accessions can be found in Supplementary data 1). Average number of prophage regions in the flight genomes ranged from 0.75 per genome for M. luteus to 7 for P. fulva (Fig. 2). For M. luteus, 3 of the 8 flight isolates had two possible incomplete prophage regions per genome, but the PHASTER results suggested they were low confidence annotations and prophage analysis by PhiSpy19, which employs more stringent criteria, did not identify any prophage regions. Thus, M. luteus was removed from further analysis. Of the nine remaining species, all had multiple incomplete prophage regions and at least one complete phage, which, in theory, could convert to a lytic phenotype. In addition, five species presented with poly-lysogeny defined as containing multiple complete prophages. There were no universal trends in the number of prophage regions in the flight genomes versus the terrestrial isolates (Fig. 2), with four species having significantly more prophage in flight genomes, four with more in terrestrial, and one that was insignificant (Fig. 2, Mann–Whitney, two-sided, p < 0.05). Fig. 2. ISS (flight) versus terrestrial prophage counts. Open in a new tab The median is indicated by a dashed horizontal line for each condition (flight or terrestrial) for each species. The number of genomes in the flight and terrestrial categories are indicated adjacent to each group of data. Two-tailed Mann–Whitney p value, for H0 nflight = nterrestrial, and the U-statistic and Common Language Effect Size (f) for the terrestrial condition are shown. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Due to the consistency in flight isolate prophage numbers for most of the species investigated (Fig. 2), coupled with the sampling cadence on the ISS (Supplementary data 1), we explored the genomic diversity between the flight isolates and the terrestrial strains. We used a pangenome approach to compare the similarity within the flight strains for each species, compared to the pangenome for all strains of the same species (all genomes in  with an Assembly level at or above scaffold). We defined the core pangenome as genes present in at least 90% of the genomes, with the remaining genes defined as the accessory pangenome. We looked at two metrics for our analysis. First, we looked at the ratio in the size of the flight-strain pangenome versus the all-strain pangenome, working from the assumption that the more similar the flight strains, the larger the flight-strain core genome. Second, we took the fraction of the flight-strain core pangenome versus the total flight-strain pangenome (core plus accessory), as the smaller the accessory genome the less genetic diversity between the ISS strains. For high-confidence prophage regions (prophage calls consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms), we removed the prophage regions from the genomes (replaced with N) to capture phage-independent genome variability. Flight strains for four of nine species (B. amyloliquifaeciens, K. quasipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus) had a core pangenome fraction of 0.90 or less (Supplementary data 1). The accessory pangenome of the remaining five species was 3% or less of the total pangenome, suggesting a high level of genetic similarity between the flight strains for these species. The ratio of the flight strains’ core pangenome versus the total species core pangenome was larger for all species, as expected for strains continuously sampled from the same environment. However, the magnitude of the ratio mirrored the change in the core pangenome fraction with the K. quasipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus flight strains having similarly sized core pangenome as the all-strain pangenome (1.06, 1.01, and 1.03, respectively). S. epidermidis had the most longitudinal sampling cadence with 30 separate samples taken over 12 years (Supplementary data 1), which correlated with the highest level of genetic diversity between flight genomes (flight versus all core ratio of 1.01 and a flight ISS core fraction of 0.54). However, there were no clear trends in the pangenome comparison versus sampling cadence for the remaining eight species. For example, the 21 flight strains for A. pittii were sampled across three campaigns, two of which were 3 years apart. Still, these genomes showed the highest pangenome core ratio (1.21) and a flight core versus total pangenome fraction of 0.97, with only 89 genes in the accessory pangenome. S. saprophyticus’ 29 flight genomes came from a similar sampling cadence while having the second most genetic diversity among flight strains. The full genome diversity comparison can be found in Supplementary data 1. We then applied the pangenome approach to determine if prophages contribute to variation between flight and terrestrial strains of the same species. Again, using all genomes in  with an Assembly level at or above scaffold, but not removing the high confidence prophage regions, we identified Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) functions that were significantly different (q value < 0.05) between the flight and terrestrial genomes. For both flight and terrestrial genomes, there were significant differences in gene clusters associated with the phage-associated COG Mobilome (Fig. 3). Terrestrial genomes were enriched for transposases across multiple species, including A. pittii, B. thuringiensis, K. quasipneumoniae, and S. epidermidis, compared to spaceflight genomes. Spaceflight genomes were enriched for Mu-like phage structural proteins in A. pittii, E. bugandensis, and P. fulva and enriched for general phage structural proteins in A. pittii, E. bugandensis, K. quasipneumoniae, P. fulva, and S. epidermidis. Only S. saprophyticus contained prophages that were not significantly different between flight and terrestrial genomes. In addition, A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaecins, B. thuringiensis, E. bugandensis, and P. fulva indicated unique phage-associated gene clusters in both flight and terrestrial genomes suggesting a possible divergence in prophage regions resulting from spaceflight.

Complete prophage classification To investigate the novelty of the flight prophages, we analyzed the complete prophage regions in comparison to known phage. In total, 283 complete prophage regions were identified in the 9 bacterial species’ flight genomes and all 283 were consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy, suggesting high confidence prophage annotations. We clustered these complete prophages into 71 bins of >90% similarity, and determined the hypothetical phage family of each cluster by  nucleotide BLAST search [Megablast20] of viruses in the RefSeq Genome Database21 and the IMG Viral (VR) Database22. The IMG Viral database was the more comprehensive of the two with an average query identity score (nucleotide identity multiplied by alignment percentage) of 55%, compared to 28% for the RefSeq viral genomes. Of the 71 clusters, 11 were unclassified (15%) based on having a total query identity of less than 40% with any phage in the RefSeq or IMG VR Databases. Of the remaining 60 clusters, all complete prophages were found to be tailed phages of class Caudoviricetes (Supplementary data 1). Of these 71 intact prophage clusters, 21 could be classified as novel species and 26 as novel genera based on current suggested cutoffs of 95% query identity for species and 70% for genera23 (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Homology of complete prophage regions versus viral and genome databases. Open in a new tab a Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq and IMG viral databases. The higher value between the two databases was plotted. b Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq bacteria database. Vertical dashed lines indicate the 0.95 and 0.70 query identity cutoffs. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we determined the homology of the complete prophage regions to bacterial genomes in the RefSeq database. As lysogenic prophage regions are incorporated into the bacterial genome, homologous regions may be present in terrestrial genomes in the bacterial database. The average query identity increased from 55% in the viral database to 80% with the bacterial database. Using the same cutoffs as above, 21 of the 71 clusters would be considered novel at the 95% query coverage cutoff and 16 would be considered novel at the 70% cutoff (Fig. 4b). Of the nine species, only B. thuringiensis lacked a novel complete prophage at the 70% cutoff (hereafter: non-redundant prophage region), suggesting unique prophage-associated genomic content was broadly observed in the flight genomes (Table 1).

Seven isolates from four different BSL1 species [B. amyloliquifaeciens (IIF7SC-B1 and IIF7SW-P4), P. fulva (F8_7S_9B), P. polymyxa (IIF5SW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), and S. saprophyticus (F6_7S_P5 and F5_7S_P13)] were provided by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As the phage induction mechanisms have not yet been explored in these species, we subjected them to two common DNA damaging stimuli, mitomycin C and UV exposure. For all strains, log-phase cultures treated with mitomycin C (500, 100, 20, 4, and 0.8 ng mL−1) showed a dose-response decrease in culture viability, as measured by OD600, ~8 h post-mitomycin C addition (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, cell viability was more variable following UV-C radiation (254 nm; 5, 25, 50, 100, 200 J m−2). Both S. saprophyticus species showed dose-dependent effect on the growth curve (b–c). This was similar to both B. amyloliquifaeciens isolates for the initial 12 h of growth, after which the growth curves were indistinguishable between treatments, which coincided with the formation of a biofilm (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). The data for P. polymyxa was inconclusive as this species’ biofilm growth phenotype made it difficult to standardize culture starting densities and resulted in non-uniform light attenuation during OD600 determination (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). P. fulva growth curves showed very little change in response to UV expose, which may suggest enhanced UV resistance in this ISS isolate (Supplementary Fig. 2a). For all species with more than one isolate, the complete prophages were identical in both strains, preventing us from testing for bacteriophage infection via the soft-agar overlay method. Instead, we attempted to purify phage particles post-mitomycin C addition via filtration (0.22 µm) and precipitation (8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl). While we were unable to recover phage particles, our attempt was cursory, and a more comprehensive exploration of phage induction in these isolates is needed. Long-read assemblies provide insight into mobile genetic elements We explored the contribution of genome assembly level on the prophage predictions by both the PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms. From the seven isolates we sequenced two strains, P. fulva F8_7S_9B and S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, via Nanopore MinION. P. fulva was chosen as all the spaceflight strains are poly-lysogenic with a non-redundant prophage region in each strain (Cluster 52, Table 1). S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 is a member of Cluster 41 containing a non-redundant prophage region (Table 1). Assemblies for both species resulted in a single contig for the bacterial chromosome. S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 contained three plasmids of 30, 33 and 36 kb in length. For this species, all five of the short-read assembly prophage regions mapped to the long-read assembly. However, one short-read incomplete prophage region was missing in the long-read assembly PHASTER analysis, despite the entire prophage region mapping to the long-read assembly (Supplementary data 1). This prophage region was present in the PhiSpy prophage calls for the long-read assembly. In addition, the long-read prophage analysis suggested the complete prophage from this species was truncated in the short-read assembly (42.1 kb versus 56.2 kb). Interestingly, the incomplete prophage #5 from the short-read prophage analysis (Accession: NZ_JAFDPF010000007.1, sequence: 10127 to 19977) was located on the 36 kb plasmid. The prophage analysis for P. fulva F8_7S_9B suggested the short-read assembly led to fragmented prophage analysis. The long-read assembly identified 9 prophage regions, compared to 7 in the short-read assembly, with one short-read incomplete prophage region missing in the long-read assembly analysis (Supplementary data 1). Similar to S. saprophyticus, the entire prophage region mapped to the long-read assembly with no clear reason for its exclusion from the PHASTER prophage calls. This prophage region was not identified by PhiSpy in the long-read analysis. Long-read prophages #1, 5 and 6 were absent in the short-read analysis due to the prophage regions being split across separate contigs in the short-read assembly. Of the two complete prophages in P. fulva F8_7S_9B, a 62.9 kb long-read prophage region was split into two short-read prophage regions due to lying on two adjacent contigs. The other complete prophage region was annotated as a single 47.6 kb region in the long-read assembly but as two prophage regions in the short-read assembly (intact: 35.6 kb and incomplete: 12.1 kb region). The long-read assemblies can be found on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-582, DOI: 10.26030/v6s6-w170) and  (see Data Availability Statement). Functional analysis of prophage region-encoded proteins We selected a representative strain from each species and curated the prophage-encoded bacterial gene annotations to assess the functional contribution of phages to their hosts. Of the functionally annotated content, 46% was uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. Of the remaining content, 20% was annotated as related to phage processes such as structural proteins (e.g., capsid, tail, etc.), lysogeny, and phage replication (e.g., integrases, terminases). The remaining content was annotated as microbial proteins, conferring a variety of capabilities to the host species (Fig. 5). The total number of prophage-encoded bacterial proteins that could be ascribed a function ranged from ~60 for both Staphylococcus species to a high of 102 for E. bugandensis (707 total for all species). The most prominent functional category contained proteins related to Signal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation (104 proteins across all species), followed by DNA Repair and Replication (91 proteins), and Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degradation (65 proteins). To investigate the subset of prophage-encoded proteins that provide unique capabilities to their host, we extracted prophage-encoded annotations that lacked functional homology to host genome-encoded proteins (Fig. 5). We computed a conservation score for each category defined as the fraction of prophage-encoded proteins that were functionally unique. While only consisting of five proteins across three species, Secretion Systems had the highest conservation score of 1.0 (100% of the prophage-encoded proteins conferred a unique capability to their host). Translation, Ribosomal Structure and Biogenesis, as well as Lipid and Fatty Acid Metabolism also had high conservation scores (0.9 for both categories). The prominent prophage-encoded functional categories of Signal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation, DNA Repair and Replication, and Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degradation had conservation scores of 0.6, 0.51, and 0.48, respectively.

Right panel: the subset of prophage-encoded proteins that confer a unique function to their host. *Conservation score: mean of the functionally unique protein count divided by the total prophage protein count for each functional category. Phage-related proteins and uncharacterized/hypothetical proteins were excluded from the figure.Many of the functions conferred by prophage-encoded proteins are correlated to increased fitness in competitive environments. All nine species had putative virulence related genes encoded on prophage regions, with 45% of these conferring unique functions to their hosts. Based on the assessment of antibiotic resistance genes using ABRicate, P. polymyxa prophage contained an aminoglycoside resistance gene (aadK), and S. epidermidis prophage contained two confirmed antibiotic resistance genes, a macrolide resistance gene [mph(C)] and an efflux pump [msr(A)]. Approximately 33% of the putative AMR proteins were possible resistance pumps for macromolecules. A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaeciens, and E. bugandensis all contained prophage-encoded pyocin-related defense proteins. Both Staphylococcus species contained prophage-encoded pathogenicity island genes and enzymes associated with putative virulence or antibiotic resistance functions (Supplementary data 1). A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaeciens, and B. thuringiensis contained prophage-encoded enzymes for deoxynucleotide sugar biosynthesis found in both antimicrobial biosynthetic pathways, such as streptomycin, as well as polyketide biosynthesis related to pathogenicity and antimicrobial activity24. These enzymes were unique to the prophage regions, with no homologs found in the non-prophage host genomic content. Additional prophage-encoded gene products may confer fitness in the built spacecraft environment. Stress response proteins included those associated with sporulation and hibernation and metal resistance genes and transporters. Both categories have been shown to be enriched in spacecraft-associated microorganisms3. Four species had prophage-encoded LexA-related transcriptional regulators or repressors involved in the regulation of the SOS response in bacteria, which have recently been shown to be uniquely present in ISS strains of A. pittii25. This study also showed the presence of the RelBE toxin-antitoxin system in ISS A. pittii strains, which is also prophage-encoded.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species5,7, which holds in the spaceflight environment as phage-associated genes were significantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed. Several spaceflight species contained genes related to the production of Mu-like phage proteins compared to their terrestrial counterparts. Mu-like phages are unique in that they randomly integrate into the host genome, increasing mutation rates and host gene disruption26. Increased genetic diversity via Mu-like phage induced mutation may assist in microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment and would explain the retention of these phage in flight strains. In comparison, terrestrial genomes contained transposases absent in the flight strains. Transposases are common in dense populations where there is rampant DNA sharing across a population of individuals27. The absence of these transposase regions may be related to the nutrient poor environment of the ISS. The presence of transposases in the terrestrial organisms may also be indicative of active mobile genetic elements, which we were unable to confirm for the spaceflight isolates. Our analysis suggested a high number of novel prophages in the flight genomes. In total, we identified 283 complete prophages making up 71 unique prophage clusters, 18 of which were hypothesized as novel, and host-related genes making up over a third of the genes present in these prophage regions. While the discovery of novel prophages is not uncommon, with viral dark matter reported to be 70–95% of human associated viromes28,29, a previous viral metagenomic study was able to classify the majority of the viruses in extreme environments30. Prophages are a primary mechanism of bacterial host gene transfer, to include antibiotic resistance and virulence genes31. We identified at least one putative antibiotic resistance or virulence host-related gene within the prophage regions of all species studied. In comparison, <12% of highly antibiotic resistant ESKAPE pathogens carry a prophage-encoded antibiotic resistance gene32. In addition, lysogens carrying antibiotic resistance genes have been shown to provide a fitness benefit for their host31,33. There are several reports of spaceflight-induced increases in antibiotic tolerance or increased antibiotic resistance gene clusters14,25,34–36. With our identification of confirmed antibiotic genes within prophage regions of P. polymyxa and S. epidermidis, as well as the conservation of prophage regions within members of the same species, we describe one possible mechanism for this increased antibiotic tolerance. We also identified categories of genes related to host immunity, stress response, and DNA repair. The presence of prophages within a bacterial host can provide immunity to attack from other bacteriophages or phage-like pyocins by inhibiting lytic phage replication, or repressing other phages37,38. We identified several host immunity genes in the flight prophages that could mediate phage and pyocin resistance. In addition, both Bacillus species contained prophage-encoded sporulation genes, related to persistence in harsh terrestrial environments39,40 and spaceflight3. Prophage-encoded DNA repair genes were present across several species, notably those activated in response to radiation. UV radiation induced activation of lytic phage is well known; however, the ISS structure shields the interior from UV radiation. The presence of DNA-repair genes may play a role in the protection of the host genome from galactic cosmic rays or general DNA damage from desiccation in the built environment41. The association between genomic features enriched in ISS isolates and prophage regions suggest phage are important for adaptation to the spaceflight environment. However, these are correlations, and experimentation is required to directly connect prophage-mediated genetic plasticity with persistence in the built spacecraft environment. In addition, the opportunity for phage infection of microbial strains after they leave the crew microbiome is likely limited. Thus, an important line of inquiry is to assess the lytic-lysogenic traits of microorganisms while they are still host-associated.",

Copyright notice ID: 11096397 PMID: 38750067 Abstract Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight. Subject terms: Phage biology, Bacteriophages, Microbial ecology Viruses that infect bacteria shape microbial communities. Here, authors show that this may hold for bacteria isolated from the International Space Station, with spacefaring viruses correlated to host adaptation to the spaceflight environment.Introduction Human space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the emergence of commercial space tourism is redefining the risks associated with space travel. Adverse health effects due to host-microorganism interactions is acknowledged by the NASA Human Research Program, and currently this risk is accepted for short duration spaceflight. However, as flight durations increase and the population that experiences spaceflight expands beyond professional astronauts, it is of increasing importance to understand the interplay between microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, ionizing radiation, altered host-microbe interactions, etc.) and human health. Microorganisms on the International Space Station (ISS) are undergoing adaptation and host-mediated propagation throughout the environment1–3. Studies to date suggest microbes on the ISS, predominantly derived from the crew microbiome, are enriched in functions related to metal ion tolerance, dormancy, and antibiotic resistance3,4. A primary mechanism by which bacteria adapt to novel environments and stress is through genome plasticity, the ability to uptake exogenous genetic material5. The presence of temperate bacteriophages, or prophages, in bacterial genomes is one of the main factors that enable genome plasticity6. The entrance of a phage into a bacterial genome is performed through the process of lysogeny, forming a “dormant” prophage containing the entirety of the bacteriophage DNA that is not actively bactericidal, but can undergo replication into a mature virus. These prophages can remain dormant for extended periods of time, or switch into their active (lytic) state, typically after intense DNA damage. Lytic phages can become bactericidal and infect other bacterial cells, taking either their lytic or lysogenic state in their new host7. Prophages dramatically alter their host’s physiology. The presence of prophages can disrupt and silence bacterial genes, and they can cause chromosomal rearrangements, leading to changes in gene expression in their bacterial host. Prophages can confer host immunity to other bacteriophages, preventing lytic attack8. During the transition to the lytic state, prophages can copy adjacent bacterial genes, integrating them into the viral genome. This genetic material is transferred to new bacterial hosts9. Examples of phage transduced functions include virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, toxins, effector proteins, and regulatory proteins8. Prophages also affect microbial populations at the community level. The introduction of bacteriophages into soil samples significantly changed the microbial composition and diversity of the soil microbial community10. In aquatic environments, bacteriophage lyse 20–40% of bacterial biomass per day11. In mouse model studies, both temperate and lytic phages influence the host gut microbiome, with lytic phages leading to a more beneficial community, and temperate phages leading to dysbiosis12. The role of bacteriophage in the adaptation of bacteria to the spaceflight environment is unknown. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of microbial communities in spaceflight, with changes noted in the composition of both the gut and skin microbiomes of astronauts13. While other studies have noted the presence of prophages in a single bacteria species isolated from the ISS14, in this work we show a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and characterization of prophage that inhabit the spacecraft-built environment.Results Genome summary and sampling cadence and locations The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment consisting of 388 cubic meters of habitable space. Crew size has ranged from 3 to 10 over the 22 years of continuous habitation. Surfaces within the occupied modules have been continuously sampled and analyzed for microbial populations to understand the microbiome of the built spacecraft environment. We set out to analyze the genomes that resulted from these experiments to assess the role of bacteriophage in the spacecraft-built environment. We identified 10 bacterial strains of interest (see Methods): Acinetobacter pittii, Bacillus amyloliquifaecins, Bacillus thuringiensis, Enterobacter bugandensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Pseudomonas fulva, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. These 10 species represent isolates from sampling campaigns spanning from 2006 to 2018 from eight locations within the ISS (Fig. 1) and a Crew Resupply Vehicle while it was docked with the ISS. Overall, 245 spaceflight genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes15 were included in our analysis. A full table with links to genomes and data sources can be found in Supplementary data 1. Fig. 1.

For comparison, we obtained all terrestrial, complete genomes for these species from 18 and determined the number of prophage regions for these genomes ( accessions can be found in Supplementary data 1). Average number of prophage regions in the flight genomes ranged from 0.75 per genome for M. luteus to 7 for P. fulva (Fig. 2). For M. luteus, 3 of the 8 flight isolates had two possible incomplete prophage regions per genome, but the PHASTER results suggested they were low confidence annotations and prophage analysis by PhiSpy19, which employs more stringent criteria, did not identify any prophage regions. Thus, M. luteus was removed from further analysis. Of the nine remaining species, all had multiple incomplete prophage regions and at least one complete phage, which, in theory, could convert to a lytic phenotype. In addition, five species presented with poly-lysogeny defined as containing multiple complete prophages. There were no universal trends in the number of prophage regions in the flight genomes versus the terrestrial isolates (Fig. 2), with four species having significantly more prophage in flight genomes, four with more in terrestrial, and one that was insignificant (Fig. 2, Mann–Whitney, two-sided, p < 0.05). Fig. 2. ISS (flight) versus terrestrial prophage counts. Open in a new tab The median is indicated by a dashed horizontal line for each condition (flight or terrestrial) for each species. The number of genomes in the flight and terrestrial categories are indicated adjacent to each group of data.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Due to the consistency in flight isolate prophage numbers for most of the species investigated (Fig. 2), coupled with the sampling cadence on the ISS (Supplementary data 1), we explored the genomic diversity between the flight isolates and the terrestrial strains. We used a pangenome approach to compare the similarity within the flight strains for each species, compared to the pangenome for all strains of the same species (all genomes in  with an Assembly level at or above scaffold). We defined the core pangenome as genes present in at least 90% of the genomes, with the remaining genes defined as the accessory pangenome. We looked at two metrics for our analysis. First, we looked at the ratio in the size of the flight-strain pangenome versus the all-strain pangenome, working from the assumption that the more similar the flight strains, the larger the flight-strain core genome. Second, we took the fraction of the flight-strain core pangenome versus the total flight-strain pangenome (core plus accessory), as the smaller the accessory genome the less genetic diversity between the ISS strains. For high-confidence prophage regions (prophage calls consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms), we removed the prophage regions from the genomes (replaced with N) to capture phage-independent genome variability. Flight strains for four of nine species (B. amyloliquifaeciens, K. quasipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus) had a core pangenome fraction of 0.90 or less (Supplementary data 1). The accessory pangenome of the remaining five species was 3% or less of the total pangenome, suggesting a high level of genetic similarity between the flight strains for these species. The ratio of the flight strains’ core pangenome versus the total species core pangenome was larger for all species, as expected for strains continuously sampled from the same environment. However, the magnitude of the ratio mirrored the change in the core pangenome fraction with the K. quasipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus flight strains having similarly sized core pangenome as the all-strain pangenome (1.06, 1.01, and 1.03, respectively). S. epidermidis had the most longitudinal sampling cadence with 30 separate samples taken over 12 years (Supplementary data 1), which correlated with the highest level of genetic diversity between flight genomes (flight versus all core ratio of 1.01 and a flight ISS core fraction of 0.54). However, there were no clear trends in the pangenome comparison versus sampling cadence for the remaining eight species. For example, the 21 flight strains for A. pittii were sampled across three campaigns, two of which were 3 years apart. Still, these genomes showed the highest pangenome core ratio (1.21) and a flight core versus total pangenome fraction of 0.97, with only 89 genes in the accessory pangenome. S. saprophyticus’ 29 flight genomes came from a similar sampling cadence while having the second most genetic diversity among flight strains. The full genome diversity comparison can be found in Supplementary data 1. We then applied the pangenome approach to determine if prophages contribute to variation between flight and terrestrial strains of the same species. Again, using all genomes in  with an Assembly level at or above scaffold, but not removing the high confidence prophage regions, we identified Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) functions that were significantly different (q value < 0.05) between the flight and terrestrial genomes. For both flight and terrestrial genomes, there were significant differences in gene clusters associated with the phage-associated COG Mobilome (Fig. 3). Terrestrial genomes were enriched for transposases across multiple species, including A. pittii, B. thuringiensis, K. quasipneumoniae, and S. epidermidis, compared to spaceflight genomes. Spaceflight genomes were enriched for Mu-like phage structural proteins in A. pittii, E. bugandensis, and P. fulva and enriched for general phage structural proteins in A. pittii, E. bugandensis, K. quasipneumoniae, P. fulva, and S. epidermidis. Only S. saprophyticus contained prophages that were not significantly different between flight and terrestrial genomes. In addition, A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaecins, B. thuringiensis, E. bugandensis, and P. fulva indicated unique phage-associated gene clusters in both flight and terrestrial genomes suggesting a possible divergence in prophage regions resulting from spaceflight.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Complete prophage classification To investigate the novelty of the flight prophages, we analyzed the complete prophage regions in comparison to known phage. In total, 283 complete prophage regions were identified in the 9 bacterial species’ flight genomes and all 283 were consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy, suggesting high confidence prophage annotations. We clustered these complete prophages into 71 bins of >90% similarity, and determined the hypothetical phage family of each cluster by  nucleotide BLAST search [Megablast20] of viruses in the RefSeq Genome Database21 and the IMG Viral (VR) Database22. The IMG Viral database was the more comprehensive of the two with an average query identity score (nucleotide identity multiplied by alignment percentage) of 55%, compared to 28% for the RefSeq viral genomes. Of the 71 clusters, 11 were unclassified (15%) based on having a total query identity of less than 40% with any phage in the RefSeq or IMG VR Databases. Of the remaining 60 clusters, all complete prophages were found to be tailed phages of class Caudoviricetes (Supplementary data 1). Of these 71 intact prophage clusters, 21 could be classified as novel species and 26 as novel genera based on current suggested cutoffs of 95% query identity for species and 70% for genera23 (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Homology of complete prophage regions versus viral and genome databases. Open in a new tab a Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq and IMG viral databases. The higher value between the two databases was plotted. b Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq bacteria database. Vertical dashed lines indicate the 0.95 and 0.70 query identity cutoffs. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we determined the homology of the complete prophage regions to bacterial genomes in the RefSeq database. As lysogenic prophage regions are incorporated into the bacterial genome, homologous regions may be present in terrestrial genomes in the bacterial database. The average query identity increased from 55% in the viral database to 80% with the bacterial database. Using the same cutoffs as above, 21 of the 71 clusters would be considered novel at the 95% query coverage cutoff and 16 would be considered novel at the 70% cutoff (Fig. 4b). Of the nine species, only B. thuringiensis lacked a novel complete prophage at the 70% cutoff (hereafter: non-redundant prophage region), suggesting unique prophage-associated genomic content was broadly observed in the flight genomes (Table 1).

Seven isolates from four different BSL1 species [B. amyloliquifaeciens (IIF7SC-B1 and IIF7SW-P4), P. fulva (F8_7S_9B), P. polymyxa (IIF5SW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), and S. saprophyticus (F6_7S_P5 and F5_7S_P13)] were provided by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As the phage induction mechanisms have not yet been explored in these species, we subjected them to two common DNA damaging stimuli, mitomycin C and UV exposure. For all strains, log-phase cultures treated with mitomycin C (500, 100, 20, 4, and 0.8 ng mL−1) showed a dose-response decrease in culture viability, as measured by OD600, ~8 h post-mitomycin C addition (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, cell viability was more variable following UV-C radiation (254 nm; 5, 25, 50, 100, 200 J m−2). Both S. saprophyticus species showed dose-dependent effect on the growth curve (b–c). This was similar to both B. amyloliquifaeciens isolates for the initial 12 h of growth, after which the growth curves were indistinguishable between treatments, which coincided with the formation of a biofilm (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). The data for P. polymyxa was inconclusive as this species’ biofilm growth phenotype made it difficult to standardize culture starting densities and resulted in non-uniform light attenuation during OD600 determination (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). P. fulva growth curves showed very little change in response to UV expose, which may suggest enhanced UV resistance in this ISS isolate (Supplementary Fig. 2a). For all species with more than one isolate, the complete prophages were identical in both strains, preventing us from testing for bacteriophage infection via the soft-agar overlay method. Instead, we attempted to purify phage particles post-mitomycin C addition via filtration (0.22 µm) and precipitation (8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl). While we were unable to recover phage particles, our attempt was cursory, and a more comprehensive exploration of phage induction in these isolates is needed.Long-read assemblies provide insight into mobile genetic elements We explored the contribution of genome assembly level on the prophage predictions by both the PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms. From the seven isolates we sequenced two strains, P. fulva F8_7S_9B and S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, via Nanopore MinION. P. fulva was chosen as all the spaceflight strains are poly-lysogenic with a non-redundant prophage region in each strain (Cluster 52, Table 1). S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 is a member of Cluster 41 containing a non-redundant prophage region (Table 1). Assemblies for both species resulted in a single contig for the bacterial chromosome. S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 contained three plasmids of 30, 33 and 36 kb in length. For this species, all five of the short-read assembly prophage regions mapped to the long-read assembly. However, one short-read incomplete prophage region was missing in the long-read assembly PHASTER analysis, despite the entire prophage region mapping to the long-read assembly (Supplementary data 1). This prophage region was present in the PhiSpy prophage calls for the long-read assembly. In addition, the long-read prophage analysis suggested the complete prophage from this species was truncated in the short-read assembly (42.1 kb versus 56.2 kb). Interestingly, the incomplete prophage #5 from the short-read prophage analysis (Accession: NZ_JAFDPF010000007.1, sequence: 10127 to 19977) was located on the 36 kb plasmid. The prophage analysis for P. fulva F8_7S_9B suggested the short-read assembly led to fragmented prophage analysis. The long-read assembly identified 9 prophage regions, compared to 7 in the short-read assembly, with one short-read incomplete prophage region missing in the long-read assembly analysis (Supplementary data 1). Similar to S. saprophyticus, the entire prophage region mapped to the long-read assembly with no clear reason for its exclusion from the PHASTER prophage calls. This prophage region was not identified by PhiSpy in the long-read analysis. Long-read prophages #1, 5 and 6 were absent in the short-read analysis due to the prophage regions being split across separate contigs in the short-read assembly. Of the two complete prophages in P. fulva F8_7S_9B, a 62.9 kb long-read prophage region was split into two short-read prophage regions due to lying on two adjacent contigs. The other complete prophage region was annotated as a single 47.6 kb region in the long-read assembly but as two prophage regions in the short-read assembly (intact: 35.6 kb and incomplete: 12.1 kb region). The long-read assemblies can be found on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-582, DOI: 10.26030/v6s6-w170) and  (see Data Availability Statement).Functional analysis of prophage region-encoded proteins We selected a representative strain from each species and curated the prophage-encoded bacterial gene annotations to assess the functional contribution of phages to their hosts. Of the functionally annotated content, 46% was uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. Of the remaining content, 20% was annotated as related to phage processes such as structural proteins (e.g., capsid, tail, etc.), lysogeny, and phage replication (e.g., integrases, terminases). The remaining content was annotated as microbial proteins, conferring a variety of capabilities to the host species (Fig. 5). The total number of prophage-encoded bacterial proteins that could be ascribed a function ranged from ~60 for both Staphylococcus species to a high of 102 for E. bugandensis (707 total for all species). The most prominent functional category contained proteins related to Signal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation (104 proteins across all species), followed by DNA Repair and Replication (91 proteins), and Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degradation (65 proteins). To investigate the subset of prophage-encoded proteins that provide unique capabilities to their host, we extracted prophage-encoded annotations that lacked functional homology to host genome-encoded proteins (Fig. 5). We computed a conservation score for each category defined as the fraction of prophage-encoded proteins that were functionally unique. While only consisting of five proteins across three species, Secretion Systems had the highest conservation score of 1.0 (100% of the prophage-encoded proteins conferred a unique capability to their host). Translation, Ribosomal Structure and Biogenesis, as well as Lipid and Fatty Acid Metabolism also had high conservation scores (0.9 for both categories). The prominent prophage-encoded functional categories of Signal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation, DNA Repair and Replication, and Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degradation had conservation scores of 0.6, 0.51, and 0.48, respectively. Fig. 5. Species-specific prophage-encoded protein functions. Open in a new tab Left panel: all prophage encoded proteins in each species. Right panel: the subset of prophage-encoded proteins that confer a unique function to their host. *Conservation score: mean of the functionally unique protein count divided by the total prophage protein count for each functional category. Phage-related proteins and uncharacterized/hypothetical proteins were excluded from the figure.Many of the functions conferred by prophage-encoded proteins are correlated to increased fitness in competitive environments. All nine species had putative virulence related genes encoded on prophage regions, with 45% of these conferring unique functions to their hosts. Based on the assessment of antibiotic resistance genes using ABRicate, P. polymyxa prophage contained an aminoglycoside resistance gene (aadK), and S. epidermidis prophage contained two confirmed antibiotic resistance genes, a macrolide resistance gene [mph(C)] and an efflux pump [msr(A)]. Approximately 33% of the putative AMR proteins were possible resistance pumps for macromolecules. A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaeciens, and E. bugandensis all contained prophage-encoded pyocin-related defense proteins. Both Staphylococcus species contained prophage-encoded pathogenicity island genes and enzymes associated with putative virulence or antibiotic resistance functions (Supplementary data 1). A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaeciens, and B. thuringiensis contained prophage-encoded enzymes for deoxynucleotide sugar biosynthesis found in both antimicrobial biosynthetic pathways, such as streptomycin, as well as polyketide biosynthesis related to pathogenicity and antimicrobial activity24. These enzymes were unique to the prophage regions, with no homologs found in the non-prophage host genomic content. Additional prophage-encoded gene products may confer fitness in the built spacecraft environment. Stress response proteins included those associated with sporulation and hibernation and metal resistance genes and transporters. Both categories have been shown to be enriched in spacecraft-associated microorganisms3. Four species had prophage-encoded LexA-related transcriptional regulators or repressors involved in the regulation of the SOS response in bacteria, which have recently been shown to be uniquely present in ISS strains of A. pittii25. This study also showed the presence of the RelBE toxin-antitoxin system in ISS A. pittii strains, which is also prophage-encoded.Discussion Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species5,7, which holds in the spaceflight environment as phage-associated genes were significantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed. Several spaceflight species contained genes related to the production of Mu-like phage proteins compared to their terrestrial counterparts. Mu-like phages are unique in that they randomly integrate into the host genome, increasing mutation rates and host gene disruption26. Increased genetic diversity via Mu-like phage induced mutation may assist in microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment and would explain the retention of these phage in flight strains. In comparison, terrestrial genomes contained transposases absent in the flight strains. Transposases are common in dense populations where there is rampant DNA sharing across a population of individuals27. The absence of these transposase regions may be related to the nutrient poor environment of the ISS. The presence of transposases in the terrestrial organisms may also be indicative of active mobile genetic elements, which we were unable to confirm for the spaceflight isolates. Our analysis suggested a high number of novel prophages in the flight genomes. In total, we identified 283 complete prophages making up 71 unique prophage clusters, 18 of which were hypothesized as novel, and host-related genes making up over a third of the genes present in these prophage regions. While the discovery of novel prophages is not uncommon, with viral dark matter reported to be 70–95% of human associated viromes28,29, a previous viral metagenomic study was able to classify the majority of the viruses in extreme environments30. Prophages are a primary mechanism of bacterial host gene transfer, to include antibiotic resistance and virulence genes31. We identified at least one putative antibiotic resistance or virulence host-related gene within the prophage regions of all species studied. In comparison, <12% of highly antibiotic resistant ESKAPE pathogens carry a prophage-encoded antibiotic resistance gene32. In addition, lysogens carrying antibiotic resistance genes have been shown to provide a fitness benefit for their host31,33. There are several reports of spaceflight-induced increases in antibiotic tolerance or increased antibiotic resistance gene clusters14,25,34–36. With our identification of confirmed antibiotic genes within prophage regions of P. polymyxa and S. epidermidis, as well as the conservation of prophage regions within members of the same species, we describe one possible mechanism for this increased antibiotic tolerance. We also identified categories of genes related to host immunity, stress response, and DNA repair. The presence of prophages within a bacterial host can provide immunity to attack from other bacteriophages or phage-like pyocins by inhibiting lytic phage replication, or repressing other phages37,38. We identified several host immunity genes in the flight prophages that could mediate phage and pyocin resistance. In addition, both Bacillus species contained prophage-encoded sporulation genes, related to persistence in harsh terrestrial environments39,40 and spaceflight3. Prophage-encoded DNA repair genes were present across several species, notably those activated in response to radiation. UV radiation induced activation of lytic phage is well known; however, the ISS structure shields the interior from UV radiation. The presence of DNA-repair genes may play a role in the protection of the host genome from galactic cosmic rays or general DNA damage from desiccation in the built environment41. The association between genomic features enriched in ISS isolates and prophage regions suggest phage are important for adaptation to the spaceflight environment. However, these are correlations, and experimentation is required to directly connect prophage-mediated genetic plasticity with persistence in the built spacecraft environment. In addition, the opportunity for phage infection of microbial strains after they leave the crew microbiome is likely limited. Thus, an important line of inquiry is to assess the lytic-lysogenic traits of microorganisms while they are still host-associated.Methods Flight and terrestrial genomes Candidate flight species to use in our analysis were determined from literature42–44. Isolates from the ISS were identified in the  databases18 by searching the BioSample database for “geo_loc_name=USA: International Space Station”[attr] AND “SPECIES NAME”. These hits were mapped back to the  Assembly database and the flight genomes were validated and downloaded. The terrestrial genomes were downloaded from the Assembly database with the following conditions: Latest RefSeq only, Exclude anomalous and Taxonomy Check Status OK. The Assembly Level differed based on analysis with Scaffold and above used for pangenome analysis and Complete genome was used for prophage identification. The Assembly Level for all ISS flight genomes were either Scaffold or Contig. Metagenomes were downloaded from the NASA Open Science Data Repository OSD-69 (DOI: 10.26030/cary-q426)45. A full list of genomes, reference links and sampling locations can be found in Supplementary data 1.Prophage identification and classification Prophage regions for both ISS and terrestrial isolates were identified with PHASTER17. Results were separated into complete, questionable, and incomplete prophage regions and the prophage regions in fasta format were downloaded from the PHASTER web-based server. In addition, flight and terrestrial genomes, downloaded from  using E-utilities (v 1.77) in GenBank format, were also searched for prophage regions using PhiSpy [v4.2.20,19] using default parameters. PhiSpy prophage regions consistent with PHASTER prophage regions were analyzed using ABRicate (v1.0.0, Seemann T, Abricate, Github https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) with all associated databases46–53 to identify antibiotic resistance genes in prophage regions. Fasta files of the bacterial genomes without prophages were exported and used for the flight isolate genome diversity analysis. Prophage regions from ISS strains were queried against the Virulence Factor Database (accessed April 2023)53 to identify putative virulence factors using  Blast20. Statistical differences in prophage number were determined using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U rank test, correcting for ties, as implemented in SciPy [v1.7.3,54]. The effect size was computed as the common language effect size f value where f=Un1n2. The U-statistic and f value were reported for the terrestrial condition. Prophage regions identified as complete were clustered using MeShClust [v3.0,55] with a cut off of 90% nucleotide identity. The nucleotide sequence labeled as the center of each cluster was assessed for homology with known viral and bacterial sequences in the  RefSeq genome database21 using BLAST [Megablast20, accessed November 2022] and high confidence genomes in the IMG/VR database [v4.1, accessed July 202322]. Phage classification was determined based on the taxonomic similarity to the best hit in the viral database (query coverage percentage multiplied by percent identity > 40%).Pangenome analysis Pangenome analysis of the flight and terrestrial genomes from  and the NASA Open Science Data Repository56 was completed using the pangenomics workflow57–59 in anvi’o [v7.160]. For Bacillus thuringiensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the terrestrial genomes were subsampled into sets of 300 genomes and the pangenome workflow run separately on each subset (2 sets for B. thuringiensis and K. quasipneumoniae each, and 3 sets for S. epidermidis). For the ISS flight genome diversity analysis, the non-prophage containing bacterial genomes output from PhiSpy was used for analysis. Outputs from the anvio-summarize function were parsed for the number of genomes in which each gene was present. The core pangenome was defined as genes present in at least 90% of the genomes (or for ISS species with less than 10 genomes, the cutoff was n-1 genomes, where n is the number of available genomes). The accessory pangenome was defined as the difference between the core pangenome and the total number of genes in the pangenome. The core ratio was the defined as the number of genes in the ISS flight core pangenome versus to all-strains (ISS and terrestrial) core pangenome. The core pangenome fraction was defined as the number of genes in the core pangenome divided by the total pangenome size (core plus accessory). For the functional enrichment analysis, the full bacterial genome with prophage regions was used for analysis. Functional enrichments between flight and terrestrial strains were determined using the built in anvi-compute-functional-enrichments-in-pan workflow59 with COG20_FUNCTION as the annotation source. This workflow used the two-tailed Rao test statistic to determine the significance of a categorical variable (in this case flight versus terrestrial) to explain the functional occurrence. The resulting p value was corrected for multiple tests and reported as a q value, with a set significance threshold of q < 0.05. For species with subsampled genomes, a COG was considered enriched if it was present at a q value (p value adjusted for multiple tests) of 0.05 or lower for at least two subsets. Enrichment summaries and outputs from the anvio-summarize script were used for downstream analysis.Mitomycin C and UV treatment of ISS bacterial isolates Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1), Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were provided by the Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 30 °C. Cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 and 4 mL was placed in a 30 mm diameter plastic petri dish. With the lid removed, the cultures were subjected to aggregate UV doses of 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 J m−2 of UV-C radiation from a G30T8 UV lamp (75 µW cm−2 at the plate surface). Doses were determined using a 2π UV-B/C light probe connected to a hand-held light meter (ILT2400, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA) in integrate mode. After each dose was delivered, duplicate 200 µL aliquots were removed from the petri dish and placed into separate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Cell growth was determined by microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm once per hour (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Negative control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-course culture data prior to analysis. For the mitomycin C treatment, flight isolates grown overnight in TSB at 30 °C were diluted to 0.3–0.4 OD600 and 200 µL was aliquoted into a 96-well plate. Mitomycin C stock solution in DMSO (10 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was diluted to 110 µg/mL in TSB before being serial diluted five times at 5× dilution in TSB. 5 µL of these dilutions, along with a TSB control, were added to separate wells of the culture-containing 96-well plate (2 technical replicates per isolate) resulting in a final concentration set of 500, 100, 20, 4, 0.8, and 0.0 ng mL−1. Cell growth was determined by microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm once per hour (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Negative control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-course culture data prior to analysis. For phage isolation attempts, 5 mL of cultures were grown to mid-log phase before being treated with mitomycin C (0.5 µg/mL final concentration). Cultures were returned to the 30 °C incubator overnight. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was filtered through a low-protein binding 0.22 µm PES syringe filter. To the clarified supernatant, a PEG8000, NaCl stock solution was added to yield a final concentration of 8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl. Solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C, transferred to triplicate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Tubes were visually examined for the presence of phage pellets.Long-read genome sequencing of bacterial isolates Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1), Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were grown on tryptic soy agar plates. After 72 h the plates were scraped and biomass was suspended in 1 mL of buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0), and genomic DNA was extracted via a lysozyme, proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as outlined in61. DNA quality was assessed by fluorometric quantification (Qubit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, as well as Staphylococcus saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, were excluded from the sequencing run due to biofilm polysaccharides preventing extraction of gDNA with sufficient purity for MinION sequencing. All gDNA manipulations were performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent genomic DNA (gDNA) shearing. Native gDNA was sequenced on a MinION R9.4 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). The sequencing library was prepared using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK004, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing Fast5 files were base-called using the ONT Guppy base-caller (v6.2.1) using the super high accuracy model. Genomes were assembled using Flye [v2.9.162] and polished with the ONT tool Medaka (v1.7.0, https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) using default parameters for both. Closed contigs were checked for prophage regions using the PHASTER web-based interface as outlined above.Functional annotation of prophage regions Open reading frames encoded within the prophage nucleotide sequences from the PHASTER output were determined using the  ORFinder18. Open reading frames were annotated using MicrobeAnnotator [2.0.5,63], using DIAMOND search for homology determination58. The output file was combined with the E values for the homology scores and any E value higher than 1 × 10−40 was flagged for manual curation. Proteins flagged for manual curation were compiled into a single file in fasta format and searched against the  RefSeq database. The results were curated for accuracy and confidence and the annotation added to the summary file. All annotations in the summary file were then manually assigned to one of 21 categories based on their functional annotation. All data visualization was performed using in Python (v3.9) using Jupyter Notebooks [v1.0.0,64] and the packages Matplotlib [v3.5.1,65] and Seaborn [v0.11.2,66]. Additional packages used for analysis included NumPy [v1.22.3,67], Pandas [v1.4.2,68,69], and Biopython [1.79,70]. No custom code, algorithms, or scripts central to the research were generated.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (625.8KB, pdf) Peer Review File (3.4MB, pdf) Reporting Summary (1.9MB, pdf) 41467_2023_42104_MOESM4_ESM.pdf (350.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (356.2KB, xlsx) Source data Source Data (124.4KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran and Dr. Anna Simpson at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for providing the ISS flight isolates and Dr. Braden Tierney at Weill-Cornell Medical College for his critical review of the paper.

There is a significant knowledge gap in the characterization of macrophage heterogeneity involved in spaceflight-associated dysfunctions, in addition to identifying homeostatic resolution processes. Consequently, teasing apart cell type-specific responses may help characterize distinct immunological processes observed in the spaceflight environment.Macrophage immunobiology in spaceflight Immune cell phenotypes and functions are altered in spaceflight, with known consequences for monocytes and macrophages (Table 1). For instance, elevated monocyte counts were described in crew at 1-day post-flight (>142-day mission)8. In line with this, ISS crew monocyte counts are not significantly altered at early- (14-days), mid- (2–4-months) and late-(6-months) timepoints in-flight, however, are slightly increased immediately upon return to 1 g and at 30-days post-flight7. Collectively, these findings indicate elevated monocyte counts during post-flight may be a factor of immune resolution and recovery. In rodents, on the other hand, absolute monocyte counts isolated from splenocytes were reduced immediately post-flight16. Similarly, other studies in rats report reduced post-flight monocyte counts upon return from a 14-day mission17. Table 1. Spaceflight-induced Macrophage Lineage Phenotypes.

Moreover, rodent quadrupedal models do not recapitulate the bipedal human with an upright, stacked vertebrae spinal column. Therefore, simulated gravity models impact rodents and humans differently (reviewed in18), and may have important implications for monocyte (and other immune cell) functions. The majority of simulated microgravity studies in rodents utilize the hindlimb unloading (HU) model, which lifts rodent hindquarters to cause a cephalad fluid shift similar to what humans experience in spaceflight (reviewed in19). Immunological consequences observed following HU and spaceflight are somewhat similar, such as thymus involution and induced cytokine-type phenotypes (reviewed in20). Additionally, leukocyte differentials are also generally similar between HU rodent models and humans post-flight, including elevated production of inflammatory mediators (reviewed in21). However, careful consideration of spaceflight analog details and a thorough elucidation of all descriptive metadata from spaceflight missions are important for immunological interpretation. In-flight changes of known macrophage lineage mediators have also been reported in crew members. For example, IL12-p406, CXCL-8/IL8, and CXCL-55 cytokines are elevated throughout multiple timepoints, indicating the potential for some degree of macrophage activation under microgravity conditions. In addition, multipaneled measurements of mediators indirectly involved in macrophage activation are elevated in-flight, including IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1RA3, and TNF-α, IL-17F, and IL-62. In line with this, the production of immune mediators CCL-2, IL-10, CRP, IL-6, and IL-1RA are substantially elevated immediately at landing (340-day mission) in the NASA Twins study (n = 1) that were quickly reversed in post-flight recovery22. Induction of TNF-α and IL-1β were also described following in-flight stimulation of the murine bone marrow-derived cell line, B6MP102 cells, with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 12- and 24-hours) on-board STS-37 (6-day mission duration)23. In addition, although macrophage polarization profiles are beginning to be identified in simulated microgravity models and spaceflight24,25 (reviewed in26,27), more studies on these unique phenotypes may better assist with unraveling functional consequences of macrophage alterations in spaceflight (Fig. 1). Recently, Lv et al. discussed a negative role for microgravity on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) differentiation and polarization processes, including non-polarized (M0), pro-inflammatory (M1), and anti-inflammatory (M2) subtypes. Under microgravity and simulated microgravity conditions, differentiation of HPC into macrophages and the polarization of macrophages into M1 or M2 types were mutually impaired24,25 (reviewed in26,27). Thus, spaceflight risk factors may influence macrophage differentiation/polarization processes in flight. Fig. 1. In-Flight Macrophage Lineage Phenotypes. Open in a new tab Representative timeline of the observable phenotypes produced in-flight from Table 1. Each line/color represents a mission experiment with the in-flight days listed above/below vertical nodes. Collective observable phenotypes display increased (above centerline) or decreased (below centerline) activity are depicted visually, including increased production of IL12-p40, CXCL-8, CXCL-5, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-RA, IL-1α, IL-17F, and IL-6 and decreased macrophage differentiation processes from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Created with BioRender.com.In a post-flight study, human monocytes displayed reduced phagocytic activity immediately following short- (8–10 days) and long- (125–195 days) duration spaceflight missions28. Another study found that monocyte phagocytic function was depressed immediately upon return to Earth (within 3 h) and at day 3 post-flight29. Murine splenocyte phagocytosis was also impaired immediately post-flight (within 5 h) after a 13-day spaceflight mission16. The inability to remove cellular debris, apoptotic cells, or pathogens can impede tissue regeneration, nutrient recycling, and can cause tissue damage, which is also a notable dysfunction in the elderly (reviewed in30). Concordantly, astronauts display accelerated aging phenotypes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) post-one-year missions via telomere shortening mechanics2,12, suggesting post-flight macrophages may also have an accelerated age phenotype, that is possibly inflammatory12 (reviewed in31). However, previous work described reduced monocyte expression levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-6, and immunoregulatory IL-10 upon LPS ex vivo stimulation, post-short duration spaceflight shuttle missions (13–16 day missions, STS-124, STS-125, and STS-126)32. Differences in study outcomes may be a due to variables including duration in spaceflight and types of mission exposures (i.e., shuttle versus ISS). Additionally, while recovery to baseline macrophage function may be achieved post-flight on Earth, the time frame to recovery is an important consideration for future exploration missions on lunar and Martian surfaces. Macrophages are also critically involved in directing type-specific adaptive immunity via antigen presentation and the production of lymphocyte differentiation cytokines (reviewed in33). Spaceflight can alter adaptive immunity through impaired T cell function7 and impaired lymphocyte maturation (reviewed in34), both of which can cause immune deficiency. As macrophages play an important role in antigen presentation and can shape lymphocyte effector cell phenotypes, we hypothesize that altered macrophages may significantly alter adaptive immune phenotypes observed during spaceflight. However, due to the complexity of performing in-flight studies to characterize immunological synapses or macrophage-lymphocyte communication processes, these studies have been lacking to date. Nonetheless, one study has characterized the potential for peripheral immune tolerance processes being disrupted in space-flown mice (15-day mission), whereby antigen-specific tolerance, mediated by antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, was compromised and elevated inflammation was recorded post-flight35. This study highlights the potential for fundamental antigen presentation/processing mechanisms being compromised in-flight. Thus, deficits in antigen processing and presentation can influence inappropriate effector lymphocyte establishment, which may be the basis for reported adaptive immune dysfunctions in flight7, although additional studies are required (Fig. 2).

Each line/color represents a mission experiment with the in-flight days listed above horizontal nodes, and post-flight collection time points vertical lines. Collective observable phenotypes that display increased (above centerline) or decreased (below centerline) activity are depicted visually, including monocytic count, phagocytic function, cytokine production, and T cell tolerance outcomes. Each phenotype is color-coordinated with the experimental timeline of missions and collections. Created with BioRender.com.Most studies that characterize macrophage lineage biology and function in response to the spaceflight environment are limited to post-flight outcomes, although some have characterized in-flight cell counts and cytokine/chemokine profiles. As such, additional experimental evidence is necessary to fully characterize unique phenotypes of monocytes and macrophages in spaceflight, including functional outcomes on lymphocyte populations.Tissue-specific macrophage lineages in spaceflight As described above, macrophages can undergo alterations in the spaceflight environment, which may in part contribute to spaceflight-induced conditions. Specialized tissue-specific macrophage lineages in the spaceflight environment are less characterized, such as microglia of the CNS or bone osteoclasts (reviewed in36). Yet, there are some intriguing spaceflight environmental consequences on these specialized tissue macrophage lineages that have been identified, displaying similarities to known terrestrial disorders. For instance, the spaceflight environment (12-day mission murine OSTEO payload) has known effects on osteoclasts resulting in osteoclastogenesis and increased bone resorption37, which may play an important role in exacerbating bone loss in spaceflight, resembling osteoporosis (reviewed in38,39). Furthermore, microglia are brain-resident macrophages that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis by surveying the microenvironment in a resting state. However, when activated, microglia can play a contributing role in neuroinflammation causing bystander tissue damage if unresolved (reviewed in40). Similar to features resembling Alzheimer’s disease41, microglia can be activated by space-relevant galactic cosmic rays (GCR) doses both in vitro and in vivo models of cosmic radiation (reviewed in42,43), leading to cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation in mice44. Interestingly, the removal of microglial populations through cellular depletion in mice can prevent sex-specific GCR effects such as learning deficits and phagocytic activation45, and indicates a potential target for neuroinflammatory regulation in spaceflight-associated radiation models (reviewed in46). Table 2 summarizes some of the similarities identified between various specialized macrophage lineages in spaceflight and associated terrestrial disorders. Table 2. Specialized tissue-specific macrophage lineages in spaceflight. Macrophage Location & Lineage Spaceflight or analog consequences Related terrestrial disorders Reference Bone Osteoclast Increased differentiation, bone resorption, and loss of bone calcium Osteoporosis 37,38,52 Central Nervous System Microglia Cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer’s Disease 41–46 Small & large Intestine lamina propria mucosa macrophages Altered gut microbiome Gut dysbiosis 90 Liver Kupffer cells Reduced populations in liver Liver disease 48,49 Pancreatic-resident Macrophage Unknown function Metabolic disorders and insulin resistance 50 Kidney-resident Macrophage Unknown function Kidney stone formation 51,52 Adrenal-resident Macrophage Unknown function Metabolic disorders, endocrine hormone release, and circadian cycle homeostasis 50,82,83,89 Open in a new tabThere are several research gaps characterizing macrophage lineages in the spaceflight environment and are of interest for future spaceflight studies (Table 2). For example, Kupffer cells of the liver are part of the hepatic macrophage system and play an important role in liver immunological tolerance, producing IL-10 and high PD-L1 expression (reviewed in47). Reduced rat Kupffer cell populations have been previously reported in hepatic tissues post-spaceflight (14-day mission)48, suggesting possible disruption in the maintenance of liver homeostasis and may play a significant role in immunological resolution during inflammatory-induced conditions in spaceflight (reviewed in49), however, more studies are necessary. Similarly, macrophages within other less characterized tissues, such as the pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals also may play important roles, due to parallel terrestrial disorder overlaps with spaceflight-associated conditions of insulin resistance, metabolic disorders (reviewed in50) and renal stone formation risk51,52. However more studies elucidating the role of specialized tissue-resident macrophages lineages are required.Influence of microgravity on macrophage lineages Ground-based, terrestrial analogs of microgravity that assess cells in culture include rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors or rotary cell culture systems (RCCS), and clinostats (2D/3D) or random positioning machines. Other possible analogs that are less utilized include, drop towers and parabolic flight (reviewed in53). As described above, HU and partial weight-bearing suspension are standard rodent models used to simulate microgravity, while head-down tilt bead rest and wet/dry immersions are used in humans (reviewed in53,54). However, analogs can produce disparate responses to true microgravity experienced in spaceflight on the ISS, therefore highlighting the importance of utilizing the ISS for future experiments in this field. For example, 2D clinostats can possibly induce spurious fluid motion and shear stress55, which can have negative immune cell consequences. Further, unless otherwise designed, ground-based microgravity analogs do not include other risk factors that are experienced in the spaceflight environment, such as ionizing radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels, for example1. Therefore, accurately modeling immune function in simulated microgravity analogs that is similar to spaceflight requires careful attention to experimental design. Considering mechanical and intercellular communication between heterogeneous populations of cells and the hypothesis that the cellular cytoskeleton has built-in mechanisms for sensing mechanical stress (reviewed in56,57), it is possible that macrophages may also be sensitive to mechanical stress. Mechanical stress includes stretch and compressive forces, and hydrostatic shear pressures that are experienced within multiple tissue types (reviewed in58), where macrophages reside. Mechanical unloading, or decreased mechanical stress on cells and tissues can simulate microgravity (reviewed in59). At the cellular level, mechanical unloading causes pathological phenotypes via altered cellular mechanotransduction pathways, which may reflect cellular changes in astronauts (reviewed in57). Although mechanosensitivity of macrophages in vivo has not been characterized in spaceflight, several human spaceflight missions report altered cytokine expression profiles2,4,8,28,32,60, which may be a response of altered mechanotransductive signaling cascades in macrophages (reviewed in26,57). These findings underscore complex and dynamic responses in the spaceflight environment and highlight a gap in knowledge that requires further studies. Microgravity analogs can cause actin reorganization and changes in cytoskeletal and nuclear morphology61, which may impact transcriptional or replicative programs. In addition, the plasma membrane physically couples to cytoskeletal anchoring proteins and contains Piezo mechanosensitive channels that transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals (reviewed in62), which may be an important target for future microgravity research. In line with this, the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway involved in actin polymerization and multiple other signal transduction cascades, is downregulated in HPC concomitantly differentiating into macrophages (12-day differentiation process) both in simulated microgravity conditions (12-days) and spaceflight (12-day mission)24, indicating aberrant cell signaling, impaired macrophage maturation, and cytoskeletal disturbances are influenced by the microgravity environment. In line with this, signaling pathways such as STAT3, P38, JNK, FAK-ERK, Rho/ROCK, AKT, CREB, NF-κB, RAC-WAVE-Arp2/3 (reviewed in63,64) and MRTF-A/SRF (reviewed in64,65), may all be engaged in microgravity, which also requires further studies. Monocyte/macrophage migratory behavior is also altered in both simulated microgravity and spaceflight conditions. For example, integrin intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which regulates cellular migration and extravasation, is induced in differentiated U937 macrophage-like cells and BV-2 microglia cells, following rotating wall vessel and parabolic flight (reviewed in66). ICAM-1 is also elevated at 120 h of spaceflight67, which may result in enhanced extravasation processes and immune activity. Thus, microgravity poses a unique and varied environmental change that may require quantitative, comparative, and multifactorial approaches to tease out pathological macrophage mechanisms at the cellular, tissue, and physiological scales.Cosmic ionizing radiation and macrophage destabilization Exposure to photon and particle cosmic radiation, including gamma, X-ray, solar particle events (SPE) and GCR, may further influence macrophage dysfunction during deep space missions. The complex space radiation environment is nearly impossible to simulate on Earth, thus research on space-related ionizing radiation has historically utilized gamma rays and single ion particles68. With the introduction of the newly designed simulated GCR (33-ion sequential beam and simplified 5-ion beam) and SPE dosing schemes (including protracted and acute exposures) developed by the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, more opportunities are available to simulate some aspects of the deep space radiation environment69,70. GCRs are composed of high-energy charged particles, primarily protons, helium ions, and high mass/high energy (HZE) particles68,70, all of which can have detrimental effects on biology (reviewed in71). Characterization of monocyte and macrophage responses to GCRs or their components currently remains inadequately defined. On the one hand, via the metric of apoptosis, macrophages are more radioresistant compared to monocytes, while the lymphoid lineage is even more radiosensitive72. Mice exposed to simulated 5-ion simplified GCR (0.5 Gy) and SPE (1 Gy) irradiation with and without HU displayed no differences in monocyte counts, although reduction in lymphocytes were observed 24-hours post-exposure3. Other studies have reported elevated blood monocyte counts seven-days post-GCR irradiation at comparable doses (0.5 Gy), which positively correlated with impaired spatial learning at five months post-exposure in mice45. This suggests that radiation-mediated damage during myelopoiesis may impact cognitive performance post-irradiation. This effect might be primarily mediated by brain-resident macrophages (microglia), as depleting microglia also improved cognitive outcomes after irradiation45(reviewed in73,74). Although not a comprehensive analog to space radiation, cancer radiotherapy studies have provided some insight into immune phenotypes following ionizing radiation. Indeed, macrophages play an important role in both regulation and resolution of inflammation, for instance certain polarized types of macrophages are prominent in the progression of cancer, while radiotherapy may promote antitumor phenotypes (reviewed in75). Many characteristic inflammatory profiles produced by macrophages depend on cellular abundance and response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), produced from radiation-induced DNA damage76. Thus, in spaceflight, damaged DNA may trigger DAMP receptor pathways inducing inflammatory mediator production2–4,8. Notably, space mission-relevant doses of X-ray irradiation (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 Gy) did not alter macrophage phenotypes77. Interestingly, dose-dependence did alter macrophage phenotypes when cells were cultured in the presence of radiation-conditioned fibroblast supernatant, suggesting physiological mediators, received from other cells were necessary to generate unique cellular phenotypes in response to radiation77. Thus, the complex nature of the space radiation environment and its energies, doses, and dose rates make assessing macrophages function a difficult task. Future studies on this topic will require better characterization of macrophage polarity and responses following acute and protracted doses, combination spaceflight exposures, and longitudinal immune sampling.Isolation, confinement, and extreme environmental stressors Isolation, confinement, and extreme (ICE) environments also pose unique risks to crewmembers on exploration missions78. Operational on-board stressors that fall into this category include circadian misalignment, social isolation, and closed/hostile environments, all of which may impact macrophage biology. Spaceflight and ground analogs indicate that ICE may disrupt circadian rhythms critical to immune functions (reviewed in79,80). More specifically, ICE may impact circadian misalignment by manifesting disruptions in monocyte and macrophage molecular clocks (reviewed in81). Indeed, light (in the form of visible sunlight) is a dominant environmental cue for many biological clock physiological processes, such as sleep/wake, endocrine hormone release, metabolic processes, and temperature regulation (reviewed in82). Circadian misalignment, as a result from irregular light cues in spaceflight, can cause deviations from normal cycling and may have profound impacts on multiple physiological systems83. In line with this, circadian misalignment may innately impact immune function. Indeed, there have been reports describing cell-autonomous clock gene expressions in rat natural killer cells84 and mouse peritoneal macrophages85. Notably, in the absence of the core clock component protein cryptochrome (CRY), elevated proinflammatory cytokine expression mediated through NF-κB activation has been reported86. Further as mentioned above, neuroendocrine hormone release is regulated by the circadian system. For example, glucocorticoid release peaks in the early morning in response to light (diurnal), which integrates with cyclic systemic immunity (reviewed in87), suggesting neuroendocrine system crosstalk with immunity. Indeed, glucocorticoids can also directly impact macrophage polarization phenotypes, indirectly linking immune regulation to circadian cycling88. Therefore, modulation of glucocorticoid production that aligns with circadian cycle regulation in astronauts on deep space missions should be considered in countermeasure designs. Furthermore, diurnal sample collection metadata should also be evaluated during immune response analysis and considered for future experimental design. Social isolation in mice in combination with HU caused population shifting in leukocytes, including neutrophils and lymphocytes, while monocyte populations were unaltered89. These studies further support crosstalk with the neuroendocrine hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is involved in immune regulation. In addition, immune differentials reported in the Mars500 isolation project in humans indicate the effects of extreme isolation on gut microbiome maintenance and immunity, a site populated by macrophages90. In line with this, multiple other isolation analogs, including NEEMO, Antarctica, and MOON-2015 have assessed the influence of isolation on macrophage lineage phenotypes (primarily monocytes), collectively indicating differential outcomes are observed during- and post-study collections (reviewed in91). Differential outcomes may be due to the unique microbial environment present in each analog, further adding to the complexity of macrophage phenotype characterizations. Thus, an important future research direction would be to determine the extent of spaceflight-caused macrophage dysfunction and the mechanistic underpinnings involved in macrophage function as a result of ICE-related operational stressors, along with considering environmental microbial influence.Hypercapnia and macrophage function Increased partial pressure of CO2 aboard the ISS might also contribute to spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction. It is well-accepted that elevated levels of environmental CO2 can cause hypercapnia (elevated blood/tissue CO2 levels). Elevated levels of CO2 impair macrophage ability to defend against foreign invaders by inhibiting the production of cytokines critical for antimicrobial host defense, such as TNF and IL-692. Hypercapnia also downregulates genes associated with innate immunity, antiviral response, and cytokine signaling in both human and mouse macrophages93, while on the cellular level, hypercapnia has been shown to cause macrophage apoptosis and decreased phagocytic activity92,94. For example, hypercapnia can increase influenza A virus replication and inhibit antiviral gene and protein expression in mouse macrophages, which is dependent on the activity of Akt95. Indeed, Akt isoforms can modulate Akt activity levels in macrophages and their polarization phenotypes96; therefore, Akt may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance macrophage host defense. Collectively, these findings suggest deficits in macrophage immunity can be caused by hypercapnic conditions. This emphasizes a critical risk to consider for long-duration ( > 1 year) exploration missions, where exposures to elevated CO2 levels may be experienced for prolonged periods of time.Macrophages and future lunar mission considerations Lunar dust poses a serious challenge for exploration missions to the moon, but the limited availability of authentic lunar dust samples makes it difficult to conduct biological experiments on Earth. Studies of Apollo 14 lunar dust exposure in rats demonstrated lung toxicity when inhaled (reviewed in97). Further, an in vitro study assessed the behavior of a transformed macrophage cell line in the presence of SiO2 and Al2O3 (analogs of lunar dust). In the presence of these mineral particles, phagocytosis was impaired98 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was increased99. In addition, mouse alveolar macrophage counts decrease following lunar dust exposure, along with neutrophil aggregation100, suggesting increased cell death pathways and inflammation in the lung microenvironment may be involved in the pathophysiology of lunar dust exposure. Since macrophages play a major role in phagocytosis and defense against toxins, further studies on macrophage function following lunar dust and other celestial dust exposures are essential for mitigation agendas on future lunar missions.Future outlook and summary A growing body of experimental evidence, reviewed in this monograph, indicates that monocytes and macrophages are altered by the spaceflight environment. These findings have implications for a wide range of physiological processes, including innate immunity, acquired immunity, host defense, and tissue remodeling. Aside from spaceflight, the studies described in this review involve the examination of a single aspect of the space environment (such as weightlessness, space radiation or elevated CO2 levels). Future experiments involving combinations of spaceflight stressors, such as elevated CO2 levels combined with simulated space radiation and gravitational changes, would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of the spaceflight environment on macrophage function. Further investigations of cell- and tissue-specific macrophage responses and phenotypes are also necessary to assess tissue-specific pathologies that connect cellular studies to human disease processes on long-duration missions in deep space. Considering the immune system “computes” the state of health throughout the body (reviewed in96) additional assessment of other immune cell types in the hematopoietic tree is also necessary. In brief, fundamental studies on macrophages in space have begun to lay the groundwork for the development of targeted countermeasures that optimize macrophage function and are needed to address clinical challenges that arise as space exploration moves beyond low Earth orbit.

    "abstract": "Abstract Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m−2) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(–) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions. Keywords: Mars simulation, fungal spores, spore survival, space, radiation, UV, balloon flight, stress resistance",
    "introduction": "Introduction Mariner IV was the first successful robotic mission to Mars producing surface photos and preliminary data used to model atmospheric pressure, layer heights, and temperature (Leighton et al., 1965; Binder, 1966; Fjeldbo and Eshleman, 1968). In the half century since that first pioneering mission, orbital and surface rover missions have continued to characterize the Mars environment – generally regarded as hostile to terrestrial life as we know it. The martian surface features highly desiccating conditions as well as extremely low pressure and temperature. Moreover, lacking a substantial atmosphere and with a weak magnetosphere (Acuña et al., 2001), non-ionizing UV radiation (100–400 nm) as well as high energy solar ionizing radiation (X-rays, Gamma rays, etc.) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) bombard the planet’s surface (Kuhn and Atreya, 1979; Simonsen et al., 1990; Saganti et al., 2004; Hellweg and Baumstark-Khan, 2007; Barlow, 2008; Catling, 2009; Hassler et al., 2014; Martínez et al., 2017). With such an extreme radiation environment, from a terrestrial standpoint, the martian surface appears to be biocidal. To ascertain where life can survive beyond Earth, experiments in the fields of space biology and astrobiology have examined the responses of terrestrial model organisms to simulated and real space conditions (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001; Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2016; DasSarma et al., 2020). Understanding microbial adaptations to either isolated and combined extreme environmental stressors helps (i) establish the limits of life on Earth as we know it; (ii) determine whether terrestrial life could survive on Mars; and (iii) refine the search for life in other extraterrestrial habitats (Horneck et al., 2010; Cockell et al., 2016). With the possible exception of the Viking missions, Mars has been unavailable to date for conducting controlled biological experiments; thus, extreme terrestrial analog environments have been widely used to test instrumentation and microbial survival outcomes (Marlow et al., 2008; Fairén et al., 2010; Suedfeld, 2010; West et al., 2010). Typically, martian analog environments are located on Earth’s surface in regions where aridity, temperature extremes, and elevated radiation dominate the landscape. For instance, the McMurdo Dry Valleys in continental Antarctica and high-elevation deserts in Australia and South America are frequently visited, analog destinations (Clarke and Persaud, 2004; Fletcher et al., 2012; López-Lozano et al., 2012; Heldmann et al., 2013; Musilova et al., 2015). However, high above Earth’s surface in the stratosphere (∼15–50 km), another Mars analog environment exists, presenting a unique combination of environmental insults that more closely resemble conditions on the Red Planet. In the middle stratosphere during daytime hours, the following Mars-like factors are simultaneously present: intense, full spectrum ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high energy ionizing radiation (including secondary scattering), desiccation, hypoxia, and ultralow temperatures and pressures (Clark and McCoy, 1965; Potemra and Zmuda, 1970; Vampola and Gorney, 1983; Keating et al., 1987; Clancy and Muhleman, 1993; Von Engeln et al., 1998; Seele and Hartogh, 1999; Shepherd, 2000; Lambert et al., 2007; Mertens et al., 2016; Caro et al., 2019). Taken together, these combined conditions cannot be found naturally anywhere on the surface of the Earth and would be challenging to easily reproduce in laboratory-based experiments. Reaching the middle stratosphere is relatively achievable compared to suborbital and orbital spaceflight investigations. High-altitude scientific balloons have been used for more than eight decades to study the atmosphere and atmospheric phenomena (Winckler et al., 1959; Winckler, 1960; Murcray et al., 1969; Mertens et al., 2016; Caro et al., 2019) and more recently for conducting biological exposure experiments (Stevens, 1936; Simons, 1954; Sullivan and Smith, 1960; Rainwater and Smith, 2004; Beck-Winchatz and Bramble, 2014; Coleman and Mitchell, 2014; Smith et al., 2014; Khodadad et al., 2017; Smith and Sowa, 2017; Pulschen et al., 2018). In this study, we take advantage of a large scientific balloon mission to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) for exposing microorganisms and measuring their survival and metabolic responses while monitoring ionizing radiation levels and other pertinent environmental conditions. Four microorganisms relevant to astrobiology and space biology were flown inside the Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment (MARSBOx) payload. The two bacterial extremophiles, Salinisphaera shabanensis and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, were included to test the hypothesis that terrestrial microbial strains, isolated from extreme Mars-analog environments, can withstand the stress factors of a martian-like environment. The fungus Aspergillus niger and the bacterium Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis were included in this study because they are human-associated and opportunistic pathogens, and have both been previously detected on the International Space Station (ISS). Thus, they are likely to travel to Mars in crewed space missions (Novikova et al., 2006; Checinska et al., 2015; Be et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019). Moreover, spores from A. niger might resist space travel on the outside of a spacecraft; therefore, understanding their survival potential in a Mars-like environment is of interest to planetary protection. The MARSBOx design was a balloon-compatible, NASA-adapted version of hardware from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) biological exposure missions EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R aboard the ISS (Rabbow et al., 2009; Rabbow et al., 2012, 2015), using the transport and exposure box (Trex-Box) from the European MASE project (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a). To adjust for Mars atmospheric conditions, the Trex-Box was filled with a Mars gas mixture at 5–10 mbar during the mission. Herein, we report results from the first MARSBOx mission and summarize environmental conditions that collectively indicate the most robust Mars analog.",

Titer determination was done using an improved Neubauer cell count chamber on vortexed suspensions; 20 μL of spores were then spotted onto round quartz disks (6 mm ∅, 1 mm thickness; MolTech) in triplicate and left to dry at room temperature (22°C) on the bench. Two spore concentrations were prepared for the MARSBOx flight: 1 × 107 spores mL–1 (spore monolayer) and 1 × 108 spores mL–1 (spore multilayer). Presence of spore multilayer and monolayer was determined qualitatively with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6510, Jeol), operated at 10 Kv (Figure 1). Further experiments using agar plates were done with minimal medium (composition: 55 mM glucose, 11 mM KH2PO4, 7 mM KCl, 178 nM H3BO3, 2 mM MgSO4, 76 nM ZnSO4, 70 mM NaNO3, 6.2 nM Na2MoO4, 18 nM FeSO4, 7.1 nM CoCl2, 6.4 nM CuSO4, 25 nM MnCl2, 174 nM EDTA, 15 g agar, per Liter). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab SEM images of Aspergillus niger spores in (A) multilayer (108 spores mL–1) and (B) monolayer (107 spores mL–1).Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis strain K1-2-2-23 (DSM 111179) was cultivated in tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Difco; composition: tryptone 17.0 g, soy peptone 3.0 g, glucose 2.5 g, NaCl 5.0 g, K2HPO4 2.5 g, per Liter) at 37°C under constant agitation at 200 rpm for 18 h. Stationary phase cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm) in 40 mL culture for 5 min. Cells were washed by removal of the supernatant, resuspension of the pellet in 40 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS; composition: Na2HPO4 7.0 g, KH2PO4 3.0 g, NaCl 4.0 g, per Liter, pH 7.5), and centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The washing step was repeated once and after the last centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mL PBS. Thirty μL of this concentrated cell suspension were pipetted onto the quartz disks and left to dry at room temperature (22°C) on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on tryptic soy agar (TSA; composition: tryptone 17.0 g, soy peptone 3.0 g, glucose 2.5 g, NaCl 5.0 g, K2HPO4 2.5 g, agar 15 g, per Liter) to be 1.4 × 109 cells per disk, resulting in a multilayer of bacterial cells. The facultative anaerobes, Salinisphaera shabanensis and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, were cultivated in liquid microoxic Marine Broth (BD Difco; composition: peptone 5.0 g, yeast extract 1.0 g ferric citrate 0.1 g, NaCl 19.45 g, MgCl2 5.9 g, MgSO4 3.24 g, CaCl2 1.8 g, KCl 0.55 g, NaHCO3 0.16 g, KBr, 0.08 g, SrCl2 34.0 mg, boric acid 22.0 mg, Na4SiO4 4.0 mg, NaF 2.4 mg, NH4NO3 1.6 mg, and Na2HPO4 8.0 mg, per Liter) and microoxic TSB, respectively, in sterile serum bottles with headspace pressure and gas composition of ∼1,010 mbar and N2/CO2 (80/20 v/v), respectively. Cell concentration was determined via cell counting in a Thoma counting chamber. Stationary phase cells from an overnight culture of each strain were harvested by centrifugation (14,500 g) of 1 mL culture for 15 min. To assess possible differences in survival between cells dried in medium (UV absorption of medium components) or dried in non-absorbing buffer, after the centrifugation step either (i) 950 μL of the supernatant were removed, cells were resuspended in the remaining growth media, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk; or (ii) cells were washed with 1 mL PBS (for S. shabanensis the NaCl content was adjusted to 10%), again centrifuged for 15 min at 14,100 g, the supernatant (950 μL) was removed, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk. The desiccation process was conducted under oxic conditions on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on Marine agar/TSA to be ∼108 cells per disk for both strains. Balloon Payload The MARSBOx payload (38.1 cm × 25.4 cm × 63.5 cm; mass 18 kg) was built for simple mounting and integration onto the exterior of large scientific balloon gondolas (Figure 2). Biological samples were enclosed within a pressurized, shielded container (Trex-Box) (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a) with a rotatable shutter that prevented solar radiation exposure during ascent and descent (i.e., experimental initiation/termination). Covering the Trex-Box was suprasil glass: 8 mm thick, with a long pass cut off of ∼170 nm (with 0% transmission), and magnesium fluoride (MgF2), with a long pass cut off of ∼110 nm (custom made by MolTech, Germany) (Figure 3B). During the balloon flight, the MARSBOx system controlled the exposure to UV radiation so that the samples were only exposed at stratosphere altitudes [Figure 4 and Supplementary Videos 1 (ascent), 2 (descent)]. Motors, gears, and the shutter were held together by a frame composed of aluminum cutouts and 3D-printed polycarbonate-ABS components. T-slotted 80/20 aluminum extrusions formed the framework of the payload, with detachable, white powder-coated aluminum panels on each face of the MARSBOx. Angle brackets on the back plate were used to mount the system onto the balloon gondola. The front panel data port contained one micro-USB port, six light emitting diodes (LEDs), and two key switches. One key switch was used to power on the system and the other was used to manually rotate the shutter lid (for loading and removing Trex-Box with samples). The LEDs were programmed to indicate the state of the onboard computer’s health (OSD3358, Octavo Systems) and the status of the computer’s state machine, GPS receiver (GPS_FGPMMOPA6H, Adafruit Industries), camera system (Hero4 Black, GOPRO with Dash controller, CamDo), heater system, and the M-42 radiation dosimeter (Berger et al., 2019).

(B) Balloon flight path; stars mark opening and closing of the Trex-Box lid, which corresponds to UV-VIS radiation exposure beginning and ending.Other major payload components included three pressure sensors (MS5803, MEAS Switzerland; AMS5812, Analog Microelectronics; and BMP085, Bosch Sensortec), four temperature sensors, and a 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). While not flown on this mission, MARSBOx can carry additional instruments (e.g., UV radiometers) located behind the front panel of the payload. For the LDB #697NT flight, power was provided by a 14.8v 25.2 Ah lithium-ion polymer battery (CU-J141, BatterySpace) fastened in place with an ultem 3-D printed battery holder. The MARSBOx payload can also utilize a direct connection to the balloon gondola power source with an acceptable input range of 9V – 36V. The design and technical details of the Trex-Box were previously described in detail (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a). Briefly, the design of the aluminum box was inspired by the EXPOSE mission series on the ISS (Rabbow et al., 2012; Rabbow et al., 2015) using a Trex-Box to control the transport of microorganisms during experiments (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a, 2020). The Trex-Box can be filled with gas and sealed, allowing for a sustained martian gas composition of 0.17% O2, 95% CO2, 0.07% CO, 2.6% N2, and 1.9% Ar during the course of the experiment at Mars-like pressures (∼7 mbar) (Figures 3C,D). The Trex-Box enabled testing of four different microorganisms without cross-contamination (an issue reported in past balloon experiments; see Díez et al., 2020) because each organism was set in one of the four quarter sections of each layer (Figure 3A). Stratospheric Flight Experiment The Trex-Box consisted of two layers of an aluminum 64-well sample carrier, each holding quartz disks with microbial samples (see section “Test organisms, media, and sample preparation for flight”) that were either exposed to direct stratospheric UV radiation (UV-exposed, top layer) or shielded from UV (UV-shielded, bottom layer) (Table 2). The quartz disks were glued into the sample carrier using the biocompatible Vulcanizing Adhesive for Spaceflight Experiments (Wacker Chemie AG, certified by ECSS – European Cooperation for Space Standardization). For each experimental group, three quartz disks were used as ground laboratory controls and remained in normal atmospheric conditions at room temperature (22°C) on the bench until analysis (Table 2).

During the 5-month experimental duration, both flight and control samples were kept desiccated on quartz disks. Table 2 provides an overview of the conditions microbial samples experienced in this study. Estimated UV Radiation Dose The total UV dose [J m–2] that the samples were exposed to during the MARSBOx mission was calculated as follows: Dose(Jm)-2=[Fluence(mWcm)-2×Time(s)]×10 where UV fluence [mW cm–2] values for UVA-UVB (280–400 nm) in the middle stratosphere were taken from a previous flight = 6 mW cm–2 (Caro et al., 2019), and sample exposure time [in seconds] = 19140 s. Samples were exposed to an estimated total of 1148 kJ m–2 of UVA-UVB radiation. Previously modeled UVC (206–280 nm) values by Caro et al. (2019) ranged from about 0.1–1 μW cm−2 for the altitude flown during the MARSBOx mission (∼38 km). Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry: M-42 In order to determine the ionizing radiation environment during the flight, a miniaturized, low-power consumption radiation detector system (M-42) was included onboard the MARSBOx payload. The M-42 instrument (size: 142 mm × 38 mm × 13 mm) was developed at DLR and can actively measure the absorbed dose using a silicon detector diode (Berger et al., 2019). Two batteries allow the M-42 to operate as a stand-alone radiation detector system, but for the MARSBOx flight the instrument was externally powered through the in-built micro-USB connector. Upon launch of the balloon, power was provided and the M-42 started taking measurements. Data were stored every 5 min on a non-volatile flash memory and upon landing the instrument was switched off. Balloon Flight Profile One week before flying, the MARSBOx hardware (without biological specimens loaded) was tested in a hypobaric chamber at the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (Palestine, TX, United States) to validate system performance and commands. The payload was then transported to the launch site at Ft. Sumner, NM, United States (lat 34.49° long −104.2°), where it was mounted onto the top portion of the LDB #697NT gondola. After installation and prior to launch, the payload surface was sprayed with sterile air and wiped down with isopropyl alcohol. The mission carrying the MARSBOx payload was launched on 23 September 2019 at 1400 UTC, with a full video replay of the flight available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8qx_0FmV0. The balloon ascended for 2.5 h until reaching an average float altitude of 38.2 km where it remained for 4 h, followed by a 35-min descent on parachute, landing 172 km west of the launch site (lat 35.29° long −105.1°). Sample exposure began during ascent at 21.4 km with the Trex-Box shutter opening at 1521 UTC and concluded 5 h and 19 min later with the Trex-Box shutter closing during descent at 22.0 km at 2040 UTC (Figure 4). The M-42 dosimeter was turned on at 1405 UTC when the payload was at 3.07 km and remained on until 2119 UTC at 1.75 km above the balloon landing site. Personnel from CSBF recovered the payload on 24 September 2019 and transported it back to the launch site facility inside a climate-controlled vehicle before shipping to NASA KSC at ambient conditions. Three weeks later, samples and instruments (Trex-Box and M-42) were removed from the MARSBOx payload and shipped to the DLR for post-flight analysis. Post-flight Processing After shipment arrival of the samples at the DLR, the Trex-Box was opened within an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory products) to ensure a constant low relative humidity (<13% relative humidity). The quartz disks harboring dried cells and spores were retrieved from the carrier and placed inside 2 mL Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL PBS respectively. For A. niger spore recovery 2 mm glass beads were added. The tubes were vortexed for 30 s to separate the cells from the disk, and the resulting suspension was used for downstream analyses. Determination of Microbial Survival via Standard Plate Counting The post-flight survival of the tested microorganisms was determined by standard plate counting, where serial dilutions (1:10) were plated on nutrient agar. For bacteria, TSA medium/marine medium was used; for A. niger minimal medium supplemented with 0.05% Triton-X was used. Agar plates were incubated for 1–3 days at 37°C for bacteria and 30°C for fungi. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted, and the colony forming units per mL (CFU mL–1) were calculated. The survival fraction was calculated as N/N0, in which N is the CFU mL–1 after sample retrieval and N0 is the initial cell concentration on the quartz disk. Determination of CFU mL–1 included at least three biological replicates per tested strain (n ≥ 3). Determination of Metabolic Activity via Resazurin Reduction To evaluate the potential for revival after exposure to Mars-like conditions, the metabolic activity of the bacterial cells and fungal spores was measured in a 96-well-plate using resazurin reduction as an indicator (alamarBlueTM Cell Viability Reagent, Thermo FisherTM). In each well there was a total volume of 200 μL (130 μL of media, 50 μL of dilutions, and 20 μL of alamarBlueTM). The media used was dependent on the microorganism tested and is summarized in Table 1. The plate was incubated for 44 h at 30°C. OD600 and OD570 were measured every 30 min in a Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (Infinite M200 PRO, Tecan). Orbital shaking of the plate occurred before each measurement. The percentage of reduced resazurin reagent was calculated according to the standard protocol obtained from Thermo FisherTM. Determination of A. niger Spore Germination To determine the post-flight germination of A. niger spores, spore suspensions (106 spores mL–1) from each tested condition were drop plated (3 μL), in triplicate, on MM agar supplemented with 0.003% yeast extract. Plates were incubated at 22°C for 18–27 h. After incubation, light microscopy was used to quantify the number of germinated (G) and non-germinated (NG) spores. At least 200 spores were counted per replicate. Germination was calculated as the average of the G/NG ratio of each replicate per tested condition. Evaluation of Spore Cell Wall Integrity To test spore cell wall integrity after exposure to Mars-like environmental stress, CFUs were quantified for A. niger grown in the presence of an antifungal compound that acts on the cell wall (caspofungin) and a cell wall stressor (calcofluor white). Spore suspensions from the three exposure conditions (desiccated lab control, UV shielded bottom layer, and UV exposed top layer) and fresh spores (as non-desiccated control) were serially diluted in a 96-well plate. For each dilution (10–1 to 10–5), 5 μL were spotted on MM nutrient agar supplemented with 0.75 μg mL–1 caspofungin diacetate (Sigma) or 40 μg mL–1 calcofluor white (Sigma), and incubated for 2–4 days at 30°C. Statistical Analysis Survival, metabolic activity and germination data were plotted as mean values using SigmaPlot (Version 13.0, Systat Software). Error bars are presented as standard error (SE). Student’s t-test and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test were performed with Mean + SE to identify significant differences between each two tested conditions, per microorganism. A two-tailed p-value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. ANOVA analysis was also performed on survival data. A summary of t-test and ANOVA analysis of survival data can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–3.",
    "results": "Results Middle Stratosphere as a Mars Analog Environment This study exposed different microorganisms (Aspergillus niger, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Salinisphaera shabanensis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9) to a Mars analog environment. The robust simulation of Mars environmental conditions was made possible with access to Earth’s middle stratosphere onboard a scientific balloon flight, where combined conditions include elevated non-ionizing and ionizing radiation doses, low temperature, and extreme desiccation. Additionally, samples were flown inside a Trex-Box container with Mars gas composition (mostly CO2) and surface atmospheric pressure (5–10 mbar). Onboard the MARSBOx payload, microbial samples were exposed as dried cells or spores desiccated on quartz disks in two different layers: a bottom layer that was shielded from UV radiation, and a top layer that was exposed to stratospheric UV conditions. Table 3 summarizes the environmental conditions in the balloon flight compared to the generalized equatorial surface of Mars based on available measurements and models. TABLE 3.

M-42 Ionizing Radiation Data In the following sub-section, we will only provide a snapshot of the data measured with the M-42 instrument to demonstrate proof of operations during the mission. In Figure 5, we provide the count rate of the silicon diode for the whole time the system was powered. The count rate plot shows the crossings of the Regener maximum (Regener and Pfotzer, 1935), during ascent and descent of the balloon. At cruising altitude, we saw a nearly constant count rate which results in a dose rate of 75.5 ± 13 μGy per day. In total we measured a dose of 20.9 μGy for the whole mission, which is equivalent to around 10 days of natural background radiation received in the DLR laboratory in Cologne. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab The M-42 count rate (cts min–1) measured for the MARSBOx balloon flight mission. Stratospheric Sunlight Reduced Microbial Survival Figure 6 summarizes survival fractions for exposed microorganisms in the balloon experiment. Spores from the filamentous fungus A. niger showed the highest endurance to the combined stresses of stratospheric radiation and simulated martian atmospheric and temperature conditions during the MARSBOx flight (Figure 6D). The extremophilic bacterium S. shabanensis tolerated desiccation but showed a decrease in survival in the UV-exposed layer of the Trex-Box (Figure 6B). The human-associated S. capitis subsp. capitis also displayed sensitivity to UV exposure, with only cells from the UV-shielded bottom layer surviving the flight experiment (i.e., still exposed to Mars gas, desiccation and temperature fluctuation). It should be noted that the laboratory control cells of S. capitis subsp. capitis, kept desiccated under oxic conditions, were not revivable. Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 showed no growth, even in the laboratory controls; consequently, stratosphere exposure effects could not be determined for this microorganism. FIGURE 6.

(C,D) A. niger spores in monolayer (C) and in multilayer (D). Data for Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 are not shown, since no surviving cells were recovered after exposure. Survival and Metabolic Activity of Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis For S. capitis subsp. capitis, the average of three samples (n = 3) from flight conditions and six samples (n = 6) from the laboratory control are shown in Figure 6A. In the UV-exposed samples and the laboratory controls, no surviving cells could be detected via determination of CFU mL–1. The UV-shielded samples showed a significant reduction of the survival fraction by three orders of magnitude (p = 0.03). Metabolic activity was detected in UV-shielded (bottom layer) and UV-exposed (top layer) samples, but not in the laboratory controls. Metabolic activity in the UV-exposed cells was delayed in comparison to UV-shielded cells (Figure 7A). UV-shielded cells reached the maximum reduction of resazurin (70%) after 28 h of incubation, whereas in UV-exposed cells, the resazurin reduction was still below 70% after 44 h (total incubation time). FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Metabolic activity upon revival, after exposure to Mars simulated conditions aboard the MARSBOx payload. Metabolic activity is depicted as percentage of reduced resazurin.

MASE-IM-9, the survivability of cells dried in medium or buffer was evaluated. This strain did not survive laboratory controls or the MARSBOx flight samples. Similarly, with resazurin assay no metabolic activity was detected for Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, in any of the samples. Survival and Metabolic Activity of Salinisphaera shabanensis No survival differences between S. shabanensis cells dried in medium and S. shabanensis cells dried in buffer were observed. Therefore, the average of six samples (n = 6) was reported in Figure 6. While S. shabanensis was able to endure 5 months of desiccation, there was still an overall reduction of four orders of magnitude (laboratory control, Figure 6B). The survival for the laboratory control and the UV-shielded cells was similar (p = 0.725), with UV exposure further reducing the survival fraction (p = 0.602) (Figure 6B). These results were supported by the metabolic activity assay with resazurin reduction in both laboratory controls and flown UV-shielded cells (Figure 7B). Survival and Metabolic Activity of Aspergillus niger Spores Compared to other microorganisms evaluated in our experiment, A. niger spores were the most resistant to all tested conditions (Figure 6). Two different A. niger spore concentrations were tested in the Trex-Box: 107 spores mL–1 (spore monolayer) and 108 spores mL–1 (spore multilayer); n = 3 for each concentration (Figure 1). Survival of UV-exposed spores was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to laboratory controls, in both spore monolayer (p = 0.001) and spore multilayer (p = 0.001). Survival of UV-shielded spores, i.e., still exposed to Mars gas, pressure and temperature, was not affected, when compared to laboratory controls, in either the monolayer (p = 0.592) or multilayer (p = 0.495) concentration (Figures 6C,D, respectively). When assessing the time taken to reach the maximum of metabolic activity, UV-exposed monolayer spores were delayed by 48% (peaking only after 43 h of incubation) when compared with laboratory control (peaking after 29 h of incubation); and multilayer spores were delayed by 38% (peaking only after 36 h of incubation) when compared with laboratory control (peaking after 26 h of incubation) as shown in Figures 7C,D, respectively. Spore germination was delayed by 22% in UV-exposed spores, being detected only after 27 h, versus 22 h of laboratory control. Germination rate was significantly lower in UV-exposed when compared to UV-shielded spores (p = 0.01 monolayer; p < 0.001 multilayer) and when compared to laboratory controls (p = 0.03 monolayer; p = 0.08 multilayer) (Figure 8). UV-shielded spores showed decreased ability to cope with cell wall stress (1 order of magnitude; whereas UV-exposed spores were shown to be highly sensitive to cell wall stress, 2 or more orders of magnitude) (Figure 9). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab (A) Germination rate (G/NG) of A. niger spores after exposure to simulated Mars conditions.

In UV-shielded martian-like conditions, the presence of a multilayer was shown to significantly decrease survival (p = 0.01) (Figure 6) and germination rate (p = 0.004) (Figure 8), but to significantly increase metabolic activity (p = 0.02) (Figure 7). In UV-exposed, Mars-like conditions, the presence of a spore multilayer did not affect survival (p = 0.5) or germination rate (p = 0.1); but was shown to increase metabolic activity (p = 0.04). Multilayer spores were significantly faster in reaching the metabolic maximum than monolayer spores, in all tested conditions (Table 4). TABLE 4.

    "discussion": "Discussion Relevance to Space Biology and Astrobiology In this study, bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to Mars-like environmental conditions onboard the MARSBOx payload during a 7 h balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km). The tested microorganisms (Aspergillus niger, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Salinisphaera shabanensis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9) were chosen based on astrobiology and space biology relevance. Moreover, the choice of these strains was to provide a representative set of samples that are capable of demonstrating the MARSBOx experimental design as a valuable martian analog for future investigations. To test the hypothesis that isolates from extreme Mars-analog environments on Earth would be able to survive the MARSBOx simulated martian conditions, two extremophilic bacteria were included. The bacterium S. shabanensis is a halophile isolated from the brine–seawater interface of the Shaban Deep at a depth of 1.3 km where the maximal salinity reaches 26% (Eder et al., 2002). Deep-sea brine pools have been identified as martian analogs in regards to the salinity and water activity in brines (Antunes, 2020). On the surface of Mars, brines might remain liquid at ultra-low temperatures (Toner and Catling, 2016). In addition to high salinity, the martian surface lacks oxygen and nutrients. For these reasons, the Gram-(-) bacterium, Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, isolated from an anoxic, nutrient-limited, and sulphidic martian analog spring in Germany (Cockell et al., 2018), was also included in our study. An emerging body of evidence shows that spores from the fungus A. niger can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., radiation, heat, low water activity, etc.) (Singaravelan et al., 2008; Esbelin et al., 2013; Segers et al., 2018; Cortesão et al., 2020a), probably due to the roles of pigmentation, cell wall structure, and metabolic suppression, which might enable them to survive space travel on the outer surfaces of a spacecraft, and to thrive within the spacecraft’s controlled habitat. Alarmingly, the inhalation of A. niger spores may cause respiratory diseases, especially when in closed indoor habitats such as the ISS, which facilitate spore dispersal (Silverman et al., 1967; Latge, 1999; Esbelin et al., 2013; Cortesão et al., 2020a, b). This motivates further study on how the species responds to spaceflight conditions, and consequent implications for astronaut health, in particular in long-term space missions. Moreover, on Earth, A. niger is used in biotechnology to produce a wide-range of useful compounds including citric acid, antibiotics, and enzymes (Meyer et al., 2011; Cairns et al., 2018). Consequently, A. niger could play an important role in human space exploration as long-duration, far-reaching, missions may require biomanufacturing and resource-independence from Earth (Silverman et al., 1967; Latge, 1999; Esbelin et al., 2013; Cortesão et al., 2020a, b). Finally, S. capitis is a Gram-(+) bacterium commonly associated as a commensal species on human skin (Byrd et al., 2018). However, S. capitis also has the ability to cause infections in neonates and form biofilms on implants (de Silva et al., 2002; Cui et al., 2013). The Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis strain K1-2-2-23 (DSM 111179) used in this study was isolated aboard the ISS within an indoor exposure experiment (Sobisch et al., 2019). Its occurrence in crewed space stations, the clinical relevance and the phylogenetic proximity to other clinically relevant staphylococcal species make S. capitis a useful model organism to study the effects of space conditions on opportunistic human pathogens, and to identify potential risks of crew infection (Xiao et al., 2019). Radiation Levels in the Middle Stratosphere Life on Earth is protected from low-wavelength UV radiation (100–280 nm) by atmospheric ozone (Horneck et al., 2010). Above the concentration of atmospheric ozone, where large scientific balloon missions float, UV radiation levels nearly match those expected on the surface of equatorial Mars. For instance, Caro et al. (2019) recently measured an average instantaneous UVA-UVB flux of ∼6 mW cm−2 on a meteorological balloon mission flown to the middle stratosphere; the total combined dose measured was 1.9 kJ. In comparison, ∼5 mW cm–2 was the reported value to be expected at the surface of Mars for UVA-UVB according to calculations from Schuerger et al. (2003). Surprisingly few UVC measurements have been obtained for Earth’s middle stratosphere but Caro et al. (2019) modeled an expected range of 0.1–1 μW cm–2 for altitudes above the ozone layer. Besides intense UV radiation (derived levels in this study), we measured ionizing radiation in the middle stratosphere with the M-42 active dosimeter. This was the first successful M-42 flight test in preparation for the dosimetry suite onboard the upcoming Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment on the NASA Artemis I mission (Berger et al., 2019). At the ∼38 km float altitude on the MARSBOx mission, the dose rate was almost constant, around 75.5 ± 13 μGy day–1. In comparison, the dose rate measured on the surface of Mars for the same time period would approach 260 μGy day–1. A more comprehensive radiation biophysics analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo calculations) will be reported later alongside additional balloon flight measurements from a joint NASA-DLR long-duration Antarctic mission flown in December 2019. In the meantime, we point readers interested in the ionizing radiation levels of the middle stratosphere over New Mexico to the RaD-X mission results from Mertens (2016). Bacterial Survival The endurance of S. shabanensis, a non-pigmented halophile, to the (derived) UV dose of 1148 kJ m–2 during the balloon flight was unanticipated considering the original isolation source for the species was a deep-sea brine pool with no direct illumination from sunlight. Our stratosphere balloon mission results for S. shabanensis (partial resistance to UV exposure) reveal a wide variability in UV response based on the model bacterium studied. It was previously reported that even vegetative Escherichia coli cells can persist for 7 days under simulated Mars conditions, even when exposed to 8 h of UVC irradiation (200–280 nm) at a fluence of 3.6 W m–2 per day (Berry et al., 2010). Besides innate physiological differences, survival rates might also be influenced by the degree to which the UV dose was attenuated. With past laboratory- and flight-based experiments embedding microorganisms in different substrates – including Mars analog soils – the effects of UV (alone) can be difficult to assess (Rettberg et al., 2004; Wadsworth and Cockell, 2017). Cell layering (discussed later in section “A. niger spores survive Mars-like conditions”) also likely plays a role in variable survival outcomes, as reported with past stratosphere exposure studies (Khodadad et al., 2017). We expected S. capitis subsp. capitis to be more tolerant to radiation in the stratosphere because of its natural occurrence on human skin (Byrd et al., 2018), where direct illumination from sunlight would be common. For instance, the average UV dose causing erythema (abnormal redness of the skin) of Americans is approximately 25 kJ m–2 per year (Godar et al., 2001). Whether the tested bacterial strains would be able to survive in a real Mars-surface environment depends on various aspects; however, access to UV-shielding will certainly play a major role. This was seen in our study, as both the halophilic bacterium S. shabanensis, and the human skin associated bacterium S. capitis subsp. capitis survived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight. In the event that these bacteria are brought to Mars, either in robotic missions for astrobiological research purposes; or by accident through crew-led contamination in space missions (Avila-Herrera et al., 2020) our results suggest that bacterial bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time (>5 h). Bacterial Desiccation Tolerance in Mars-Like Conditions Desiccation can be a stressful condition for cells, where the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and irreversible changes in lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids can lead to death (Cox, 1993; Dose and Gill, 1995). Some microorganisms can tolerate extreme desiccation by ceasing metabolic activity in a state of anhydrobiosis (Glasheen and Hand, 1988; Wright, 1989; Potts, 1994). Our results for the bacterial species S. shabanensis showed survival under long-term desiccation and sunlight exposed flight conditions. The survival for the laboratory control and the UV-shielded organisms are similar, which may indicate a desiccation sensitivity of this strain. Cells of S. capitis subsp. capitis K1-2-2-23 were inactivated from the flight UV-exposure but did partially survive the UV-shielded layer of the Trex-Box. Interestingly, the desiccated laboratory controls for S. capitis subsp. capitis did not survive the experiment, indicating that long-term resistance to desiccation was only possible when cells were under the Mars-like atmosphere and not when kept in Earth atmosphere. The results from the balloon flight warrant further investigation to determine if a Mars gas mixture has an impact on the stability of some bacterial species. For instance, it is known that the presence of oxygen can decrease the survivability of prokaryotes during desiccation (Potts, 1994; Vriezen et al., 2007; Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017b) and in additional experiments we observed that the survival of S. capitis subsp. capitis K1-2-2-23 increased when desiccation occurred in anoxic conditions (data not shown). Finally, the last bacterial species flown in this experiment, Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, did not survive long-term desiccation. Therefore, no surviving cells could be detected in the balloon flight samples or from laboratory controls. This negative result was consistent with previous Mars analog experiments where Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, a facultative anaerobe, survived a maximum of 3 months of desiccation (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2018, 2020). A. niger Spores Survive Mars-Like Conditions While bacterial cells were sensitive to UV exposure in the middle stratosphere, in addition to long-term desiccation, A. niger spores were highly resistant to all tested conditions. Laboratory controls demonstrated A. niger spore endurance to 5-month desiccation, when air-dried and kept at room temperature (22°C) at the bench, under Earth atmospheric conditions. Spores of A. niger shielded from UV (bottom layer) endured a 5-month desiccation within Mars-like atmosphere and pressure, with additional exposure to extreme temperature fluctuations during the balloon flight (−51°C to +21°C). Finally, spores of A. niger exposed to UV (top layer) withstood over 5 h of full simulation of Mars environmental conditions, i.e., exposed to Mars gas, atmosphere, temperature fluctuation, and to a total estimated UVA-UVB dose of 1148 kJ m–2 during the balloon flight. A previous study testing A. niger spore survival to desiccation and solar radiation was done in an experimental setting similar to this study: A. niger spore monolayers were dried in glass disks and exposed to ∼16 kJ m–2 of UVB (280–320 nm); the specimens were highly resistant, with 24% ± 5% survival (Dose et al., 2001). The extraordinarily high level of resistance of A. niger spores to UVC radiation (LD90 value of 1038 J m–2) has been previously reported by Cortesão et al. (2020a). Another balloon-flown study (i.e., same launch site and season; different year) with pigmented spores of the fungus Fuligo spectica showed that these remained viable after a 9 h exposure to conditions in the stratosphere (Díez et al., 2020). In the Aspergillus genus, secondary metabolites e.g., DHN-melanin (a pigment) and fumiquinazoline might be associated with UV protection roles (Blachowicz et al., 2020). The ubiquitous presense of A. niger spores in human indoor-closed habitats, and their high resistance to outer space conditions, suggests these will likely travel with us to Mars. A contamination scenario, several factors might affect the survivability potential of A. niger spores in a Mars-surface environment. Some are intrinsic to the spores, e.g., molecular mechanisms such as DNA repair systems; or structural protection mechanisms such as the thick cell wall (Latgé et al., 2017). Whereas other factors are external, for instance, shielding from the spacecraft surfaces or martian regolith. An important factor known to impact survival outcomes is the starting cell concentration (Khodadad et al., 2017). To test this, we compared A. niger responses to the stratosphere as either a spore monolayer (107 spores ml–1) or a spore multilayer (108 spores ml–1) (Table 4). When exposed to UV-shielded conditions, a higher starting spore concentration (multilayer) influenced all primary measures (i.e., survival fraction, spore germination, and metabolic activity). Unexpectedly, spores in a multilayer yielded a decreased survival in laboratory controls and UV shielded conditions, as well as a decreased germination rate in all tested conditions, when compared with spores in a monolayer. These discrepancies might simply be due to incomplete removal of biomass from the quartz disks or due to the presence of hyphae fusion in germination test plates; either of which could lead to undercounting. Moreover, in A. niger spores, the cell wall is a highly complex structure that plays an important role in protecting the spores from extracellular environmental stress. The spore cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides (α-glucans β-glucans), galactomannan, and chitin; and is surrounded by a rodlet layer with hydrophobic surface proteins, and a melanin layer. When germinating into vegetative cells (hyphae), the spore cell wall is remodeled and no longer provides protection to extreme conditions (Latgé et al., 2017). Considering environmental changes typically act first on the cell wall, we evaluated how Mars-like conditions might alter A. niger spore cell wall integrity. All tested spores were able to revive (i.e., germinate) and grow in media supplemented with cell wall stressors: calcofluor white or caspofungin. Calcofluor white is a non-specific fluorochrom that can bind to 1,3- and 1,4-β polysaccharides on chitin and cellulose, inhibiting chitin microfibril assembly and cell wall integrity (Fiedler et al., 2014).",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion To date, a variety of terrestrial analogs and simulation chambers have been used to predict outcomes for microbial exposure to Mars-like conditions. Most often, such investigations use elevated radiation and desiccation paired with low pressure and temperature alongside a Mars gas mixture (Jensen et al., 2008; Schuerger et al., 2008; Motamedi et al., 2015). However, few studies can simultaneously recreate a multi-factor Mars environment. The renewed focus on Mars robotic and human exploration e.g., Mars 2020, Mars Sample Return (NASA, 2020) and ExoMars 2022 (ESA, 2020) amplifies the need for additional Mars analog studies in the coming years. In this study we: •reported the use of a new scientific payload (MARSBOx) for stratospheric balloon missions allowing access to a wide-ranging Mars analog environment with natural ionizing and non-ionizing radiation; •demonstrated a successful experimental set-up, of the Trex-Box and MARSBOx combined, where four different microorganisms could be tested, in dried conditions, throughout a 5-month period, without cross-contaminations. •showed that the extremophilic bacterium S. shabanensis and the human skin-associated bacterium S. capitis subsp. capitis survived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight, suggesting that bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time; •revealed that highly pigmented spores from the fungus A. niger would survive, in a Mars-like middle stratosphere environment for > 5 h of UV exposure, even as a spore monolayer (106 spores mL−1), i.e., with no self-shielding. Taken together, we conclude pigmented fungal spores might be considered some of the most likely forward contaminants to survive if inadvertently delivered to Mars. Our results underscore the importance of including fungal spores in Mars forward contamination studies and relevant planetary protection policies, which currently restrict surface bioburden of ≤3 × 105 bacterial endospores for robotic lander systems that are not carrying instruments to investigate extant martian life (category IVa) (COSPAR, 2020). Moreover, fungal spore sensitivity to extreme heat or to high doses of combined sources of space radiation, as well as to other factors that affect survivability (e.g., regolith reactive compounds or regolith shielding), should be further evaluated to better assess the forward contamination potential in Mars analog environments.",

Copyright notice ID: 7937622 PMID: 33692763 Abstract Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m−2) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(–) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions. Keywords: Mars simulation, fungal spores, spore survival, space, radiation, UV, balloon flight, stress resistanceIntroduction Mariner IV was the first successful robotic mission to Mars producing surface photos and preliminary data used to model atmospheric pressure, layer heights, and temperature (Leighton et al., 1965; Binder, 1966; Fjeldbo and Eshleman, 1968). In the half century since that first pioneering mission, orbital and surface rover missions have continued to characterize the Mars environment – generally regarded as hostile to terrestrial life as we know it. The martian surface features highly desiccating conditions as well as extremely low pressure and temperature. Moreover, lacking a substantial atmosphere and with a weak magnetosphere (Acuña et al., 2001), non-ionizing UV radiation (100–400 nm) as well as high energy solar ionizing radiation (X-rays, Gamma rays, etc.) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) bombard the planet’s surface (Kuhn and Atreya, 1979; Simonsen et al., 1990; Saganti et al., 2004; Hellweg and Baumstark-Khan, 2007; Barlow, 2008; Catling, 2009; Hassler et al., 2014; Martínez et al., 2017). With such an extreme radiation environment, from a terrestrial standpoint, the martian surface appears to be biocidal. To ascertain where life can survive beyond Earth, experiments in the fields of space biology and astrobiology have examined the responses of terrestrial model organisms to simulated and real space conditions (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001; Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2016; DasSarma et al., 2020). Understanding microbial adaptations to either isolated and combined extreme environmental stressors helps (i) establish the limits of life on Earth as we know it; (ii) determine whether terrestrial life could survive on Mars; and (iii) refine the search for life in other extraterrestrial habitats (Horneck et al., 2010; Cockell et al., 2016). With the possible exception of the Viking missions, Mars has been unavailable to date for conducting controlled biological experiments; thus, extreme terrestrial analog environments have been widely used to test instrumentation and microbial survival outcomes (Marlow et al., 2008; Fairén et al., 2010; Suedfeld, 2010; West et al., 2010). Typically, martian analog environments are located on Earth’s surface in regions where aridity, temperature extremes, and elevated radiation dominate the landscape. For instance, the McMurdo Dry Valleys in continental Antarctica and high-elevation deserts in Australia and South America are frequently visited, analog destinations (Clarke and Persaud, 2004; Fletcher et al., 2012; López-Lozano et al., 2012; Heldmann et al., 2013; Musilova et al., 2015). However, high above Earth’s surface in the stratosphere (∼15–50 km), another Mars analog environment exists, presenting a unique combination of environmental insults that more closely resemble conditions on the Red Planet. In the middle stratosphere during daytime hours, the following Mars-like factors are simultaneously present: intense, full spectrum ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high energy ionizing radiation (including secondary scattering), desiccation, hypoxia, and ultralow temperatures and pressures (Clark and McCoy, 1965; Potemra and Zmuda, 1970; Vampola and Gorney, 1983; Keating et al., 1987; Clancy and Muhleman, 1993; Von Engeln et al., 1998; Seele and Hartogh, 1999; Shepherd, 2000; Lambert et al., 2007; Mertens et al., 2016; Caro et al., 2019). Taken together, these combined conditions cannot be found naturally anywhere on the surface of the Earth and would be challenging to easily reproduce in laboratory-based experiments. Reaching the middle stratosphere is relatively achievable compared to suborbital and orbital spaceflight investigations. High-altitude scientific balloons have been used for more than eight decades to study the atmosphere and atmospheric phenomena (Winckler et al., 1959; Winckler, 1960; Murcray et al., 1969; Mertens et al., 2016; Caro et al., 2019) and more recently for conducting biological exposure experiments (Stevens, 1936; Simons, 1954; Sullivan and Smith, 1960; Rainwater and Smith, 2004; Beck-Winchatz and Bramble, 2014; Coleman and Mitchell, 2014; Smith et al., 2014; Khodadad et al., 2017; Smith and Sowa, 2017; Pulschen et al., 2018). In this study, we take advantage of a large scientific balloon mission to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) for exposing microorganisms and measuring their survival and metabolic responses while monitoring ionizing radiation levels and other pertinent environmental conditions. Four microorganisms relevant to astrobiology and space biology were flown inside the Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment (MARSBOx) payload. The two bacterial extremophiles, Salinisphaera shabanensis and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, were included to test the hypothesis that terrestrial microbial strains, isolated from extreme Mars-analog environments, can withstand the stress factors of a martian-like environment. The fungus Aspergillus niger and the bacterium Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis were included in this study because they are human-associated and opportunistic pathogens, and have both been previously detected on the International Space Station (ISS). Thus, they are likely to travel to Mars in crewed space missions (Novikova et al., 2006; Checinska et al., 2015; Be et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019). Moreover, spores from A. niger might resist space travel on the outside of a spacecraft; therefore, understanding their survival potential in a Mars-like environment is of interest to planetary protection. The MARSBOx design was a balloon-compatible, NASA-adapted version of hardware from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) biological exposure missions EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R aboard the ISS (Rabbow et al., 2009; Rabbow et al., 2012, 2015), using the transport and exposure box (Trex-Box) from the European MASE project (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a). To adjust for Mars atmospheric conditions, the Trex-Box was filled with a Mars gas mixture at 5–10 mbar during the mission. Herein, we report results from the first MARSBOx mission and summarize environmental conditions that collectively indicate the most robust Mars analog.Materials and Methods Test Organisms, Media, and Sample Preparation for Flight A summary of the microorganisms used in this study can be found in Table 1. Aspergillus niger (N402) spores were harvested after 3 days of incubation at 30°C from complete medium agar plates [CM; composition: 55 mM glucose, 11 mM KH2PO4, 7 mM KCl, 178 nM H3BO3, 2 mM MgSO4, 76 nM ZnSO4, 70 mM NaNO3, 6.2 nM Na2MoO4, 18 nM FeSO4, 7.1 nM CoCl2, 6.4 nM CuSO4, 25 nM MnCl2, 174 nM EDTA; 0.5% (w v–1) yeast extract and 0.1% (w v–1) casamino acids, 15 g agar per Liter] by flooding the plates with sterile, saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and gently scraping the spores out using a cotton stick.

Titer determination was done using an improved Neubauer cell count chamber on vortexed suspensions; 20 μL of spores were then spotted onto round quartz disks (6 mm ∅, 1 mm thickness; MolTech) in triplicate and left to dry at room temperature (22°C) on the bench. Two spore concentrations were prepared for the MARSBOx flight: 1 × 107 spores mL–1 (spore monolayer) and 1 × 108 spores mL–1 (spore multilayer). Presence of spore multilayer and monolayer was determined qualitatively with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6510, Jeol), operated at 10 Kv (Figure 1). Further experiments using agar plates were done with minimal medium (composition: 55 mM glucose, 11 mM KH2PO4, 7 mM KCl, 178 nM H3BO3, 2 mM MgSO4, 76 nM ZnSO4, 70 mM NaNO3, 6.2 nM Na2MoO4, 18 nM FeSO4, 7.1 nM CoCl2, 6.4 nM CuSO4, 25 nM MnCl2, 174 nM EDTA, 15 g agar, per Liter). FIGURE 1.

Stationary phase cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm) in 40 mL culture for 5 min. Cells were washed by removal of the supernatant, resuspension of the pellet in 40 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS; composition: Na2HPO4 7.0 g, KH2PO4 3.0 g, NaCl 4.0 g, per Liter, pH 7.5), and centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The washing step was repeated once and after the last centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mL PBS. Thirty μL of this concentrated cell suspension were pipetted onto the quartz disks and left to dry at room temperature (22°C) on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on tryptic soy agar (TSA; composition: tryptone 17.0 g, soy peptone 3.0 g, glucose 2.5 g, NaCl 5.0 g, K2HPO4 2.5 g, agar 15 g, per Liter) to be 1.4 × 109 cells per disk, resulting in a multilayer of bacterial cells. The facultative anaerobes, Salinisphaera shabanensis and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, were cultivated in liquid microoxic Marine Broth (BD Difco; composition: peptone 5.0 g, yeast extract 1.0 g ferric citrate 0.1 g, NaCl 19.45 g, MgCl2 5.9 g, MgSO4 3.24 g, CaCl2 1.8 g, KCl 0.55 g, NaHCO3 0.16 g, KBr, 0.08 g, SrCl2 34.0 mg, boric acid 22.0 mg, Na4SiO4 4.0 mg, NaF 2.4 mg, NH4NO3 1.6 mg, and Na2HPO4 8.0 mg, per Liter) and microoxic TSB, respectively, in sterile serum bottles with headspace pressure and gas composition of ∼1,010 mbar and N2/CO2 (80/20 v/v), respectively. Cell concentration was determined via cell counting in a Thoma counting chamber. Stationary phase cells from an overnight culture of each strain were harvested by centrifugation (14,500 g) of 1 mL culture for 15 min. To assess possible differences in survival between cells dried in medium (UV absorption of medium components) or dried in non-absorbing buffer, after the centrifugation step either (i) 950 μL of the supernatant were removed, cells were resuspended in the remaining growth media, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk; or (ii) cells were washed with 1 mL PBS (for S. shabanensis the NaCl content was adjusted to 10%), again centrifuged for 15 min at 14,100 g, the supernatant (950 μL) was removed, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk. The desiccation process was conducted under oxic conditions on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on Marine agar/TSA to be ∼108 cells per disk for both strains.Balloon Payload The MARSBOx payload (38.1 cm × 25.4 cm × 63.5 cm; mass 18 kg) was built for simple mounting and integration onto the exterior of large scientific balloon gondolas (Figure 2). Biological samples were enclosed within a pressurized, shielded container (Trex-Box) (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a) with a rotatable shutter that prevented solar radiation exposure during ascent and descent (i.e., experimental initiation/termination). Covering the Trex-Box was suprasil glass: 8 mm thick, with a long pass cut off of ∼170 nm (with 0% transmission), and magnesium fluoride (MgF2), with a long pass cut off of ∼110 nm (custom made by MolTech, Germany) (Figure 3B). During the balloon flight, the MARSBOx system controlled the exposure to UV radiation so that the samples were only exposed at stratosphere altitudes [Figure 4 and Supplementary Videos 1 (ascent), 2 (descent)]. Motors, gears, and the shutter were held together by a frame composed of aluminum cutouts and 3D-printed polycarbonate-ABS components. T-slotted 80/20 aluminum extrusions formed the framework of the payload, with detachable, white powder-coated aluminum panels on each face of the MARSBOx. Angle brackets on the back plate were used to mount the system onto the balloon gondola. The front panel data port contained one micro-USB port, six light emitting diodes (LEDs), and two key switches. One key switch was used to power on the system and the other was used to manually rotate the shutter lid (for loading and removing Trex-Box with samples). The LEDs were programmed to indicate the state of the onboard computer’s health (OSD3358, Octavo Systems) and the status of the computer’s state machine, GPS receiver (GPS_FGPMMOPA6H, Adafruit Industries), camera system (Hero4 Black, GOPRO with Dash controller, CamDo), heater system, and the M-42 radiation dosimeter (Berger et al., 2019).

(B) Balloon flight path; stars mark opening and closing of the Trex-Box lid, which corresponds to UV-VIS radiation exposure beginning and ending.Other major payload components included three pressure sensors (MS5803, MEAS Switzerland; AMS5812, Analog Microelectronics; and BMP085, Bosch Sensortec), four temperature sensors, and a 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). While not flown on this mission, MARSBOx can carry additional instruments (e.g., UV radiometers) located behind the front panel of the payload. For the LDB #697NT flight, power was provided by a 14.8v 25.2 Ah lithium-ion polymer battery (CU-J141, BatterySpace) fastened in place with an ultem 3-D printed battery holder. The MARSBOx payload can also utilize a direct connection to the balloon gondola power source with an acceptable input range of 9V – 36V. The design and technical details of the Trex-Box were previously described in detail (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a). Briefly, the design of the aluminum box was inspired by the EXPOSE mission series on the ISS (Rabbow et al., 2012; Rabbow et al., 2015) using a Trex-Box to control the transport of microorganisms during experiments (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a, 2020). The Trex-Box can be filled with gas and sealed, allowing for a sustained martian gas composition of 0.17% O2, 95% CO2, 0.07% CO, 2.6% N2, and 1.9% Ar during the course of the experiment at Mars-like pressures (∼7 mbar) (Figures 3C,D). The Trex-Box enabled testing of four different microorganisms without cross-contamination (an issue reported in past balloon experiments; see Díez et al., 2020) because each organism was set in one of the four quarter sections of each layer (Figure 3A).Stratospheric Flight Experiment The Trex-Box consisted of two layers of an aluminum 64-well sample carrier, each holding quartz disks with microbial samples (see section “Test organisms, media, and sample preparation for flight”) that were either exposed to direct stratospheric UV radiation (UV-exposed, top layer) or shielded from UV (UV-shielded, bottom layer) (Table 2). The quartz disks were glued into the sample carrier using the biocompatible Vulcanizing Adhesive for Spaceflight Experiments (Wacker Chemie AG, certified by ECSS – European Cooperation for Space Standardization). For each experimental group, three quartz disks were used as ground laboratory controls and remained in normal atmospheric conditions at room temperature (22°C) on the bench until analysis (Table 2).

During the 5-month experimental duration, both flight and control samples were kept desiccated on quartz disks. Table 2 provides an overview of the conditions microbial samples experienced in this study.Estimated UV Radiation Dose The total UV dose [J m–2] that the samples were exposed to during the MARSBOx mission was calculated as follows: Dose(Jm)-2=[Fluence(mWcm)-2×Time(s)]×10 where UV fluence [mW cm–2] values for UVA-UVB (280–400 nm) in the middle stratosphere were taken from a previous flight = 6 mW cm–2 (Caro et al., 2019), and sample exposure time [in seconds] = 19140 s. Samples were exposed to an estimated total of 1148 kJ m–2 of UVA-UVB radiation. Previously modeled UVC (206–280 nm) values by Caro et al. (2019) ranged from about 0.1–1 μW cm−2 for the altitude flown during the MARSBOx mission (∼38 km).Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry: M-42 In order to determine the ionizing radiation environment during the flight, a miniaturized, low-power consumption radiation detector system (M-42) was included onboard the MARSBOx payload. The M-42 instrument (size: 142 mm × 38 mm × 13 mm) was developed at DLR and can actively measure the absorbed dose using a silicon detector diode (Berger et al., 2019). Two batteries allow the M-42 to operate as a stand-alone radiation detector system, but for the MARSBOx flight the instrument was externally powered through the in-built micro-USB connector. Upon launch of the balloon, power was provided and the M-42 started taking measurements. Data were stored every 5 min on a non-volatile flash memory and upon landing the instrument was switched off.Balloon Flight Profile One week before flying, the MARSBOx hardware (without biological specimens loaded) was tested in a hypobaric chamber at the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (Palestine, TX, United States) to validate system performance and commands. The payload was then transported to the launch site at Ft. Sumner, NM, United States (lat 34.49° long −104.2°), where it was mounted onto the top portion of the LDB #697NT gondola. After installation and prior to launch, the payload surface was sprayed with sterile air and wiped down with isopropyl alcohol. The mission carrying the MARSBOx payload was launched on 23 September 2019 at 1400 UTC, with a full video replay of the flight available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8qx_0FmV0. The balloon ascended for 2.5 h until reaching an average float altitude of 38.2 km where it remained for 4 h, followed by a 35-min descent on parachute, landing 172 km west of the launch site (lat 35.29° long −105.1°). Sample exposure began during ascent at 21.4 km with the Trex-Box shutter opening at 1521 UTC and concluded 5 h and 19 min later with the Trex-Box shutter closing during descent at 22.0 km at 2040 UTC (Figure 4). The M-42 dosimeter was turned on at 1405 UTC when the payload was at 3.07 km and remained on until 2119 UTC at 1.75 km above the balloon landing site. Personnel from CSBF recovered the payload on 24 September 2019 and transported it back to the launch site facility inside a climate-controlled vehicle before shipping to NASA KSC at ambient conditions. Three weeks later, samples and instruments (Trex-Box and M-42) were removed from the MARSBOx payload and shipped to the DLR for post-flight analysis.Post-flight Processing After shipment arrival of the samples at the DLR, the Trex-Box was opened within an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory products) to ensure a constant low relative humidity (<13% relative humidity). The quartz disks harboring dried cells and spores were retrieved from the carrier and placed inside 2 mL Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL PBS respectively. For A. niger spore recovery 2 mm glass beads were added. The tubes were vortexed for 30 s to separate the cells from the disk, and the resulting suspension was used for downstream analyses.Determination of Microbial Survival via Standard Plate Counting The post-flight survival of the tested microorganisms was determined by standard plate counting, where serial dilutions (1:10) were plated on nutrient agar. For bacteria, TSA medium/marine medium was used; for A. niger minimal medium supplemented with 0.05% Triton-X was used. Agar plates were incubated for 1–3 days at 37°C for bacteria and 30°C for fungi. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted, and the colony forming units per mL (CFU mL–1) were calculated. The survival fraction was calculated as N/N0, in which N is the CFU mL–1 after sample retrieval and N0 is the initial cell concentration on the quartz disk. Determination of CFU mL–1 included at least three biological replicates per tested strain (n ≥ 3).Determination of Metabolic Activity via Resazurin Reduction To evaluate the potential for revival after exposure to Mars-like conditions, the metabolic activity of the bacterial cells and fungal spores was measured in a 96-well-plate using resazurin reduction as an indicator (alamarBlueTM Cell Viability Reagent, Thermo FisherTM). In each well there was a total volume of 200 μL (130 μL of media, 50 μL of dilutions, and 20 μL of alamarBlueTM). The media used was dependent on the microorganism tested and is summarized in Table 1. The plate was incubated for 44 h at 30°C. OD600 and OD570 were measured every 30 min in a Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (Infinite M200 PRO, Tecan). Orbital shaking of the plate occurred before each measurement. The percentage of reduced resazurin reagent was calculated according to the standard protocol obtained from Thermo FisherTM.Determination of A. niger Spore Germination To determine the post-flight germination of A. niger spores, spore suspensions (106 spores mL–1) from each tested condition were drop plated (3 μL), in triplicate, on MM agar supplemented with 0.003% yeast extract. Plates were incubated at 22°C for 18–27 h. After incubation, light microscopy was used to quantify the number of germinated (G) and non-germinated (NG) spores. At least 200 spores were counted per replicate. Germination was calculated as the average of the G/NG ratio of each replicate per tested condition.Evaluation of Spore Cell Wall Integrity To test spore cell wall integrity after exposure to Mars-like environmental stress, CFUs were quantified for A. niger grown in the presence of an antifungal compound that acts on the cell wall (caspofungin) and a cell wall stressor (calcofluor white). Spore suspensions from the three exposure conditions (desiccated lab control, UV shielded bottom layer, and UV exposed top layer) and fresh spores (as non-desiccated control) were serially diluted in a 96-well plate. For each dilution (10–1 to 10–5), 5 μL were spotted on MM nutrient agar supplemented with 0.75 μg mL–1 caspofungin diacetate (Sigma) or 40 μg mL–1 calcofluor white (Sigma), and incubated for 2–4 days at 30°C.Statistical Analysis Survival, metabolic activity and germination data were plotted as mean values using SigmaPlot (Version 13.0, Systat Software). Error bars are presented as standard error (SE). Student’s t-test and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test were performed with Mean + SE to identify significant differences between each two tested conditions, per microorganism. A two-tailed p-value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. ANOVA analysis was also performed on survival data. A summary of t-test and ANOVA analysis of survival data can be found in Supplementary Tables 1–3.Results Middle Stratosphere as a Mars Analog Environment This study exposed different microorganisms (Aspergillus niger, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Salinisphaera shabanensis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9) to a Mars analog environment. The robust simulation of Mars environmental conditions was made possible with access to Earth’s middle stratosphere onboard a scientific balloon flight, where combined conditions include elevated non-ionizing and ionizing radiation doses, low temperature, and extreme desiccation. Additionally, samples were flown inside a Trex-Box container with Mars gas composition (mostly CO2) and surface atmospheric pressure (5–10 mbar). Onboard the MARSBOx payload, microbial samples were exposed as dried cells or spores desiccated on quartz disks in two different layers: a bottom layer that was shielded from UV radiation, and a top layer that was exposed to stratospheric UV conditions. Table 3 summarizes the environmental conditions in the balloon flight compared to the generalized equatorial surface of Mars based on available measurements and models. TABLE 3.

M-42 Ionizing Radiation Data In the following sub-section, we will only provide a snapshot of the data measured with the M-42 instrument to demonstrate proof of operations during the mission. In Figure 5, we provide the count rate of the silicon diode for the whole time the system was powered. The count rate plot shows the crossings of the Regener maximum (Regener and Pfotzer, 1935), during ascent and descent of the balloon. At cruising altitude, we saw a nearly constant count rate which results in a dose rate of 75.5 ± 13 μGy per day. In total we measured a dose of 20.9 μGy for the whole mission, which is equivalent to around 10 days of natural background radiation received in the DLR laboratory in Cologne. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab The M-42 count rate (cts min–1) measured for the MARSBOx balloon flight mission.Stratospheric Sunlight Reduced Microbial Survival Figure 6 summarizes survival fractions for exposed microorganisms in the balloon experiment. Spores from the filamentous fungus A. niger showed the highest endurance to the combined stresses of stratospheric radiation and simulated martian atmospheric and temperature conditions during the MARSBOx flight (Figure 6D). The extremophilic bacterium S. shabanensis tolerated desiccation but showed a decrease in survival in the UV-exposed layer of the Trex-Box (Figure 6B). The human-associated S. capitis subsp. capitis also displayed sensitivity to UV exposure, with only cells from the UV-shielded bottom layer surviving the flight experiment (i.e., still exposed to Mars gas, desiccation and temperature fluctuation). It should be noted that the laboratory control cells of S. capitis subsp. capitis, kept desiccated under oxic conditions, were not revivable. Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 showed no growth, even in the laboratory controls; consequently, stratosphere exposure effects could not be determined for this microorganism. FIGURE 6.

(C,D) A. niger spores in monolayer (C) and in multilayer (D). Data for Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 are not shown, since no surviving cells were recovered after exposure.Survival and Metabolic Activity of Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis For S. capitis subsp. capitis, the average of three samples (n = 3) from flight conditions and six samples (n = 6) from the laboratory control are shown in Figure 6A. In the UV-exposed samples and the laboratory controls, no surviving cells could be detected via determination of CFU mL–1. The UV-shielded samples showed a significant reduction of the survival fraction by three orders of magnitude (p = 0.03). Metabolic activity was detected in UV-shielded (bottom layer) and UV-exposed (top layer) samples, but not in the laboratory controls. Metabolic activity in the UV-exposed cells was delayed in comparison to UV-shielded cells (Figure 7A). UV-shielded cells reached the maximum reduction of resazurin (70%) after 28 h of incubation, whereas in UV-exposed cells, the resazurin reduction was still below 70% after 44 h (total incubation time). FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Metabolic activity upon revival, after exposure to Mars simulated conditions aboard the MARSBOx payload. Metabolic activity is depicted as percentage of reduced resazurin. (A) S. shabanensis (B) S. capitis subsp. capitis. (C,D) A. niger spores in monolayer (C) and in multilayer (D).Survival and Metabolic Activity of Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 For Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, the survivability of cells dried in medium or buffer was evaluated. This strain did not survive laboratory controls or the MARSBOx flight samples. Similarly, with resazurin assay no metabolic activity was detected for Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, in any of the samples.Survival and Metabolic Activity of Salinisphaera shabanensis No survival differences between S. shabanensis cells dried in medium and S. shabanensis cells dried in buffer were observed. Therefore, the average of six samples (n = 6) was reported in Figure 6. While S. shabanensis was able to endure 5 months of desiccation, there was still an overall reduction of four orders of magnitude (laboratory control, Figure 6B). The survival for the laboratory control and the UV-shielded cells was similar (p = 0.725), with UV exposure further reducing the survival fraction (p = 0.602) (Figure 6B). These results were supported by the metabolic activity assay with resazurin reduction in both laboratory controls and flown UV-shielded cells (Figure 7B).Survival and Metabolic Activity of Aspergillus niger Spores Compared to other microorganisms evaluated in our experiment, A. niger spores were the most resistant to all tested conditions (Figure 6). Two different A. niger spore concentrations were tested in the Trex-Box: 107 spores mL–1 (spore monolayer) and 108 spores mL–1 (spore multilayer); n = 3 for each concentration (Figure 1). Survival of UV-exposed spores was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to laboratory controls, in both spore monolayer (p = 0.001) and spore multilayer (p = 0.001). Survival of UV-shielded spores, i.e., still exposed to Mars gas, pressure and temperature, was not affected, when compared to laboratory controls, in either the monolayer (p = 0.592) or multilayer (p = 0.495) concentration (Figures 6C,D, respectively). When assessing the time taken to reach the maximum of metabolic activity, UV-exposed monolayer spores were delayed by 48% (peaking only after 43 h of incubation) when compared with laboratory control (peaking after 29 h of incubation); and multilayer spores were delayed by 38% (peaking only after 36 h of incubation) when compared with laboratory control (peaking after 26 h of incubation) as shown in Figures 7C,D, respectively. Spore germination was delayed by 22% in UV-exposed spores, being detected only after 27 h, versus 22 h of laboratory control. Germination rate was significantly lower in UV-exposed when compared to UV-shielded spores (p = 0.01 monolayer; p < 0.001 multilayer) and when compared to laboratory controls (p = 0.03 monolayer; p = 0.08 multilayer) (Figure 8). UV-shielded spores showed decreased ability to cope with cell wall stress (1 order of magnitude; whereas UV-exposed spores were shown to be highly sensitive to cell wall stress, 2 or more orders of magnitude) (Figure 9). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab (A) Germination rate (G/NG) of A. niger spores after exposure to simulated Mars conditions. (B) Light microscopy showing resting spores (red), swollen spores (yellow) and germinated spores (green). Both resting and swollen spores were counted as ungerminated.FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Stress resistance of A. niger towards caspofungin (antifungal compound) and to calcofluor white (cell wall stressor), after spore exposure to simulated martian conditions.Survival, germination, and metabolic activity were compared between spore monolayer and spore multilayer (Table 4). In UV-shielded martian-like conditions, the presence of a multilayer was shown to significantly decrease survival (p = 0.01) (Figure 6) and germination rate (p = 0.004) (Figure 8), but to significantly increase metabolic activity (p = 0.02) (Figure 7). In UV-exposed, Mars-like conditions, the presence of a spore multilayer did not affect survival (p = 0.5) or germination rate (p = 0.1); but was shown to increase metabolic activity (p = 0.04). Multilayer spores were significantly faster in reaching the metabolic maximum than monolayer spores, in all tested conditions (Table 4). TABLE 4.

Discussion Relevance to Space Biology and Astrobiology In this study, bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to Mars-like environmental conditions onboard the MARSBOx payload during a 7 h balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km). The tested microorganisms (Aspergillus niger, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Salinisphaera shabanensis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9) were chosen based on astrobiology and space biology relevance. Moreover, the choice of these strains was to provide a representative set of samples that are capable of demonstrating the MARSBOx experimental design as a valuable martian analog for future investigations. To test the hypothesis that isolates from extreme Mars-analog environments on Earth would be able to survive the MARSBOx simulated martian conditions, two extremophilic bacteria were included. The bacterium S. shabanensis is a halophile isolated from the brine–seawater interface of the Shaban Deep at a depth of 1.3 km where the maximal salinity reaches 26% (Eder et al., 2002). Deep-sea brine pools have been identified as martian analogs in regards to the salinity and water activity in brines (Antunes, 2020). On the surface of Mars, brines might remain liquid at ultra-low temperatures (Toner and Catling, 2016). In addition to high salinity, the martian surface lacks oxygen and nutrients. For these reasons, the Gram-(-) bacterium, Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, isolated from an anoxic, nutrient-limited, and sulphidic martian analog spring in Germany (Cockell et al., 2018), was also included in our study. An emerging body of evidence shows that spores from the fungus A. niger can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., radiation, heat, low water activity, etc.) (Singaravelan et al., 2008; Esbelin et al., 2013; Segers et al., 2018; Cortesão et al., 2020a), probably due to the roles of pigmentation, cell wall structure, and metabolic suppression, which might enable them to survive space travel on the outer surfaces of a spacecraft, and to thrive within the spacecraft’s controlled habitat. Alarmingly, the inhalation of A. niger spores may cause respiratory diseases, especially when in closed indoor habitats such as the ISS, which facilitate spore dispersal (Silverman et al., 1967; Latge, 1999; Esbelin et al., 2013; Cortesão et al., 2020a, b). This motivates further study on how the species responds to spaceflight conditions, and consequent implications for astronaut health, in particular in long-term space missions. Moreover, on Earth, A. niger is used in biotechnology to produce a wide-range of useful compounds including citric acid, antibiotics, and enzymes (Meyer et al., 2011; Cairns et al., 2018). Consequently, A. niger could play an important role in human space exploration as long-duration, far-reaching, missions may require biomanufacturing and resource-independence from Earth (Silverman et al., 1967; Latge, 1999; Esbelin et al., 2013; Cortesão et al., 2020a, b). Finally, S. capitis is a Gram-(+) bacterium commonly associated as a commensal species on human skin (Byrd et al., 2018). However, S. capitis also has the ability to cause infections in neonates and form biofilms on implants (de Silva et al., 2002; Cui et al., 2013). The Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis strain K1-2-2-23 (DSM 111179) used in this study was isolated aboard the ISS within an indoor exposure experiment (Sobisch et al., 2019). Its occurrence in crewed space stations, the clinical relevance and the phylogenetic proximity to other clinically relevant staphylococcal species make S. capitis a useful model organism to study the effects of space conditions on opportunistic human pathogens, and to identify potential risks of crew infection (Xiao et al., 2019).Radiation Levels in the Middle Stratosphere Life on Earth is protected from low-wavelength UV radiation (100–280 nm) by atmospheric ozone (Horneck et al., 2010). Above the concentration of atmospheric ozone, where large scientific balloon missions float, UV radiation levels nearly match those expected on the surface of equatorial Mars. For instance, Caro et al. (2019) recently measured an average instantaneous UVA-UVB flux of ∼6 mW cm−2 on a meteorological balloon mission flown to the middle stratosphere; the total combined dose measured was 1.9 kJ. In comparison, ∼5 mW cm–2 was the reported value to be expected at the surface of Mars for UVA-UVB according to calculations from Schuerger et al. (2003). Surprisingly few UVC measurements have been obtained for Earth’s middle stratosphere but Caro et al. (2019) modeled an expected range of 0.1–1 μW cm–2 for altitudes above the ozone layer. Besides intense UV radiation (derived levels in this study), we measured ionizing radiation in the middle stratosphere with the M-42 active dosimeter. This was the first successful M-42 flight test in preparation for the dosimetry suite onboard the upcoming Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment on the NASA Artemis I mission (Berger et al., 2019). At the ∼38 km float altitude on the MARSBOx mission, the dose rate was almost constant, around 75.5 ± 13 μGy day–1. In comparison, the dose rate measured on the surface of Mars for the same time period would approach 260 μGy day–1. A more comprehensive radiation biophysics analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo calculations) will be reported later alongside additional balloon flight measurements from a joint NASA-DLR long-duration Antarctic mission flown in December 2019. In the meantime, we point readers interested in the ionizing radiation levels of the middle stratosphere over New Mexico to the RaD-X mission results from Mertens (2016).Bacterial Survival The endurance of S. shabanensis, a non-pigmented halophile, to the (derived) UV dose of 1148 kJ m–2 during the balloon flight was unanticipated considering the original isolation source for the species was a deep-sea brine pool with no direct illumination from sunlight. Our stratosphere balloon mission results for S. shabanensis (partial resistance to UV exposure) reveal a wide variability in UV response based on the model bacterium studied. It was previously reported that even vegetative Escherichia coli cells can persist for 7 days under simulated Mars conditions, even when exposed to 8 h of UVC irradiation (200–280 nm) at a fluence of 3.6 W m–2 per day (Berry et al., 2010). Besides innate physiological differences, survival rates might also be influenced by the degree to which the UV dose was attenuated. With past laboratory- and flight-based experiments embedding microorganisms in different substrates – including Mars analog soils – the effects of UV (alone) can be difficult to assess (Rettberg et al., 2004; Wadsworth and Cockell, 2017). Cell layering (discussed later in section “A. niger spores survive Mars-like conditions”) also likely plays a role in variable survival outcomes, as reported with past stratosphere exposure studies (Khodadad et al., 2017). We expected S. capitis subsp. capitis to be more tolerant to radiation in the stratosphere because of its natural occurrence on human skin (Byrd et al., 2018), where direct illumination from sunlight would be common. For instance, the average UV dose causing erythema (abnormal redness of the skin) of Americans is approximately 25 kJ m–2 per year (Godar et al., 2001). Whether the tested bacterial strains would be able to survive in a real Mars-surface environment depends on various aspects; however, access to UV-shielding will certainly play a major role. This was seen in our study, as both the halophilic bacterium S. shabanensis, and the human skin associated bacterium S. capitis subsp. capitis survived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight. In the event that these bacteria are brought to Mars, either in robotic missions for astrobiological research purposes; or by accident through crew-led contamination in space missions (Avila-Herrera et al., 2020) our results suggest that bacterial bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time (>5 h).Bacterial Desiccation Tolerance in Mars-Like Conditions Desiccation can be a stressful condition for cells, where the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and irreversible changes in lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids can lead to death (Cox, 1993; Dose and Gill, 1995). Some microorganisms can tolerate extreme desiccation by ceasing metabolic activity in a state of anhydrobiosis (Glasheen and Hand, 1988; Wright, 1989; Potts, 1994). Our results for the bacterial species S. shabanensis showed survival under long-term desiccation and sunlight exposed flight conditions. The survival for the laboratory control and the UV-shielded organisms are similar, which may indicate a desiccation sensitivity of this strain. Cells of S. capitis subsp. capitis K1-2-2-23 were inactivated from the flight UV-exposure but did partially survive the UV-shielded layer of the Trex-Box. Interestingly, the desiccated laboratory controls for S. capitis subsp. capitis did not survive the experiment, indicating that long-term resistance to desiccation was only possible when cells were under the Mars-like atmosphere and not when kept in Earth atmosphere. The results from the balloon flight warrant further investigation to determine if a Mars gas mixture has an impact on the stability of some bacterial species. For instance, it is known that the presence of oxygen can decrease the survivability of prokaryotes during desiccation (Potts, 1994; Vriezen et al., 2007; Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017b) and in additional experiments we observed that the survival of S. capitis subsp. capitis K1-2-2-23 increased when desiccation occurred in anoxic conditions (data not shown). Finally, the last bacterial species flown in this experiment, Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, did not survive long-term desiccation. Therefore, no surviving cells could be detected in the balloon flight samples or from laboratory controls. This negative result was consistent with previous Mars analog experiments where Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9, a facultative anaerobe, survived a maximum of 3 months of desiccation (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2018, 2020). A. niger Spores Survive Mars-Like Conditions While bacterial cells were sensitive to UV exposure in the middle stratosphere, in addition to long-term desiccation, A. niger spores were highly resistant to all tested conditions. Laboratory controls demonstrated A. niger spore endurance to 5-month desiccation, when air-dried and kept at room temperature (22°C) at the bench, under Earth atmospheric conditions. Spores of A. niger shielded from UV (bottom layer) endured a 5-month desiccation within Mars-like atmosphere and pressure, with additional exposure to extreme temperature fluctuations during the balloon flight (−51°C to +21°C). Finally, spores of A. niger exposed to UV (top layer) withstood over 5 h of full simulation of Mars environmental conditions, i.e., exposed to Mars gas, atmosphere, temperature fluctuation, and to a total estimated UVA-UVB dose of 1148 kJ m–2 during the balloon flight. A previous study testing A. niger spore survival to desiccation and solar radiation was done in an experimental setting similar to this study: A. niger spore monolayers were dried in glass disks and exposed to ∼16 kJ m–2 of UVB (280–320 nm); the specimens were highly resistant, with 24% ± 5% survival (Dose et al., 2001). The extraordinarily high level of resistance of A. niger spores to UVC radiation (LD90 value of 1038 J m–2) has been previously reported by Cortesão et al. (2020a). Another balloon-flown study (i.e., same launch site and season; different year) with pigmented spores of the fungus Fuligo spectica showed that these remained viable after a 9 h exposure to conditions in the stratosphere (Díez et al., 2020). In the Aspergillus genus, secondary metabolites e.g., DHN-melanin (a pigment) and fumiquinazoline might be associated with UV protection roles (Blachowicz et al., 2020). The ubiquitous presense of A. niger spores in human indoor-closed habitats, and their high resistance to outer space conditions, suggests these will likely travel with us to Mars. A contamination scenario, several factors might affect the survivability potential of A. niger spores in a Mars-surface environment. Some are intrinsic to the spores, e.g., molecular mechanisms such as DNA repair systems; or structural protection mechanisms such as the thick cell wall (Latgé et al., 2017). Whereas other factors are external, for instance, shielding from the spacecraft surfaces or martian regolith. An important factor known to impact survival outcomes is the starting cell concentration (Khodadad et al., 2017). To test this, we compared A. niger responses to the stratosphere as either a spore monolayer (107 spores ml–1) or a spore multilayer (108 spores ml–1) (Table 4). When exposed to UV-shielded conditions, a higher starting spore concentration (multilayer) influenced all primary measures (i.e., survival fraction, spore germination, and metabolic activity). Unexpectedly, spores in a multilayer yielded a decreased survival in laboratory controls and UV shielded conditions, as well as a decreased germination rate in all tested conditions, when compared with spores in a monolayer. These discrepancies might simply be due to incomplete removal of biomass from the quartz disks or due to the presence of hyphae fusion in germination test plates; either of which could lead to undercounting. Moreover, in A. niger spores, the cell wall is a highly complex structure that plays an important role in protecting the spores from extracellular environmental stress. The spore cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides (α-glucans β-glucans), galactomannan, and chitin; and is surrounded by a rodlet layer with hydrophobic surface proteins, and a melanin layer. When germinating into vegetative cells (hyphae), the spore cell wall is remodeled and no longer provides protection to extreme conditions (Latgé et al., 2017). Considering environmental changes typically act first on the cell wall, we evaluated how Mars-like conditions might alter A. niger spore cell wall integrity. All tested spores were able to revive (i.e., germinate) and grow in media supplemented with cell wall stressors: calcofluor white or caspofungin. Calcofluor white is a non-specific fluorochrom that can bind to 1,3- and 1,4-β polysaccharides on chitin and cellulose, inhibiting chitin microfibril assembly and cell wall integrity (Fiedler et al., 2014).Conclusion To date, a variety of terrestrial analogs and simulation chambers have been used to predict outcomes for microbial exposure to Mars-like conditions. Most often, such investigations use elevated radiation and desiccation paired with low pressure and temperature alongside a Mars gas mixture (Jensen et al., 2008; Schuerger et al., 2008; Motamedi et al., 2015). However, few studies can simultaneously recreate a multi-factor Mars environment. The renewed focus on Mars robotic and human exploration e.g., Mars 2020, Mars Sample Return (NASA, 2020) and ExoMars 2022 (ESA, 2020) amplifies the need for additional Mars analog studies in the coming years. In this study we: •reported the use of a new scientific payload (MARSBOx) for stratospheric balloon missions allowing access to a wide-ranging Mars analog environment with natural ionizing and non-ionizing radiation; •demonstrated a successful experimental set-up, of the Trex-Box and MARSBOx combined, where four different microorganisms could be tested, in dried conditions, throughout a 5-month period, without cross-contaminations. •showed that the extremophilic bacterium S. shabanensis and the human skin-associated bacterium S. capitis subsp. capitis survived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight, suggesting that bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time; •revealed that highly pigmented spores from the fungus A. niger would survive, in a Mars-like middle stratosphere environment for > 5 h of UV exposure, even as a spore monolayer (106 spores mL−1), i.e., with no self-shielding. Taken together, we conclude pigmented fungal spores might be considered some of the most likely forward contaminants to survive if inadvertently delivered to Mars. Our results underscore the importance of including fungal spores in Mars forward contamination studies and relevant planetary protection policies, which currently restrict surface bioburden of ≤3 × 105 bacterial endospores for robotic lander systems that are not carrying instruments to investigate extant martian life (category IVa) (COSPAR, 2020). Moreover, fungal spore sensitivity to extreme heat or to high doses of combined sources of space radiation, as well as to other factors that affect survivability (e.g., regolith reactive compounds or regolith shielding), should be further evaluated to better assess the forward contamination potential in Mars analog environments.Data Availability Statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.Author Contributions MC, KS, SK, and KB-V performed the microbial experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
