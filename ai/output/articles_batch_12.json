Copyright notice ID: 11167097 PMID: 38862512 With precious few spaceflight missions, all space-related biological and biomedical-health data are priceless national resources that anyone should be able to easily access. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) plays a crucial role in ensuring such accessibility, housing comprehensive space-related datasets derived not only from various model organisms but also from non-NASA human astronauts1. These datasets cover a wide spectrum of biological assays conducted at multiple levels, ranging across cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. They effectively capture diverse types of data, including ‘omics, phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral changes experienced in space2,3. Additionally, OSDR enriches this data by providing metadata contextualizing each experiment including the associated experimental hardware and environmental telemetry. OSDR has worked with a large and open scientific community to standardize data generation and formatting, enabling advanced analytics, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis. With the support of NASA’s scientific leadership, the spirit of Open Science has permeated every scientific division at NASA, including the Biological and Physical Science (BPS) Division. The BPS Division has emerged as a pivotal force in fueling humanity’s fascination with space exploration by understanding the mechanisms of life adapting to extreme environmental hazards of deep space4. As NASA launched the ambitious \"Transform to Open Science\" program (TOPS)5 in 2023, it aims to accelerate the adoption of a more reproducible and transparent approach to research. TOPS also aims to train 20,000 scientists in the art of Open Science by 2028 (https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), pushing for better equity and inclusivity in science. Within the BPS Division, the curation of an extensive array of space biological, space health, and mission telemetry data in standardized formats has been vetted by over 500 citizen scientists, members of the NASA OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWG - https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/join.html). As a result, OSDR system ensures the invaluable data’s findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR)6, despite the challenges posed by its multi-hierarchical, multimodal, and heterogeneous nature. As a celebration of 2023 being the year of Open Science at NASA, a Nature portfolio Collection titled \"The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits7,’’ is a series of inspiring articles enabled by OSDR, enriched by new data generously shared by civilian astronauts aboard the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. The investigator team involved in this work has embraced Open Science by sharing research data and enabling data mining by the AWG community. Data presented in this Nature portfolio Collection were fully utilized because of the open and accessible nature of the OSDR system. This array of work shows how NASA handled the storage and reuse of a diverse range of data from molecular to ecosystem levels, encompassing tabular, omics, imaging, code, video, biospecimens, and environmental physical-chemical telemetry data. The AWGs played a critical role standardizing metadata and data processing pipelines in OSDR, enabling groundbreaking discoveries in space biology and biomedical health by making meta-analysis possible. In this context, two recent articles involving the AWGs were published in Nature Machine Intelligence and featured in a special issue on AI, detailing the future role of AI and Open Science in deep space biological research8 and biomedical health support9, describing how Open Science and standardization integrated with AI can maximize the value of limited yet vital spaceflight data. The spirit of Open Science and the invaluable insights from space biology have transcended boundaries, extending their embrace to other vital groups within NASA, including the Human Research Program (HRP) focused on the health and performance of NASA Astronauts. This Open Science approach champions practical, collaborative scientific discovery, with an emphasis on data sharing and immediate applications. Insights from space biology, facilitated by Open Science, are vital not just for aspirational goals like moon and Mars missions, but for direct advancements in human health and technology on earth. This Nature portfolio Collection highlights how collective efforts and open data can drive substantial scientific progress, merging the thrill of cosmic exploration with tangible and immediate benefits.

    "introduction": "Introduction The increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceflight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)1–3 provides open and FAIR4 access to spaceflight and space-relevant biological studies from the past decades. Research enabled by OSDR data has revealed a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants to mammals (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html). Most prior research using OSDR data has focused on model organisms such as rodents, worms, and fruit flies. These valuable measurements provide insight into the response of neuromuscular, immune, and developmental biosystems to the stressors and hazards of spaceflight. Integrating human in vivo data takes these studies one step further and map previously characterized model organisms’ biological responses to the limited knowledge on human physiology in space. The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In the current special Nature package titled “The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,” a wide battery of analyses of these data have already provided valuable insights (Mason et al., Nature. 2023). The I4 mission stands as a significant milestone, amassing an extensive collection of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, thereby adding an invaluable series of datasets for deciphering the repercussions of spaceflight on human health. The open access of these datasets in the NASA OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, citizen scientists, researchers, and students to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. In this short article, we guide the readers on how to best conduct future analysis by presenting a series of vignettes illustrating pathways for accessing metadata and data from this rich resource through OSDR. We hope these guidelines will help the community contribute further to the vast compendium of findings already published from OSDR data and enable new hypotheses to be tested with both the human and model organism data. Compared to traditional model organisms used for research, one unique aspect of these data is the breadth of longitudinal measurements available from several human astronauts. Such temporal information for several individuals is unprecedented and pushes further the well-known “NASA’s Twin Study”5 where a single astronaut was monitored over 340 days on the international space station, referred to as a “N of 1” experiment. In contrast, even though the duration of the I4 mission was much shorter (3 days), it was at a higher altitude (590 km vs. 420 km), and since it featured four individuals monitored with such biological depth, the data opens the door to new and innovative follow-up studies (e.g. Polaris Dawn missions). Incorporating environmental data with microbiome data and a wide variety of phenotypic and high-throughput sequencing assays provides a rare opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessment of short-term and long-term spaceflight effects on humans. These datasets also provide a much-needed ability to compare human spaceflight effects to the previously characterized spaceflight consequences in model organisms. The analyses conducted thus far on the I4 mission’s data have already yielded substantial revelations, shedding light on the intricate interplay between space stressors and the immune system, cell-specific responses to spaceflight, rapid microbial interchange of the crew, and detailed maps of the changes in the skin from astronauts (Overbey et al., Nature 2023; Tierney et al., Nature Microbiology 2023; Kim et al., Nature 2023). These analyses demonstrate the great potential of these data for future knowledge. The inclusion of multi-modal data, such as the blood datasets, which cover a diverse array of measurements (OSD-569, −570, −571, −575), also presents an exciting avenue for future exploration. This broader scope for analysis could unveil deeper connections between different biological responses and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the body’s adaptations to the space environment. Combining omics and medical assay data is the first step to understanding the biological significance of integrated findings. Translating them into actionable insights for space health will be our next step, which remains challenging but, for the first time, attainable. Looking ahead, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in the analysis of biomedical data from the I4 mission also holds great promise. With all OSDR data accessible in a cloud-based public repository, standardized metadata, and a robust API query system, this effort demonstrates AI readiness and empowers our user community to explore beyond current findings. The sheer volume and complexity of the data call for advanced computational approaches that can uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden. Powerful techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, hold the potential to extract meaningful but complex insights from the vast dataset, facilitating the identification of subtle trends and potential health risks associated with space travel. NASA OSDR’s commitment to FAIR practices ensures that researchers across the globe can harness the power of AI to conduct cutting-edge analyses, fostering collaboration and accelerating the pace of discovery. Finally, this work sets a precedent for space agencies to establish comprehensive, post-mission health monitoring programs, incorporating omics and medical assay data, while informing future mission planning and health risk mitigation strategies.",

Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data records For illustration purposes, a single dataset will be used as an example for researcher access of I4 data from OSDR: OSD-572, which holds metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from crew skin samples collected to assess the response of microbial populations (skin, oral, nasal) to spaceflight. Samples were collected at three timepoints pre-flight (launch minus 92 days (L-92), L-44, and L-3), mid-flight for three time points (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and post-flight (return plus 1 day (R + 1), R + 45 R + 82). The OSDR study page (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-572) contains several sections with information about the study, including a description of the experiment that gave rise to the data, associated experiments, payloads, and missions, and a section detailing each experimental or analytical protocol involved in generating the dataset. A “publications” section also lists all published papers associated with this study. Figure 2 shows snapshots of the repository, emphasizing the metadata tables available for OSD-572. The Samples table (Fig. 2a) contains metadata information on each sample, including intrinsic characteristics of the sample (e.g., host organism, material type) as well as factor values relating to the experiment (e.g., spaceflight status, time collected). The Assays table contains metadata information for each sample pertaining to the assay specified in the drop-down menu (Fig. 2b). Users can choose a specific assay to display from the drop-down menu, and the assay table will update accordingly. Fig. 2. Sample and assay metadata available in OSDR for I4 study OSD-572. Open in a new tab a Sample metadata table contains sample level information regarding sample characteristics and experimental factors. b Assay metadata table contains information about each assay on a per sample level.Both metadata tables can be downloaded as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file with user-selected columns to aid downstream analyses. Sample names map across metadata and data fields to enable targeted selection of specific samples or differential analysis across groups. Figure 3 shows the raw and processed data files available to browse and download through the OSDR study page for OSD-630. All OSDR datasets use the ISA-Tab (Investigation, Study, Assay) metadata model6 to capture experimental metadata for each study. Under the “Study Metadata Files” folder, users can download the *ISA.zip file for the study, which contains the ISA-Tab files that hold all study information displayed on OSDR, to enable further characterization of the dataset (Fig. 3a). Investigator-submitted data, both raw and processed, can be found under “Metagenomics Data Files”. This folder houses raw FASTQ sequences, which are essentially the sequence files post-removal of human-read data (see Fig. 3b for visual representation). Fig. 3. Data available for browse and download in OSDR for I4 study OSD-630.

These pipelines are instrumental in generating and disseminating processed data outputs for all omics datasets. They incorporate a rigorous quality control assessment process, including tools such as FastQC and MultiQC, particularly tailored for sequencing data analysis (refer to Fig. 3c, d for an illustrative depiction). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the OSDR encompasses a diverse array of physiological and phenotypic data types, spanning cytokine panels, complete blood counts, imaging data, ultrasonography records, and more. These data types are subject to stringent data and metadata standards, complemented by tabular data transformation protocols. This meticulous approach is designed to uphold data quality and foster data reuse. Importantly, these physio-phenotypic standards have been developed and reviewed in collaboration with subject matter experts who specialize in the respective assays, forming an integral part of the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWG).Usage notes These data, like any other datasets deposited into the OSDR repository, can be programmatically accessed through GLOpenAPI (https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/GLOpenAPI/). Here, we provide a quick example of running a differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment visualization in R (https://www.R-project.org/) using the unnormalized counts data associated with study OSD-569 (whole blood direct RNA-seq data). However, please note that unlike most other datasets, access to human RNA-Seq data requires authentication with sufficient credentials, which may be made available upon request. I.e. while normally one would simply use the read.csv() function, for these data, we will define a get.csv() function that passes the authentication token in the header of the request; we assume the token is stored in a variable called “TOKEN”: library(httr)get.csv = function (url, …) {auth = paste(\"Bearer\", TOKEN) response = GET(url, add_headers(Authorization=auth)) return(read.csv(text=content(response), …))} Metadata Since dataset OSD-569 is of interest, a query component “id=OSD-569” should be passed, and to retrieve all factor value metadata, a component “study.factor value” is added. Sample names and factors are columns in the metadata table. The header of the metadata table consists of two lines, and the first one may be skipped in many cases (see the GLOpenAPI manual for full explanation). The sample name is always the 3rd column (after “accession” and “assay name”), but, for illustrative purposes, here, we read everything as regular columns and assign row names manually in a later step. The request is sent to the GLOpenAPI “metadata” endpoint: GLOPENAPI = \"https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/GLOpenAPI/\"query = URLencode(\"id=OSD-569&study.factor value\")url = paste0(API, \"metadata/?\", query)metadata = get.csv(url, skip=1)cat(\"Metadata column names:\\n\")print(colnames(metadata)) Output: Metadata column names: [1] \"X.accession\" \"assay.name\" [3] \"sample.name\" \"subject\" [5] \"timestamp\"Data The same query component is included to retrieve data for OSD-569 (“id=OSD-569”). For differential expression analyses, data from files containing unnormalized RNA-Seq counts is requested (component “file.datatype=unnormalized counts”); the request is sent to the GLOpenAPI “data” endpoint. As it is common for differential expression analyses, sample names are column names in the data table, and gene names are row names. Gene names always come first, so we pass “row.names=1” to the get.csv() function. The header of the data table consists of three lines (accession, assay name, sample name), but as we are working with a single assay, we can skip the first two lines: q = \"id=OSD-569&file.datatype=unnormalized counts\"url = paste0(GLOPENAPI, \"data/?\", URLencode(q))data = get.csv( url, check.names=F, skip=2, row.names=1)Differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis At this point, the data is ready to be ingested into standard analysis tools, for example, DESeq27and fgsea8 with the use of MSigDb9 pathways. For DESeq2, sample names in the metadata should be represented as row names; and if, for example, we want to classify all timestamps into “preflight” (anything before launch, i.e. timestamps starting with “L-“), “postflight” (immediately after landing, “R+1”) and “recovery” (all other timestamps starting with “R+“), we also add a “status” column: rownames(metadata) = metadata$sample.namemetadata$status = sapply(metadata$timestamp, function (t) { ifelse(t==\"R+1\", \"postflight\", ifelse(startsWith(t, \"R+\"), \"recovery\", \"preflight\"))}) Finally, we run the analyses and visualize enrichment of a particular MSigDb pathway (DIAZ_CHRONIC_MYELOGENOUS_LEUKEMIA_UP) with result displayed in Fig. 4: Fig. 4.

Further, the integration of medical assays with multi-omics data, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other data modalities, facilitates meta-analyses geared towards better understanding of the human response to the space environment. The correlation between omics data and clinically significant endpoints derived from medical data holds paramount significance in elucidating health implications. Nonetheless, the integration of disparate data types remains a persistent challenge in the biomedical research domain, exacerbated by inconsistencies across laboratories and studies, as well as inherent variability in individual responses. Moreover, space missions like I4, which encompass multiple data collection points (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight, etc.), provide longitudinal datasets that enable the intricate yet potent exploration of space-induced responses over time. Over the five years, the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) were convened in order to ensure the reusability and standardization of data available within OSDR. These AWGs consist of diverse OSDR data stakeholders, including investigators, commercial entities, academic researchers, and students. Each AWG is dedicated to a distinct data category or domain of expertise, including animals, artificial intelligence, microbes, multi-omics, phenotypic data, and plants. Professionals within these AWGs contributed their expertise towards the formulation of standardized data processing pipelines and the development of assay metadata configurations tailored to each new data type. Consequently, OSDR was well-equipped to receive, curate, standardize, and process the wide spectrum of medical and omics data collected during the I4 mission. Medical data serves as a crucial resource for gaining insights into biological responses. However, balancing the imperative to protect sensitive health information of astronauts while enabling data sharing for research necessitates the robust implementation of privacy and security protocols. OSDR has introduced an innovative capability, allowing users to access metadata associated with private medical datasets, albeit without direct access to the data itself. OSDR’s dedication to comprehensive and unambiguous metadata, coupled with the utilization of the GLOpenAPI, underscores its readiness for analysis and artificial intelligence applications. The data query method illustrated here marks an initial step toward realizing the goal of Precision Space Health10,11. In cases where users seek to employ private medical datasets such as those collected on I4 for research purposes, an application process is in place that mandates approval from an institutional review board (IRB).Supplementary information Reporting Summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements OSDR is funded by the NASA Space Biology Program, part of the NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division within the NASA Science Mission Directorate; non-omics data are also partially supported by the NASA Human Research Program (HRP).

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples. Subject terms: Databases, Molecular biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction NASA GeneLab platform, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) constitutes an omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) interactive open-access database where users are able to upload, download, share, store and analyze data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. Approximately half of the datasets in the GeneLab repository consist of transcription profiling assays. The most prevalent transcription study assay type is microarray with RNA sequencing data being the fastest-growing assay in the database. Other assay types include genome sequencing, protein expression, metabolite profiling, epigenomics, metagenomics, and epitranscriptomics1,2. There are still many unknown mechanisms regarding the biological effects taking place during spaceflight. Discovering these mechanisms is essential for NASA’s goal to keep its astronauts healthy, especially with the planned human deep space exploration missions, which are near the horizon. From the very first space missions, it became evident that microgravity causes physiological changes to mammals, including significant abnormalities presented in the cardiovascular, immune, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems3,4. There are multiple and intricate hazards to human health and performance in spaceflight caused by a combination of environmental stressors such as gravitational alterations, ionizing radiation, high level of carbon dioxide, changes in diet and physiological stress. Appropriate countermeasures must be developed in order to effectively minimize the aforementioned impairments3,5–7. Due to the small size of the astronaut cohort and privacy concerns surrounding human data collection and sharing, most spaceflight data originate from model organisms rather than Homo sapiens. An example of a model organism is Mus musculus, a suitable model for studying the effects of altered gravitational conditions. Current knowledge of the effects of spaceflight is derived from experimental models in vivo, ex vivo (e.g., tissue) and in vitro (e.g., cell culture)8. Opportunities for actual microgravity experiments are rare and challenging to access due to the infrequency of spaceflights and the various associated restrictions, including expenses, equipment requirements, and the need for volunteers. Thus, space analogs, such as random positioning machines, clinostats, head-down bedrest, hindlimb unloading rodent model, and rotating wall vessel, have been developed aiming to simulate altered gravity conditions9–11. In this study, we review the effects of microgravity and other spaceflight environmental factors on Homo sapiens and Mus musculus based on microarray studies and experiments housed in the NASA GeneLab repository1,2. We primarily focus on experiments that have been conducted in either actual or simulated microgravity in order to determine the affected functionalities at the gene, cellular or organ levels.",
    "methods": "Methods Data and literature mining We identified all the microarray studies and datasets housed in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) by applying the following search filters: “Assay Type: Microarray”, “Tissue: All”, “Factor: All”, “Organisms: Mus musculus OR Human (Homo sapiens)”. The search was limited to studies published up to January 2023 to ensure the inclusion of the most recent research. We obtained the following datasets: OSD-4, OSD-18, OSD-21, OSD-29, OSD-30, OSD-32, OSD-33, OSD-50, OSD-61, OSD-79, OSD-80, OSD-87, OSD-88, OSD-89, OSD-93, OSD-94, OSD-107, OSD-109, OSD-111, OSD-116, OSD-117, OSD-131, OSD-135, OSD-148, OSD-153, OSD-156, OSD-158, OSD-159, OSD, 160, OSD-183, OSD-202, OSD-222, OSD-232, OSD-227, OSD-228, OSD-324, OSD-342, OSD-396, OSD-432, OSD-455, from Mus musculus and OSD-5, OSD-9, OSD-13, OSD-51, OSD-52, OSD-54, OSD-55, OSD-56, OSD-71, OSD-73, OSD-78, OSD-92, OSD-114, OSD-115, OSD-118, OSD-124, OSD-125, OSD-128, OSD-129, OSD-130, OSD-140, OSD-149, OSD-152, OSD-151, OSD-154, OSD-155, OSD-157, OSD-172, OSD-174, OSD-175, OSD-176, OSD-178, OSD-182, OSD-188, OSD-189, OSD-195, OSD-198, OSD-283, OSD-285, OSD-297, OSD-317, OSD-354, OSD-367, OSD-368, OSD-369, OSD-370, OSD-410, OSD-484, OSD-542, OSD-544, OSD-545, OSD-546 from Homo sapiens. Furthermore, the GeneLab repository federates search with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of  (). The GeneLab repository encompasses the entirety of the relevant datasets present in the GEO database. A more comprehensive search had to be done though using the following query: ”(microgravity OR spaceflight OR gravity) AND “Homo sapiens”) and ”(microgravity OR spaceflight OR gravity) AND “Mus musculus”) and applying the following filter criteria: “Study type: Expression profiling by array”. Academic research databases, such as PubMed, and ScienceDirect were also used with the keywords “microgravity and microarray”, “spaceflight and microarray”, “gravity and microarray” and “weightlessness and microarray”. Because GeneLab ingests datasets from GEO and provides an option to search through the GEO database, no new datasets were found in this search, but research articles found in this search were used to inform the discussion section in this manuscript. We describe the differences and similarities between the findings of the original studies for each tissue type in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. Differential gene expression comparative meta-analysis on the musculoskeletal system We also performed a comparative meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes from transcriptomics datasets between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, specifically concentrated on the musculoskeletal system (Fig. 9). This choice was driven by the fact that the musculoskeletal system encompasses a wide range of tissue types that are highly comparable between human and mouse datasets. By focusing on this physiological system, we aimed to evaluate the consistency of findings and identify commonly upregulated and downregulated genes within each species, as well as between the two species. Fig. 9. An overview of the effects of altered gravity environment on various physiological aspects in both mouse and human systems incudes musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system alterations. Open in a new tab Comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species.To demonstrate the concordance on a gene-by-gene level between experiments we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient between gene counts in different datasets from the same tissue type. To avoid duplicate genes per experiment we calculated the average expression value for each common gene and removed null values. To identify differentially expressed genes that are reproducible between experiments, we focused on experiments which fulfill these inclusion criteria: (1) case–control study, (2) derived from musculoskeletal tissue of the same species, (3) untreated samples, (4) microgravity vs control group comparison. We identified in each study genes which were differentially expressed between microgravity-exposed samples and control samples with an adjusted P value (Benjamini–Hochberg method) threshold of below 0.05 and |log2FC| threshold above 1, which reflects a substantial change in gene expression. The data preprocessing and differential expression analysis procedures were conducted using the R programming language. Normalization was performed using the affy or oligo packages in the R Bioconductor environment65–67. Specifically, for the Affymetrix datasets, we employed the Robust Multiarray Analysis (RMA) algorithm through the R/Bioconductor packages affy and oligo which performs background correction, log2 transformation, quantile normalization, and the summarization of all probe sets into a single expression value for each gene. For the Agilent datasets, we performed normalization using the R/Bioconductor package limma. Following this preprocessing pipeline, each normalized dataset underwent quality control checks, incorporating an outlier removal approach. Quality control procedures were executed using the R/Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics, which involved generating boxplots of logarithm ratios, PCA and MA plots. Any samples identified as outliers in both MA and PCA plots during the quality control assessment were excluded from their respective datasets.",
    "results": "Results Review of effects of altered gravitational conditions on Mus musculus It has been shown that the central nervous system (CNS) of Mus musculus exhibits severe abnormalities after exposure to spaceflight. For example, neuroinflammation has been identified following ionizing radiation individually or combined with microgravity exposure12,13. Santucci et al. (OSD-33, 10.26030/7btg-6q49) studied the effects on gene and protein expression level in mouse brain tissue following a 3-month mission on the International Space Station (ISS). They found that the expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) was decreased in hippocampus, cortex and adrenal gland during spaceflight conditions, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) did not show consistent changes across the brain regions and the adrenal gland. Both proteins are involved in learning and memory via regulating neural plasticity. Genes related to various metabolic and catabolic processes were downregulated as well, while proteins related to mitochondrial and calcium metabolism, synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, and amino acid transportation were upregulated14. Frigeri et al. (OSD-32, 10.26030/jpyz-fn46) performed mRNA expression analysis in brain tissue of mice that were hindlimb-unloaded for 2 weeks. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a microgravity analog in which a rodent’s hind limbs are suspended and in disuse. Genes related to the transport of small molecules and ions into cells were upregulated in the HU group. An increased risk of venous thrombosis, as well as changes in functional pathways such as immune response, learning and memory performance, and cell junction were also noted15. Holley et al. (OSD-536, 10.26030/bg5q-t229) highlighted significant alterations in gene expression profiles associated with neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function in brain tissue of mice that were housed on the ISS for thirty-five days. In particular, genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated16. The detrimental consequences of microgravity exposure on the musculoskeletal system have also been extensively documented. Fitzgerald et al. (OSD-232, 10.26030/9626-w275) studied articular and sternal cartilage from mice that had experienced spaceflight conditions for 30 days. Genes that encode structural extracellular matrix components, such as Fmod, Ogn, Omd, Dcn, Dpt, Prelp, Col10a1, Tsp4, and Comp were downregulated in articular cartilage. Proteoglycan levels were lowered in the spaceflight articular cartilage, while there was no proteoglycan loss in the sternal cartilage. The authors concluded that this is because in microgravity, articular cartilage experiences near-complete biomechanical unloading, but sternal cartilage still experiences biomechanical loading17. Gambara et al. (OSD-135, 10.26030/rjyq-x751) found that in longissimus dorsi from mice flown for 30 days on the BION-M1 biosatellite, genes linked to insulin sensitivity and metabolism of skeletal muscle were significantly dysregulated, while myofiber cross-sectional area and myosin heavy chain subtype patterns were not altered18. Chakraborty et al. (OSD-396, 10.26030/ce4f-xx71) examined the procedure of bone fracture healing (using a segmental bone defect model) in mice housed on the ISS for 4 weeks. Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of callus tissue after spaceflight indicated increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity, while an apoptosis and cellular morbidity gene-network signal was activated in the spaceflight callus tissue compared to controls19. Gambara et al. (OSD-111, 10.26030/9580-9n52) assessed changes in gene expression in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus following 30 days on the BION-M1 capsule. They identified differentially expressed genes related to key biological processes such as contractile machinery, calcium homeostasis, muscle development, cell metabolism, and inflammatory and oxidative stress response8. Based on data from the same mice, Blottner et al. studied the Homer gene, which is thought to be downregulated during muscle atrophy. They found the short Homer1a isoform was upregulated, while the long Homer2 isoform was downregulated in the soleus muscle after microgravity exposure. This isoform sensitivity appears to be regulated by muscle activity or inactivity at the neuromuscular junction20. Däpp et al. (OSD-228, 10.26030/bfmx-z866) examined transcriptome alterations in soleus tissue of mice that underwent hindlimb suspension (HLS). HLS is a microgravity analog in which a rodent’s hind limbs are suspended, resulting in disuse similar to microgravity exposure. They found increased myogenic factors, contractile genes, and metabolic genes during reloading, as well as indications that sarcomere regulation is sensitive to mechanic loading21. Flück et al. recommended that especially in tissue plasticity studies, we should normalize gene expression levels using tissue-relevant references (e.g., muscle weight, volume, nuclear content)21,22. Mazzati et al. (OSD-227, 10.26030/vk0m-0558) also used HLS to detect differential expression of genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism in soleus and gastrocnemius tissue23. Allen et al. (OSD-21, 10.25966/c36b-3g68) stated that spaceflight significantly alters expression of gastrocnemius tissue genes that are associated with muscle growth (e.g., phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85a, MAFbx/atrogin1, insulin response substrate-1, and forkhead box O1 transcription factor) and muscle fiber type24. Furthermore, weightlessness causes a decrease in bone formation by osteoblasts and an increase in osteolytic functions of osteoclasts. Pardo et al. examined gene expression profiles of 2T3 preosteoblast cells to find genes particularly sensitive to gravity changes, and found that simulated microgravity downregulated alkaline phosphatase, run-related transcription factor 2, osteomodulin and parathyroid hormone receptor 1, while cathepsin K was upregulated25. Patel et al. (OSD-30, 10.25966/90vx-bf79) compared preosteoblast exposure to two different simulators of altered gravity: Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Machine. They found similar results from each method, including altered expression of the same 14 skeletal remodeling genes. In particular, they found inhibited alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity in both, demonstrating that both methods inhibit preosteoblast differentiation, consistent with microgravity-induced bone mass decrease. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PthR1) involved in calcium mobilization and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) associated with skeleton development (e.g., cartilage formation) were downregulated in the Rotating Wall Vessel conditions26. The role of parathyroid hormone-related protein was also studied by Camirand et al. (OSD-107, 10.26030/2x2z-6w28) using trabecular and calvarial cells. They confirmed that PthR protein has anti-apoptotic function under microgravity, and as a result it could be defined as an anabolic agent to prevent cell death in trabecular osteoblasts27. Uda et al. (OSD-324, 10.26030/s7kj-h383) studied altered gravity effects on osteocytic cell line Ocy454 for 2, 4 and 6 days onboard the ISS, concluding that glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption were increased during spaceflight28. Wang et al. (OSD-547, 10.26030/y2af-c498) examined gene expression profiles of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 under simulated altered gravitational conditions via large gradient high magnetic field, showing that this environment affected the expression of genes related to enzyme, peptide, G-protein coupled receptors and glucose metabolic process29. Sambandam et al. (OSD-18, 10.25966/j6hy-d340) investigated the differentiation procedure of osteoclasts using a rotary cell culture system to simulate microgravity. In particular, they highlighted increased expression of genes associated with enhanced osteoclast differentiation and function, such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signaling proteins30. Osteoblast precursors such as Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) are sensitive to mechanical loading. Monticone et al. (OSD-29, 10.25966/6rr8-r017) studied murine BMSC cultures that were onboard the ISS for 8 days, while half of them were stimulated with osteo-inductive medium. They found that cell proliferation was inhibited in spaceflight conditions and that differentially expressed genes were related to neural development, neuron morphogenesis, transmission of nerve impulse and synapse31. Ortega et al. (OSD-50, 10.26030/69kd-nx87) differentiated murine bone marrow cells (mBMC) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF) for 14 days during spaceflight, detecting significant increase in cell proliferation and differential expression of genes related to the coagulation pathway. They found that the macrophages that differentiate during spaceflight express slightly different markers, and that the post-spaceflight population may be slightly more differentiated32. In addition, Chapes and Ortega (OSD-50, 10.26030/69kd-nx87) highlighted the importance of ground-based experiments before spaceflight in order to assess macrophage differentiation33. Astronauts suffer from skin dryness, itching, coarsening of epidermis and decreased skin elasticity. Neutelings et al. (OSD-61, 10.26030/2zjp-sj35) reported a fifteen percent reduction of dermal thickness of cutaneous tissue collected from mice exposed to spaceflight conditions for 90 days. They also reported deregulated hair follicle cycle and upregulated myogenesis34,35. Mao et al. (OSD-116, 10.26030/ya5a-e896) confirmed the increased risk for pathophysiology damage and carcinogenesis in skin tissue during a 13-day spaceflight mission as they observed upregulation in cellular antioxidants, ROS production and tissue remodeling36. Weightlessness induces severe effects on the immune system as well. Lebsack et al. (OSD-4, 10.25966/qq9p-pc28) reported alterations in the expression of genes regulating stress, T-cell signaling activity and glucocorticoid receptors following the exposure of mice to spaceflight for 13 days. In particular, Rbm3, Ctla-4, IFN-a2a genes were upregulated and Hsph110, Hsp90aa1, Cxcl10, Strip1, Fkbp4m, and CD44 genes were downregulated in the thymus tissue of spaceflown mice37. Beheshti et al.38 utilized the NASA GeneLab database to analyze transcriptomic data from different rodent datasets (e.g., OSD-4, 10.25966/qq9p-pc28, OSD-21, 10.25966/c36b-3g68, OSD-25, 10.25966/kzxa-s692, OSD-48, 10.26030/jq04-0n51, OSD-61, 10.26030/2zjp-sj35, OSD-63, 10.26030/gsmt-8e70, OSD-111, 10.26030/9580-9n52), revealing critical genes, signaling pathways and circulating micro-RNA signatures as key biomarkers for astronauts’ health. Particularly, they identified TP53 and transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-β1) as the most prevalent regulators across all tissues, and TGF-β1 was the most connected gene across all tissues, suggesting it is a key driver gene for spaceflight response34. Review of effects of altered gravitational conditions on Homo sapiens Experiments of human muscle tissue exposed to microgravity validated the aforementioned findings concerning the musculoskeletal system’s vulnerability to altered gravity. Chopard et al. (OSD-51, 10.26030/3w73-jn41) examined gene expression profiles of soleus and vastus lateralis muscles during long-term (60 days) bedrest conditions, as well as evaluating potential countermeasures such as protein supplementation and combined resistance-aerobic exercise. They reported an induction of metallothioneins, genes involved in antioxidant stress response, in the non-countermeasures groups. They also reported limited counteracting effects of the nutritional countermeasure, while aerobic training significantly counteracted the negative effects on muscle metabolism39. Rullman et al. (OSD-198, 10.26030/kcrr-p336) added the hypoxia variable into the equation, studying effects on micro-RNA (miRNA) expression of horizontal bedrest with normal level of oxygen, bedrest in hypoxia, and ambulation in hypoxia. Few miRNAs were modestly differentially regulated, such as let-7, miR-15, miR-25, miR-199, and miR-133, thus only minor alterations could be detected. The Planetary Habitat Simulation study aimed to clarify biological effects of prolonged (21-day) musculoskeletal unloading combined with hypoxia. Rullman et al. (OSD-195, 10.26030/r6bv-rk07) identified upregulation of genes associated with denervation (e.g., acetylcholine receptor subunit delta and perinatal myosin) and a robust inhibition of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family40,41. Alibegovic et al. (OSD-370, 10.26030/zyy0-6497) investigated muscle biopsies taken from healthy young men before and after bedrest, in basal or insulin-stimulated states collected from vastus lateralis as well. They confirmed downregulation of mitochondrial function pathways and increased muscle insulin resistance induced by bedrest conditions, which were only partially recovered after muscle retraining42. In addition, several studies have aimed to determine how human bone marrow stem cells react and differentiate in altered gravitational conditions. Mayer-Wagner et al. (OSD-124, 10.26030/6fwd-2p79) studied how chondrogenesis is affected during simulated reduced gravity and low-frequency electromagnetic fields, concluding that microgravity conditions significantly downregulated COLXA1, COL2A1, and aggrecan, representing decreased chondrogenic potential43. Bradamante et al. (OSD-546, 10.26030/mg6a-qv31) examined the effects in terms of growth and differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) housed on the ISS for 2 weeks. They identified upregulation of genes that are related to osteogenesis (BGLAP, CHRDL1, and SPP1) and metabolism of steroid hormones and vitamins A, D pathway (CYP19A1, CYP24A1, AKR1B1, HSD11B1). Cell proliferation, motility and cell-cell communication seemed also to be affected as evidenced by downregulation of CSNK2A2, ITGAV, NRCAM, and NRP2, while the RAB27b gene associated with microvesicle formation was significantly upregulated. Moreover, they reported stemness loss, no evidence of apoptosis or senescene, notable upregulation of collagen genes, and notable downregulation of matrix metallopeptidases44. Terada et al. (OSD-174, 10.26030/6sg0-ng36) analyzed data from a JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) experiment conducted on a 6-month mission on the ISS, where both hair follicles and shafts were collected from ten astronauts. They reported altered expression of genes associated with cell cycle disruption in hair follicles (e.g., COMP and CDK1) and hair growth (e.g., ANGPTL7 and FGF18)45. Zhang et al. (OSD-118, 10.26030/rcyt-qp10) investigated miRNA expression in non-proliferating human fibroblast cells in response to spaceflight environment (ISS). Minor effects were observed on gene or miRNA expression on day 14, whilst most of the differentially expressed genes were related to cell growth on day 3 (see ref. 46). Lu et al. (OSD-114, 10.26030/yssj-bg68) studied human fibroblasts housed on ISS with and without treatment of bleomycin (a compound which induces DNA damage), to better understand the effects of microgravity on cellular DNA damage response. Although several genes were altered between treatment and control groups in flight and on Earth, including some of the same genes, there was no significant change when comparing flight treatment to Earth treatment. The authors also concluded that cell type and cell growth condition influence whether microgravity affects DNA damage response47. Spaceflight causes profound effects on lymphocyte functions that are well documented. Ward et al. (OSD-5, 10.25966/qq4z-4m04) detected ten downregulated genes (e.g., GNLY, PSME2, PrX4, HLA-DRA, LY75, IL18, and DOCK2) related to immune response in activated T lymphocytes that were exposed to simulated microgravity (Rotating Wall Vessel) for 24 h48. Chang et al. (OSD-13, 10.26030/4an8-r968) studied T cells housed on the ISS and stimulated with the T-cell mitogen ConA and anti-CD28. They found impaired T-cell activation as well as profound downregulation of Rel/NF-κB, CREB, SRF and immediate early genes’ expression, indicating very early effects of microgravity on T-cell gene expression49. Boonyaratanakornkit et al. (OSD-484, 10.26030/semj-9y19) revealed that Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key regulator factor regarding NF-κB, AP-1, CREB and T-cell activation in simulated microgravity50. Thiel et al. (OSD-189, 10.26030/r0md-de60, OSD-172, 10.26030/jx41-b816, OSD-188, 10.26030/3jq1-s218) identified ATP6V1A/D, IGHD3-3/IGHDE-10, and LINC00837 as genes that are significantly affected by gravity, as they investigated non-activated human Jurkat T cells in both microgravity and hypergravity conditions. They also found that chromosomal region 11p15.4 seems to be particularly robust to altered gravity51,52. Vogel et al. and Tauber et al. focused on the effects of altered gravity on immune signaling, as captured by the OSD-283 (10.26030/ge2v-wr94) and OSD-297 (10.26030/bb5k-1h18) datasets. In particular, Vogel et al. identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) as a potential pharmacological target for counteracting deterioration of immune system, and PDK1 as sensitive in Jurkat T and U937 myelomonocytic cells exposed to altered gravitational conditions. In addition, Tauber et al. described well-regulated homeostasis and transcriptional stability of oxidative stress-related pathways53,54. U937 myelomonocytic cells were also studied by Thiel et al. (OSD-283, 10.26030/ge2v-wr94, OSD-297, 10.26030/bb5k-1h18), who detected significant gene expression alterations after only 20 s of altered gravitational conditions (both microgravity and hypergravity). However, all initially differentially expressed transcripts adjusted rapidly afterward, verifying the existence of immediate adaptation mechanisms55. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs seem to regulate effects, associated with apoptosis and immune response, in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells under simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation according to Fu et al. (OSD-545, 10.26030/7ta4-ga35)56. Chakraborty et al. (OSD-54, 10.26030/8mfb-wa73) customized a cell culture module for human dermal microvascular endothelial cell growth in order to examine the impact of spaceflight environment on endothelial cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. They found that long-term lipopolysaccharide exposure resulted in a delayed host response, inefficient in pathogens’ potential invasion57. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells’ exposure to microgravity showed significant altered transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation, stress response, cell cycle and apoptosis. Findings from Versari et al. (OSD-52, 10.26030/nt3p-p547) suggested that microgravity affects inflammatory response and endothelial behavior, while promoting senescence58. Girardi et al. (OSD-55, 10.26030/9thk-dv75, OSD-56, 10.26030/nc96-xp67, OSD-128, 10.26030/73sd-9a85, OSD-129, 10.26030/sec3-y188) examined mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) exposed to simulated microgravity through a miRNA-mRNA integration analysis, detecting effects on inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation decrease59. Let-7i, miR-7, miR-7-1, miR-27a, miR-144, miR-200a, miR-598, and miR-650 were found to be deregulated in human PBLs exposed to radiation and simulated microgravity (Rotating Wall Vessel)60. Wei et al. also investigated effects of simulated weightlessness on human PBLs. Microgravity seemed to inhibit DNA replication and down-regulate DNA-repair gene, enhancing structural chromosome instability61. Moreover, Fuentes et al. found that the effect of microgravity in cardiovascular progenitors is age-dependent, since endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation markers were highly expressed in adults whereas neonatal progenitors acquired dedifferentiating cellular features62. In a recent study, Bisserier et al. investigated spaceflight effect on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from three astronauts’ blood plasma. Significant downregulation of miR-214, miR-128 and promotion of PRC2 complex activation and elevated H3K27me3 levels were observed in human cardiomyocytes during spaceflight, leading to epigenetic suppression of Vitamin D receptor expression63. The effects of altered gravitational conditions on lymphoblast leukemic cells and colorectal cancer cells were studied by Vidyasekar et al. (OSD-125, 10.26030/6dnk-x507). They reported multiple microgravity-induced consequences observed in both cell lines such as reduced cell viability, altered cell morphology and diverging cell cycle. Dysregulation of oncogenes and cancer progression markers (JUNB, CD44, MYC and CD117) were detected as well64. Comparative analysis of microgravity effects on musculoskeletal systems We present a differential gene expression analysis in response to microgravity vs control conditions. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions we generated volcano plots per each tissue which depict both the statistical significance and the level of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition to that, we evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the top over-expressed and under-expressed genes. Figure 1 shows volcano plots of all musculoskeletal mouse muscle microarray datasets from OSDR. These plots show the variation and diversity of differential gene expression results even between the same types of muscle. For example, Fig. 1b, g are both from gastrocnemius datasets but the differentially expressed genes and distribution are very different. Fig. 1.

The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the adjusted P value threshold of less than 0.05, highlighting genes with statistically significant expression changes.Figure 2 shows volcano plots for all human musculoskeletal microarray datasets from OSDR. Similar to the mouse datasets, there is widespread variation in both distribution and differentially expressed genes between datasets of the same tissue type. Fig. 2.

We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in four mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp (Fig. 4). We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. 5 and 6). Fig. 3.

Consequently, we proceeded with the computation of Pearson correlation coefficients for all these genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. First, we investigated the concordance of gene expression levels between two male human bedrest experiments studying vastus lateralis tissue (OSD-195 and OSD-370). The most notable difference between these two datasets is that OSD-195 studied 21 days of bedrest while OSD-370 studied 9 days of bedrest. The correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the gene-by-gene relationship between the two datasets. Our analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation with a coefficient of 0.47. This indicates that there is a tendency for the gene expression levels to increase together across the two experiments. We extended our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment, female human bedrest study which shared 1225 common unique genes with both OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments from the larger merged list of 17,402 genes. For OSD-51 compared to OSD-195, a correlation coefficient of 0.26 was observed, indicating a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels of the two experiments. Similarly, between OSD-51 and OSD-370, a correlation coefficient of 0.23 was found, also indicating a weak positive correlation. However, notably, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was significantly higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, even using the reduced number of genes, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that these two experiments exhibit more similar gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increase in correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 compared to the larger merged dataset (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Forest plot depicting the correlation coefficients for four comparisons including OSD-195 vs OSD-370, OSD-51 vs OSD-195, OSD-51 vs OSD-370, and OSD-195 vs OSD-370 from a larger merged dataset (17402 genes) in Homo sapiens. Open in a new tab The correlation coefficient for each comparison is represented by a black point on the line. The dashed vertical line at the center denotes the point of no correlation (correlation coefficient = 0). The confidence level employed for computing the confidence intervals (CIs) is configured to be 95%, equivalent to an alpha level of 0.05.We then examined the correlation coefficient between two mouse gastrocnemius datasets (OSD-21 and OSD-227), focusing on 12,385 unique common genes. The greatest difference between these two experiments is that OSD-21 studied female mice flown on an 11-day space shuttle flight while OSD-227 studied male mice subjected to hindlimb suspension for 24 h. The calculated correlation coefficient was close to 0.2, falling within the range of a weak positive correlation. We also calculated the correlation coefficient between OSD-227 soleus and OSD-111 soleus, where OSD-111 studied male mice flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for the shared genes between OSD-111 and OSD-227 was found to be 0.02 (Fig. 8). This correlation coefficient indicates minimal linear relationship between the gene expression patterns in the two experiments. Fig. 8. The figure displays the correlation coefficients for two comparisons including OSD-21 vs OSD-227 (Gastrocnemius), OSD-111 vs OSD-227 (Soleus) in Mus musculus. Open in a new tab The correlation coefficient for each comparison is represented by a black point on the line. The dashed vertical line at the center denotes the point of no correlation (correlation coefficient = 0). The confidence level employed for computing the confidence intervals (CIs) is configured to be 95%, equivalent to an alpha level of 0.05.Overall, we observe higher correlation coefficient between datasets which studied subjects of the same sex under similar experimental conditions. Several factors can contribute to the correlation coefficient, including biological variability, technical factors, and the complexity of gene expression regulation. Even with the same tissue and similar experimental conditions, gene expression can exhibit considerable variation between samples and experiments.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Studies from spaceflight and ground analog experiments confirmed that altered gravity environment causes multiple physiological alterations to both mouse and human musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system, including biological processes such as metabolism of skeletal muscle, bone formation response, inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation in PBLs, impaired activation of T cells, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle disruption in hair follicles, neuron morphogenesis, neuronal synaptic signaling and migration, cell morphology and diverging cell cycle in cancer cell lines. In our study, we initially incorporate all available literature data derived from the same tissue and organism with similar experimental conditions, without considering specific inclusion criteria. Subsequently, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients for all genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. Initially, we focused on Homo sapiens’ Vastus lateralis tissue. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation indicating a tendency for gene expression levels to increase together across OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments. We expanded our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment. We observed a correlation coefficient of 0.26, showing a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels between OSD-51 vs OSD-370, and OSD-51 vs OSD-195. However, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was notably higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, suggesting a more pronounced association and similarity in gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increased correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of common genes, indicates potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments, which may not be evident when considering the larger gene set. The calculated correlation coefficient between experiments regarding Mus musculus Gastrocnemius and Soleus tissues indicated weak positive and close to zero correlation, respectively. Furthermore, we were interested in characterizing how reproducible these experimental results are within each species. We focused on the musculoskeletal system for a comparative analysis because this physiological system contains the greatest number of comparable tissue types between human and mouse datasets. We evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly upregulated in 4 or more mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Lcn2, Pnmt, Fkbp5, and Cebpd. This analysis revealed a consistent trend of upregulation of several biological processes including protein binding, ubiquitin activity and transferase activity in mouse muscle tissues exposed to microgravity. We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in two mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp. This analysis shows consistent downregulation of several biological processes across experiments, including metal ion binding, DNA binding and RNA polymerase activity. Interestingly, several of the same biological processes were found to be associated with both upregulated genes and downregulated genes. We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. 5 and 6). There were fewer datasets to compare, and three upregulated and nine downregulated genes overlapped between datasets. The CHRND gene (associated with acetylcholine binding, acetylcholine receptor activity, acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel activity, ligand-gated ion channel activity), CHAD gene (related to protein kinase inhibitor activity), and RRAD gene (associated with GTP binding, GTPase activity, calmodulin binding, protein binding) were significant upregulated on two different human experiments, OSD-195 and OSD-370 both studying vastus lateralis tissue. The aforementioned experiments also share nine common downregulated genes MYOZ2 (associated with actin, and protein binding), COLQ (associated with protein binding), along with KLHL40, CA14, CASQ2, KLHL34, ACOT11, COQ10A, and PPP1R1C. Overall, in the human musculoskeletal datasets we find consistency in the biological process of protein binding. OSD-195 and OSD-370 have the greatest overlap, even though the other two datasets also studied the same tissue type. It was challenging to perform a direct comparison between the human and mouse results, due to the small sample size in the human datasets. However, we did note that the protein binding Gene Ontology term was related to several upregulated mouse and downregulated human genes. We assess gene expression results from a variety of tissues in both Mus musculus and Homo sapiens exposed to altered gravity in spaceflight or ground analogs. We report some overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed in musculoskeletal tissues within each species, and very limited overlap between species, partially due to the small amount of human samples. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our analysis, we took an inclusive approach by incorporating all relevant literature data derived from the same tissue and organism, with similar experimental conditions. This inclusive approach may help to identify potential patterns or trends across a wider range of studies, which may not be apparent when focusing solely on a subset of data. The elevated correlation observed between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of shared genes, implies the presence of potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments. Further research is needed to understand which differentially expressed gene signatures from Mus musculus are truly reflective of Homo sapiens response to altered gravity.",

Copyright notice ID: 11053165 PMID: 38671027 Abstract One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples. Subject terms: Databases, Molecular biologyIntroduction NASA GeneLab platform, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) constitutes an omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) interactive open-access database where users are able to upload, download, share, store and analyze data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. Approximately half of the datasets in the GeneLab repository consist of transcription profiling assays. The most prevalent transcription study assay type is microarray with RNA sequencing data being the fastest-growing assay in the database. Other assay types include genome sequencing, protein expression, metabolite profiling, epigenomics, metagenomics, and epitranscriptomics1,2. There are still many unknown mechanisms regarding the biological effects taking place during spaceflight. Discovering these mechanisms is essential for NASA’s goal to keep its astronauts healthy, especially with the planned human deep space exploration missions, which are near the horizon. From the very first space missions, it became evident that microgravity causes physiological changes to mammals, including significant abnormalities presented in the cardiovascular, immune, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems3,4. There are multiple and intricate hazards to human health and performance in spaceflight caused by a combination of environmental stressors such as gravitational alterations, ionizing radiation, high level of carbon dioxide, changes in diet and physiological stress. Appropriate countermeasures must be developed in order to effectively minimize the aforementioned impairments3,5–7. Due to the small size of the astronaut cohort and privacy concerns surrounding human data collection and sharing, most spaceflight data originate from model organisms rather than Homo sapiens. An example of a model organism is Mus musculus, a suitable model for studying the effects of altered gravitational conditions. Current knowledge of the effects of spaceflight is derived from experimental models in vivo, ex vivo (e.g., tissue) and in vitro (e.g., cell culture)8. Opportunities for actual microgravity experiments are rare and challenging to access due to the infrequency of spaceflights and the various associated restrictions, including expenses, equipment requirements, and the need for volunteers. Thus, space analogs, such as random positioning machines, clinostats, head-down bedrest, hindlimb unloading rodent model, and rotating wall vessel, have been developed aiming to simulate altered gravity conditions9–11. In this study, we review the effects of microgravity and other spaceflight environmental factors on Homo sapiens and Mus musculus based on microarray studies and experiments housed in the NASA GeneLab repository1,2. We primarily focus on experiments that have been conducted in either actual or simulated microgravity in order to determine the affected functionalities at the gene, cellular or organ levels.Results Review of effects of altered gravitational conditions on Mus musculus It has been shown that the central nervous system (CNS) of Mus musculus exhibits severe abnormalities after exposure to spaceflight. For example, neuroinflammation has been identified following ionizing radiation individually or combined with microgravity exposure12,13. Santucci et al. (OSD-33, 10.26030/7btg-6q49) studied the effects on gene and protein expression level in mouse brain tissue following a 3-month mission on the International Space Station (ISS). They found that the expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) was decreased in hippocampus, cortex and adrenal gland during spaceflight conditions, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) did not show consistent changes across the brain regions and the adrenal gland. Both proteins are involved in learning and memory via regulating neural plasticity. Genes related to various metabolic and catabolic processes were downregulated as well, while proteins related to mitochondrial and calcium metabolism, synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, and amino acid transportation were upregulated14. Frigeri et al. (OSD-32, 10.26030/jpyz-fn46) performed mRNA expression analysis in brain tissue of mice that were hindlimb-unloaded for 2 weeks. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a microgravity analog in which a rodent’s hind limbs are suspended and in disuse. Genes related to the transport of small molecules and ions into cells were upregulated in the HU group. An increased risk of venous thrombosis, as well as changes in functional pathways such as immune response, learning and memory performance, and cell junction were also noted15. Holley et al. (OSD-536, 10.26030/bg5q-t229) highlighted significant alterations in gene expression profiles associated with neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function in brain tissue of mice that were housed on the ISS for thirty-five days. In particular, genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated16. The detrimental consequences of microgravity exposure on the musculoskeletal system have also been extensively documented. Fitzgerald et al. (OSD-232, 10.26030/9626-w275) studied articular and sternal cartilage from mice that had experienced spaceflight conditions for 30 days. Genes that encode structural extracellular matrix components, such as Fmod, Ogn, Omd, Dcn, Dpt, Prelp, Col10a1, Tsp4, and Comp were downregulated in articular cartilage. Proteoglycan levels were lowered in the spaceflight articular cartilage, while there was no proteoglycan loss in the sternal cartilage. The authors concluded that this is because in microgravity, articular cartilage experiences near-complete biomechanical unloading, but sternal cartilage still experiences biomechanical loading17. Gambara et al. (OSD-135, 10.26030/rjyq-x751) found that in longissimus dorsi from mice flown for 30 days on the BION-M1 biosatellite, genes linked to insulin sensitivity and metabolism of skeletal muscle were significantly dysregulated, while myofiber cross-sectional area and myosin heavy chain subtype patterns were not altered18. Chakraborty et al. (OSD-396, 10.26030/ce4f-xx71) examined the procedure of bone fracture healing (using a segmental bone defect model) in mice housed on the ISS for 4 weeks. Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of callus tissue after spaceflight indicated increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity, while an apoptosis and cellular morbidity gene-network signal was activated in the spaceflight callus tissue compared to controls19. Gambara et al. (OSD-111, 10.26030/9580-9n52) assessed changes in gene expression in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus following 30 days on the BION-M1 capsule. They identified differentially expressed genes related to key biological processes such as contractile machinery, calcium homeostasis, muscle development, cell metabolism, and inflammatory and oxidative stress response8. Based on data from the same mice, Blottner et al. studied the Homer gene, which is thought to be downregulated during muscle atrophy. They found the short Homer1a isoform was upregulated, while the long Homer2 isoform was downregulated in the soleus muscle after microgravity exposure. This isoform sensitivity appears to be regulated by muscle activity or inactivity at the neuromuscular junction20. Däpp et al. (OSD-228, 10.26030/bfmx-z866) examined transcriptome alterations in soleus tissue of mice that underwent hindlimb suspension (HLS). HLS is a microgravity analog in which a rodent’s hind limbs are suspended, resulting in disuse similar to microgravity exposure. They found increased myogenic factors, contractile genes, and metabolic genes during reloading, as well as indications that sarcomere regulation is sensitive to mechanic loading21. Flück et al. recommended that especially in tissue plasticity studies, we should normalize gene expression levels using tissue-relevant references (e.g., muscle weight, volume, nuclear content)21,22. Mazzati et al. (OSD-227, 10.26030/vk0m-0558) also used HLS to detect differential expression of genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism in soleus and gastrocnemius tissue23. Allen et al. (OSD-21, 10.25966/c36b-3g68) stated that spaceflight significantly alters expression of gastrocnemius tissue genes that are associated with muscle growth (e.g., phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85a, MAFbx/atrogin1, insulin response substrate-1, and forkhead box O1 transcription factor) and muscle fiber type24. Furthermore, weightlessness causes a decrease in bone formation by osteoblasts and an increase in osteolytic functions of osteoclasts. Pardo et al. examined gene expression profiles of 2T3 preosteoblast cells to find genes particularly sensitive to gravity changes, and found that simulated microgravity downregulated alkaline phosphatase, run-related transcription factor 2, osteomodulin and parathyroid hormone receptor 1, while cathepsin K was upregulated25. Patel et al. (OSD-30, 10.25966/90vx-bf79) compared preosteoblast exposure to two different simulators of altered gravity: Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Machine. They found similar results from each method, including altered expression of the same 14 skeletal remodeling genes. In particular, they found inhibited alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity in both, demonstrating that both methods inhibit preosteoblast differentiation, consistent with microgravity-induced bone mass decrease. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PthR1) involved in calcium mobilization and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) associated with skeleton development (e.g., cartilage formation) were downregulated in the Rotating Wall Vessel conditions26. The role of parathyroid hormone-related protein was also studied by Camirand et al. (OSD-107, 10.26030/2x2z-6w28) using trabecular and calvarial cells. They confirmed that PthR protein has anti-apoptotic function under microgravity, and as a result it could be defined as an anabolic agent to prevent cell death in trabecular osteoblasts27. Uda et al. (OSD-324, 10.26030/s7kj-h383) studied altered gravity effects on osteocytic cell line Ocy454 for 2, 4 and 6 days onboard the ISS, concluding that glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption were increased during spaceflight28. Wang et al. (OSD-547, 10.26030/y2af-c498) examined gene expression profiles of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 under simulated altered gravitational conditions via large gradient high magnetic field, showing that this environment affected the expression of genes related to enzyme, peptide, G-protein coupled receptors and glucose metabolic process29. Sambandam et al. (OSD-18, 10.25966/j6hy-d340) investigated the differentiation procedure of osteoclasts using a rotary cell culture system to simulate microgravity. In particular, they highlighted increased expression of genes associated with enhanced osteoclast differentiation and function, such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signaling proteins30. Osteoblast precursors such as Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) are sensitive to mechanical loading. Monticone et al. (OSD-29, 10.25966/6rr8-r017) studied murine BMSC cultures that were onboard the ISS for 8 days, while half of them were stimulated with osteo-inductive medium. They found that cell proliferation was inhibited in spaceflight conditions and that differentially expressed genes were related to neural development, neuron morphogenesis, transmission of nerve impulse and synapse31. Ortega et al. (OSD-50, 10.26030/69kd-nx87) differentiated murine bone marrow cells (mBMC) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF) for 14 days during spaceflight, detecting significant increase in cell proliferation and differential expression of genes related to the coagulation pathway. They found that the macrophages that differentiate during spaceflight express slightly different markers, and that the post-spaceflight population may be slightly more differentiated32. In addition, Chapes and Ortega (OSD-50, 10.26030/69kd-nx87) highlighted the importance of ground-based experiments before spaceflight in order to assess macrophage differentiation33. Astronauts suffer from skin dryness, itching, coarsening of epidermis and decreased skin elasticity. Neutelings et al. (OSD-61, 10.26030/2zjp-sj35) reported a fifteen percent reduction of dermal thickness of cutaneous tissue collected from mice exposed to spaceflight conditions for 90 days. They also reported deregulated hair follicle cycle and upregulated myogenesis34,35. Mao et al. (OSD-116, 10.26030/ya5a-e896) confirmed the increased risk for pathophysiology damage and carcinogenesis in skin tissue during a 13-day spaceflight mission as they observed upregulation in cellular antioxidants, ROS production and tissue remodeling36. Weightlessness induces severe effects on the immune system as well. Lebsack et al. (OSD-4, 10.25966/qq9p-pc28) reported alterations in the expression of genes regulating stress, T-cell signaling activity and glucocorticoid receptors following the exposure of mice to spaceflight for 13 days. In particular, Rbm3, Ctla-4, IFN-a2a genes were upregulated and Hsph110, Hsp90aa1, Cxcl10, Strip1, Fkbp4m, and CD44 genes were downregulated in the thymus tissue of spaceflown mice37. Beheshti et al.38 utilized the NASA GeneLab database to analyze transcriptomic data from different rodent datasets (e.g., OSD-4, 10.25966/qq9p-pc28, OSD-21, 10.25966/c36b-3g68, OSD-25, 10.25966/kzxa-s692, OSD-48, 10.26030/jq04-0n51, OSD-61, 10.26030/2zjp-sj35, OSD-63, 10.26030/gsmt-8e70, OSD-111, 10.26030/9580-9n52), revealing critical genes, signaling pathways and circulating micro-RNA signatures as key biomarkers for astronauts’ health. Particularly, they identified TP53 and transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-β1) as the most prevalent regulators across all tissues, and TGF-β1 was the most connected gene across all tissues, suggesting it is a key driver gene for spaceflight response34.Review of effects of altered gravitational conditions on Homo sapiens Experiments of human muscle tissue exposed to microgravity validated the aforementioned findings concerning the musculoskeletal system’s vulnerability to altered gravity. Chopard et al. (OSD-51, 10.26030/3w73-jn41) examined gene expression profiles of soleus and vastus lateralis muscles during long-term (60 days) bedrest conditions, as well as evaluating potential countermeasures such as protein supplementation and combined resistance-aerobic exercise. They reported an induction of metallothioneins, genes involved in antioxidant stress response, in the non-countermeasures groups. They also reported limited counteracting effects of the nutritional countermeasure, while aerobic training significantly counteracted the negative effects on muscle metabolism39. Rullman et al. (OSD-198, 10.26030/kcrr-p336) added the hypoxia variable into the equation, studying effects on micro-RNA (miRNA) expression of horizontal bedrest with normal level of oxygen, bedrest in hypoxia, and ambulation in hypoxia. Few miRNAs were modestly differentially regulated, such as let-7, miR-15, miR-25, miR-199, and miR-133, thus only minor alterations could be detected. The Planetary Habitat Simulation study aimed to clarify biological effects of prolonged (21-day) musculoskeletal unloading combined with hypoxia. Rullman et al. (OSD-195, 10.26030/r6bv-rk07) identified upregulation of genes associated with denervation (e.g., acetylcholine receptor subunit delta and perinatal myosin) and a robust inhibition of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family40,41. Alibegovic et al. (OSD-370, 10.26030/zyy0-6497) investigated muscle biopsies taken from healthy young men before and after bedrest, in basal or insulin-stimulated states collected from vastus lateralis as well. They confirmed downregulation of mitochondrial function pathways and increased muscle insulin resistance induced by bedrest conditions, which were only partially recovered after muscle retraining42. In addition, several studies have aimed to determine how human bone marrow stem cells react and differentiate in altered gravitational conditions. Mayer-Wagner et al. (OSD-124, 10.26030/6fwd-2p79) studied how chondrogenesis is affected during simulated reduced gravity and low-frequency electromagnetic fields, concluding that microgravity conditions significantly downregulated COLXA1, COL2A1, and aggrecan, representing decreased chondrogenic potential43. Bradamante et al. (OSD-546, 10.26030/mg6a-qv31) examined the effects in terms of growth and differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) housed on the ISS for 2 weeks. They identified upregulation of genes that are related to osteogenesis (BGLAP, CHRDL1, and SPP1) and metabolism of steroid hormones and vitamins A, D pathway (CYP19A1, CYP24A1, AKR1B1, HSD11B1). Cell proliferation, motility and cell-cell communication seemed also to be affected as evidenced by downregulation of CSNK2A2, ITGAV, NRCAM, and NRP2, while the RAB27b gene associated with microvesicle formation was significantly upregulated. Moreover, they reported stemness loss, no evidence of apoptosis or senescene, notable upregulation of collagen genes, and notable downregulation of matrix metallopeptidases44. Terada et al. (OSD-174, 10.26030/6sg0-ng36) analyzed data from a JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) experiment conducted on a 6-month mission on the ISS, where both hair follicles and shafts were collected from ten astronauts. They reported altered expression of genes associated with cell cycle disruption in hair follicles (e.g., COMP and CDK1) and hair growth (e.g., ANGPTL7 and FGF18)45. Zhang et al. (OSD-118, 10.26030/rcyt-qp10) investigated miRNA expression in non-proliferating human fibroblast cells in response to spaceflight environment (ISS). Minor effects were observed on gene or miRNA expression on day 14, whilst most of the differentially expressed genes were related to cell growth on day 3 (see ref. 46). Lu et al. (OSD-114, 10.26030/yssj-bg68) studied human fibroblasts housed on ISS with and without treatment of bleomycin (a compound which induces DNA damage), to better understand the effects of microgravity on cellular DNA damage response. Although several genes were altered between treatment and control groups in flight and on Earth, including some of the same genes, there was no significant change when comparing flight treatment to Earth treatment. The authors also concluded that cell type and cell growth condition influence whether microgravity affects DNA damage response47. Spaceflight causes profound effects on lymphocyte functions that are well documented. Ward et al. (OSD-5, 10.25966/qq4z-4m04) detected ten downregulated genes (e.g., GNLY, PSME2, PrX4, HLA-DRA, LY75, IL18, and DOCK2) related to immune response in activated T lymphocytes that were exposed to simulated microgravity (Rotating Wall Vessel) for 24 h48. Chang et al. (OSD-13, 10.26030/4an8-r968) studied T cells housed on the ISS and stimulated with the T-cell mitogen ConA and anti-CD28. They found impaired T-cell activation as well as profound downregulation of Rel/NF-κB, CREB, SRF and immediate early genes’ expression, indicating very early effects of microgravity on T-cell gene expression49. Boonyaratanakornkit et al. (OSD-484, 10.26030/semj-9y19) revealed that Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key regulator factor regarding NF-κB, AP-1, CREB and T-cell activation in simulated microgravity50. Thiel et al. (OSD-189, 10.26030/r0md-de60, OSD-172, 10.26030/jx41-b816, OSD-188, 10.26030/3jq1-s218) identified ATP6V1A/D, IGHD3-3/IGHDE-10, and LINC00837 as genes that are significantly affected by gravity, as they investigated non-activated human Jurkat T cells in both microgravity and hypergravity conditions. They also found that chromosomal region 11p15.4 seems to be particularly robust to altered gravity51,52. Vogel et al. and Tauber et al. focused on the effects of altered gravity on immune signaling, as captured by the OSD-283 (10.26030/ge2v-wr94) and OSD-297 (10.26030/bb5k-1h18) datasets. In particular, Vogel et al. identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) as a potential pharmacological target for counteracting deterioration of immune system, and PDK1 as sensitive in Jurkat T and U937 myelomonocytic cells exposed to altered gravitational conditions. In addition, Tauber et al. described well-regulated homeostasis and transcriptional stability of oxidative stress-related pathways53,54. U937 myelomonocytic cells were also studied by Thiel et al. (OSD-283, 10.26030/ge2v-wr94, OSD-297, 10.26030/bb5k-1h18), who detected significant gene expression alterations after only 20 s of altered gravitational conditions (both microgravity and hypergravity). However, all initially differentially expressed transcripts adjusted rapidly afterward, verifying the existence of immediate adaptation mechanisms55. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs seem to regulate effects, associated with apoptosis and immune response, in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells under simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation according to Fu et al. (OSD-545, 10.26030/7ta4-ga35)56. Chakraborty et al. (OSD-54, 10.26030/8mfb-wa73) customized a cell culture module for human dermal microvascular endothelial cell growth in order to examine the impact of spaceflight environment on endothelial cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. They found that long-term lipopolysaccharide exposure resulted in a delayed host response, inefficient in pathogens’ potential invasion57. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells’ exposure to microgravity showed significant altered transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation, stress response, cell cycle and apoptosis. Findings from Versari et al. (OSD-52, 10.26030/nt3p-p547) suggested that microgravity affects inflammatory response and endothelial behavior, while promoting senescence58. Girardi et al. (OSD-55, 10.26030/9thk-dv75, OSD-56, 10.26030/nc96-xp67, OSD-128, 10.26030/73sd-9a85, OSD-129, 10.26030/sec3-y188) examined mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) exposed to simulated microgravity through a miRNA-mRNA integration analysis, detecting effects on inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation decrease59. Let-7i, miR-7, miR-7-1, miR-27a, miR-144, miR-200a, miR-598, and miR-650 were found to be deregulated in human PBLs exposed to radiation and simulated microgravity (Rotating Wall Vessel)60. Wei et al. also investigated effects of simulated weightlessness on human PBLs. Microgravity seemed to inhibit DNA replication and down-regulate DNA-repair gene, enhancing structural chromosome instability61. Moreover, Fuentes et al. found that the effect of microgravity in cardiovascular progenitors is age-dependent, since endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation markers were highly expressed in adults whereas neonatal progenitors acquired dedifferentiating cellular features62. In a recent study, Bisserier et al. investigated spaceflight effect on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from three astronauts’ blood plasma. Significant downregulation of miR-214, miR-128 and promotion of PRC2 complex activation and elevated H3K27me3 levels were observed in human cardiomyocytes during spaceflight, leading to epigenetic suppression of Vitamin D receptor expression63. The effects of altered gravitational conditions on lymphoblast leukemic cells and colorectal cancer cells were studied by Vidyasekar et al. (OSD-125, 10.26030/6dnk-x507). They reported multiple microgravity-induced consequences observed in both cell lines such as reduced cell viability, altered cell morphology and diverging cell cycle. Dysregulation of oncogenes and cancer progression markers (JUNB, CD44, MYC and CD117) were detected as well64.Comparative analysis of microgravity effects on musculoskeletal systems We present a differential gene expression analysis in response to microgravity vs control conditions. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions we generated volcano plots per each tissue which depict both the statistical significance and the level of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition to that, we evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the top over-expressed and under-expressed genes. Figure 1 shows volcano plots of all musculoskeletal mouse muscle microarray datasets from OSDR. These plots show the variation and diversity of differential gene expression results even between the same types of muscle. For example, Fig. 1b, g are both from gastrocnemius datasets but the differentially expressed genes and distribution are very different. Fig. 1.

Genes with a log2-fold change above 1 are represented in red, signifying upregulated expression, while genes with a log2-fold change below −1 are depicted in blue, indicating downregulated expression. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the adjusted P value threshold of less than 0.05, highlighting genes with statistically significant expression changes.Figure 2 shows volcano plots for all human musculoskeletal microarray datasets from OSDR. Similar to the mouse datasets, there is widespread variation in both distribution and differentially expressed genes between datasets of the same tissue type. Fig. 2.

The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the adjusted P value threshold of less than 0.05, highlighting genes with statistically significant expression changes.We then evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly upregulated in four or more mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Lcn2, Pnmt, Fkbp5, and Cebpd (Fig. 3). We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in four mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp (Fig. 4). We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. 5 and 6). Fig. 3.

Consequently, we proceeded with the computation of Pearson correlation coefficients for all these genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. First, we investigated the concordance of gene expression levels between two male human bedrest experiments studying vastus lateralis tissue (OSD-195 and OSD-370). The most notable difference between these two datasets is that OSD-195 studied 21 days of bedrest while OSD-370 studied 9 days of bedrest. The correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the gene-by-gene relationship between the two datasets. Our analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation with a coefficient of 0.47. This indicates that there is a tendency for the gene expression levels to increase together across the two experiments. We extended our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment, female human bedrest study which shared 1225 common unique genes with both OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments from the larger merged list of 17,402 genes. For OSD-51 compared to OSD-195, a correlation coefficient of 0.26 was observed, indicating a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels of the two experiments. Similarly, between OSD-51 and OSD-370, a correlation coefficient of 0.23 was found, also indicating a weak positive correlation. However, notably, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was significantly higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, even using the reduced number of genes, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that these two experiments exhibit more similar gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increase in correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 compared to the larger merged dataset (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Forest plot depicting the correlation coefficients for four comparisons including OSD-195 vs OSD-370, OSD-51 vs OSD-195, OSD-51 vs OSD-370, and OSD-195 vs OSD-370 from a larger merged dataset (17402 genes) in Homo sapiens. Open in a new tab The correlation coefficient for each comparison is represented by a black point on the line. The dashed vertical line at the center denotes the point of no correlation (correlation coefficient = 0). The confidence level employed for computing the confidence intervals (CIs) is configured to be 95%, equivalent to an alpha level of 0.05.We then examined the correlation coefficient between two mouse gastrocnemius datasets (OSD-21 and OSD-227), focusing on 12,385 unique common genes. The greatest difference between these two experiments is that OSD-21 studied female mice flown on an 11-day space shuttle flight while OSD-227 studied male mice subjected to hindlimb suspension for 24 h. The calculated correlation coefficient was close to 0.2, falling within the range of a weak positive correlation. We also calculated the correlation coefficient between OSD-227 soleus and OSD-111 soleus, where OSD-111 studied male mice flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for the shared genes between OSD-111 and OSD-227 was found to be 0.02 (Fig. 8). This correlation coefficient indicates minimal linear relationship between the gene expression patterns in the two experiments. Fig. 8. The figure displays the correlation coefficients for two comparisons including OSD-21 vs OSD-227 (Gastrocnemius), OSD-111 vs OSD-227 (Soleus) in Mus musculus. Open in a new tab The correlation coefficient for each comparison is represented by a black point on the line. The dashed vertical line at the center denotes the point of no correlation (correlation coefficient = 0). The confidence level employed for computing the confidence intervals (CIs) is configured to be 95%, equivalent to an alpha level of 0.05.Overall, we observe higher correlation coefficient between datasets which studied subjects of the same sex under similar experimental conditions. Several factors can contribute to the correlation coefficient, including biological variability, technical factors, and the complexity of gene expression regulation. Even with the same tissue and similar experimental conditions, gene expression can exhibit considerable variation between samples and experiments.Discussion Studies from spaceflight and ground analog experiments confirmed that altered gravity environment causes multiple physiological alterations to both mouse and human musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system, including biological processes such as metabolism of skeletal muscle, bone formation response, inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation in PBLs, impaired activation of T cells, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle disruption in hair follicles, neuron morphogenesis, neuronal synaptic signaling and migration, cell morphology and diverging cell cycle in cancer cell lines. In our study, we initially incorporate all available literature data derived from the same tissue and organism with similar experimental conditions, without considering specific inclusion criteria. Subsequently, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients for all genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. Initially, we focused on Homo sapiens’ Vastus lateralis tissue. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation indicating a tendency for gene expression levels to increase together across OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments. We expanded our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment. We observed a correlation coefficient of 0.26, showing a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels between OSD-51 vs OSD-370, and OSD-51 vs OSD-195. However, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was notably higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, suggesting a more pronounced association and similarity in gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increased correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of common genes, indicates potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments, which may not be evident when considering the larger gene set. The calculated correlation coefficient between experiments regarding Mus musculus Gastrocnemius and Soleus tissues indicated weak positive and close to zero correlation, respectively. Furthermore, we were interested in characterizing how reproducible these experimental results are within each species. We focused on the musculoskeletal system for a comparative analysis because this physiological system contains the greatest number of comparable tissue types between human and mouse datasets. We evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly upregulated in 4 or more mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Lcn2, Pnmt, Fkbp5, and Cebpd. This analysis revealed a consistent trend of upregulation of several biological processes including protein binding, ubiquitin activity and transferase activity in mouse muscle tissues exposed to microgravity. We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in two mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp. This analysis shows consistent downregulation of several biological processes across experiments, including metal ion binding, DNA binding and RNA polymerase activity. Interestingly, several of the same biological processes were found to be associated with both upregulated genes and downregulated genes. We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. 5 and 6). There were fewer datasets to compare, and three upregulated and nine downregulated genes overlapped between datasets. The CHRND gene (associated with acetylcholine binding, acetylcholine receptor activity, acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel activity, ligand-gated ion channel activity), CHAD gene (related to protein kinase inhibitor activity), and RRAD gene (associated with GTP binding, GTPase activity, calmodulin binding, protein binding) were significant upregulated on two different human experiments, OSD-195 and OSD-370 both studying vastus lateralis tissue. The aforementioned experiments also share nine common downregulated genes MYOZ2 (associated with actin, and protein binding), COLQ (associated with protein binding), along with KLHL40, CA14, CASQ2, KLHL34, ACOT11, COQ10A, and PPP1R1C. Overall, in the human musculoskeletal datasets we find consistency in the biological process of protein binding. OSD-195 and OSD-370 have the greatest overlap, even though the other two datasets also studied the same tissue type. It was challenging to perform a direct comparison between the human and mouse results, due to the small sample size in the human datasets. However, we did note that the protein binding Gene Ontology term was related to several upregulated mouse and downregulated human genes. We assess gene expression results from a variety of tissues in both Mus musculus and Homo sapiens exposed to altered gravity in spaceflight or ground analogs. We report some overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed in musculoskeletal tissues within each species, and very limited overlap between species, partially due to the small amount of human samples. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our analysis, we took an inclusive approach by incorporating all relevant literature data derived from the same tissue and organism, with similar experimental conditions. This inclusive approach may help to identify potential patterns or trends across a wider range of studies, which may not be apparent when focusing solely on a subset of data. The elevated correlation observed between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of shared genes, implies the presence of potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments. Further research is needed to understand which differentially expressed gene signatures from Mus musculus are truly reflective of Homo sapiens response to altered gravity.Methods Data and literature mining We identified all the microarray studies and datasets housed in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) by applying the following search filters: “Assay Type: Microarray”, “Tissue: All”, “Factor: All”, “Organisms: Mus musculus OR Human (Homo sapiens)”. The search was limited to studies published up to January 2023 to ensure the inclusion of the most recent research. We obtained the following datasets: OSD-4, OSD-18, OSD-21, OSD-29, OSD-30, OSD-32, OSD-33, OSD-50, OSD-61, OSD-79, OSD-80, OSD-87, OSD-88, OSD-89, OSD-93, OSD-94, OSD-107, OSD-109, OSD-111, OSD-116, OSD-117, OSD-131, OSD-135, OSD-148, OSD-153, OSD-156, OSD-158, OSD-159, OSD, 160, OSD-183, OSD-202, OSD-222, OSD-232, OSD-227, OSD-228, OSD-324, OSD-342, OSD-396, OSD-432, OSD-455, from Mus musculus and OSD-5, OSD-9, OSD-13, OSD-51, OSD-52, OSD-54, OSD-55, OSD-56, OSD-71, OSD-73, OSD-78, OSD-92, OSD-114, OSD-115, OSD-118, OSD-124, OSD-125, OSD-128, OSD-129, OSD-130, OSD-140, OSD-149, OSD-152, OSD-151, OSD-154, OSD-155, OSD-157, OSD-172, OSD-174, OSD-175, OSD-176, OSD-178, OSD-182, OSD-188, OSD-189, OSD-195, OSD-198, OSD-283, OSD-285, OSD-297, OSD-317, OSD-354, OSD-367, OSD-368, OSD-369, OSD-370, OSD-410, OSD-484, OSD-542, OSD-544, OSD-545, OSD-546 from Homo sapiens. Furthermore, the GeneLab repository federates search with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of  (). The GeneLab repository encompasses the entirety of the relevant datasets present in the GEO database. A more comprehensive search had to be done though using the following query: ”(microgravity OR spaceflight OR gravity) AND “Homo sapiens”) and ”(microgravity OR spaceflight OR gravity) AND “Mus musculus”) and applying the following filter criteria: “Study type: Expression profiling by array”. Academic research databases, such as PubMed, and ScienceDirect were also used with the keywords “microgravity and microarray”, “spaceflight and microarray”, “gravity and microarray” and “weightlessness and microarray”. Because GeneLab ingests datasets from GEO and provides an option to search through the GEO database, no new datasets were found in this search, but research articles found in this search were used to inform the discussion section in this manuscript. We describe the differences and similarities between the findings of the original studies for each tissue type in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens.Differential gene expression comparative meta-analysis on the musculoskeletal system We also performed a comparative meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes from transcriptomics datasets between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, specifically concentrated on the musculoskeletal system (Fig. 9). This choice was driven by the fact that the musculoskeletal system encompasses a wide range of tissue types that are highly comparable between human and mouse datasets. By focusing on this physiological system, we aimed to evaluate the consistency of findings and identify commonly upregulated and downregulated genes within each species, as well as between the two species. Fig. 9. An overview of the effects of altered gravity environment on various physiological aspects in both mouse and human systems incudes musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system alterations. Open in a new tab Comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species.To demonstrate the concordance on a gene-by-gene level between experiments we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient between gene counts in different datasets from the same tissue type. To avoid duplicate genes per experiment we calculated the average expression value for each common gene and removed null values. To identify differentially expressed genes that are reproducible between experiments, we focused on experiments which fulfill these inclusion criteria: (1) case–control study, (2) derived from musculoskeletal tissue of the same species, (3) untreated samples, (4) microgravity vs control group comparison. We identified in each study genes which were differentially expressed between microgravity-exposed samples and control samples with an adjusted P value (Benjamini–Hochberg method) threshold of below 0.05 and |log2FC| threshold above 1, which reflects a substantial change in gene expression. The data preprocessing and differential expression analysis procedures were conducted using the R programming language. Normalization was performed using the affy or oligo packages in the R Bioconductor environment65–67. Specifically, for the Affymetrix datasets, we employed the Robust Multiarray Analysis (RMA) algorithm through the R/Bioconductor packages affy and oligo which performs background correction, log2 transformation, quantile normalization, and the summarization of all probe sets into a single expression value for each gene. For the Agilent datasets, we performed normalization using the R/Bioconductor package limma. Following this preprocessing pipeline, each normalized dataset underwent quality control checks, incorporating an outlier removal approach. Quality control procedures were executed using the R/Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics, which involved generating boxplots of logarithm ratios, PCA and MA plots. Any samples identified as outliers in both MA and PCA plots during the quality control assessment were excluded from their respective datasets.Acknowledgements This work was supported by both the Fulbright Foundation in Greece and the Fulbright Program fellowship.Author contributions Conceptualization: K.I.A. and S.V.C.; methodology: K.I.A. and S.V.C.; investigation: K.I.A., L.M.S., and S.V.C.; writing—original draft preparation: K.I.A. and L.M.S.; data curation: K.I.A.; formal analysis: K.I.A., L.M.S., and S.V.C.; algorithms implementation: K.I.A. and L.M.S.; writing—review and editing: K.I.A., L.M.S., and S.V.C.; supervision: S.V.C.; project administration: S.V.C.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Data availability Data used in the preparation during the current research article were obtained from NASA GeneLab Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; osdr.nasa.gov/bio).

From Skylab and the Space Shuttle Program to the NASA Balloon Program and the International Space Station National Lab, these programs generated priceless data that continue to paint a vibrant picture of life in space. These data are available to the scientific community in various data repositories, including the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and NASA GeneLab. Here we recognize the 30-year anniversary of data access through ALSDA and the 10-year anniversary of GeneLab. Keywords: space biology, NASA, data, open science, data archive, FAIR, omicsBackground Space travel involves inherent hazards, including altered gravity, increased exposure to radiation, confinement, and distance from Earth [1]. Characterizing and mitigating these risks is the focus of the Thriving in Deep Space (TIDES) initiative, part of NASA’s Space Biology Program within the Biological and Physical Sciences Division. NASA’s upcoming Moon to Mars Missions will face increased health hazards [2]. TIDES aims to meet these challenges by investigating biological responses to the space environment and utilizing this knowledge to enhance biotechnological systems essential for human health and performance beyond low Earth orbit. Open and FAIR [3] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data are paramount for supporting these efforts by enabling scientific collaboration and gaining new knowledge. This view of data stewardship in the modern era is embraced by NASA and its Science Mission Directorate (SMD), which launched the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative and released Science Policy Directive SPD-41a [4]. Data collection and archiving has been a key principle at NASA for decades. Here we recognize the 30-year anniversary in 2024 of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), a database of experiment descriptions, payloads, missions, telemetry, results, and bioimaging data mostly from NASA-funded life sciences investigations. Similarly, 2024 marks the 10-year anniversary of NASA GeneLab, the omics repository for space biology and space-relevant experiments. In 2021, ALSDA and GeneLab merged to form the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), unifying these precious data resources under 1 platform [5].History and 30-Year Anniversary of the NASA ALSDA The work to create the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) began in 1990 by teams at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Ames Research Center (ARC), and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). It was established and fully funded in FY94 with archive centers at ARC, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), JSC, and GSFC. ARC focused on nonhuman data, JSC on human data, KSC on plant data, and GSFC provided Master Catalog functions. In 1995, LSDA was tasked with providing representation for Space Life Sciences to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and International Standards Organization (ISO) efforts to develop a reference model for the emerging challenge of archiving digital data. For 10 years, ALSDA led the Space Life Sciences effort for this ambitious endeavor. The resulting CCSDS/ISO product “The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model” is the most widely adopted archival standards framework [6]. The repository was designed around experiments with relational links to personnel, hardware, payloads, missions, and so on. ALSDA was charged with collecting all ARC-funded life sciences experimental data and metadata to allow scientists to perform retrospective analyses across missions, experiments, disciplines, and research subjects/species. ALSDA began capturing hardware information, audio/visual media, images, slides, mission and payload information, experiment descriptions, raw experimental data, and raw telemetry downlink and ground control data in both analog and digital formats. Years later, ALSDA was tasked with creating and managing the biospecimen storage facility, capturing, cataloging, and disseminating biospecimens remaining from flight and ground experiments. Faced with growing demands for open-access and high-quality data, ALSDA was unable to upgrade systems until it merged with the modern GeneLab data system [7] in 2021. As a result, this integration now maximizes science-return on all legacy and future data collections. In 2024, ALSDA remains responsible for curating, archiving, and making available space-relevant phenotypic, physiological, bioimaging, behavioral, and environmental telemetry datasets. Collection of scientific reports and publications was streamlined to other program-level repositories such as Taskbook and PubSpace.History and 10-Year Anniversary of NASA GeneLab The early 2000s saw a paradigm shift in biological research, wherein costs of high-throughput sequencing dropped precipitously and large omics datasets were generated at an increasing rate. “Omics” refers to a group of biological disciplines that study comprehensive datasets of related molecules in an organism, such as genomics (DNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and transcriptomics (RNA), to understand complex biological systems and processes. In 2011, the National Academies’ Decadal Survey in Life and Physical Sciences Research emphasized the importance of omics, advocating for informatics technologies and a multilevel, systems biology approach for space biology research [8]. In keeping with the 2011 Decadal Survey recommendations, NASA initiated the GeneLab project in 2014. From the 2014 GeneLab Strategic Plan, the goal was to allow maximally open and unrestricted access to omics data generated from biological experiments in space, as well as associated experimental metadata. A critical first step for GeneLab was to establish meticulous normalization standards to provide “rich metadata” using the ISA (Investigation, Study, Assay) model framework for data curation, thereby enhancing the FAIRness of these data [3]. In 2018, GeneLab established the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), composed of data repository users and scientists. Together, they defined optimal analytical workflows for data, resulting in consensus bioinformatics pipelines to process and standardize all raw omics data, significantly enhancing dataset reusability by eliminating the need for downloading terabytes of raw sequencing data or having specialized bioinformatics expertise. Building on this foundation of standardized metadata and processed data, GeneLab recently released a visualization portal enabling users to effectively visualize experimental processed omics data. Over the past decade, GeneLab has evolved into a sophisticated data system with a single point of entry for scientists to upload their data, expedite the curation of new datasets, search the database, download raw and processed data via a web browser or API, and visualize data using state-of-the-art tools. GeneLab is also fostering a vibrant scientific community through its AWGs, which regularly conduct meta-analyses, make new discoveries, and enhance the repository. These groups have been producing independent publications for many years through the reuse of data, culminating in the release of 2 major space biology paper collections [1, 9]. Additionally, GeneLab now serves as the omics repository for the European Space Agency’s SciSpacE research program, integrating European data through NASA’s portals.The Open Science Data Repository: Best of Both Worlds The integration of ALSDA with GeneLab [5] has resulted in the creation of OSDR, which is built on GeneLab’s robust framework and incorporates data and metadata from both databases. This integration has improved data accessibility and reusability through new tools and workflows, enabling the merging of multimodal and multihierarchical data from spaceflight experiments for enhanced knowledge discovery and mission support. The consolidation has standardized and made data from ALSDA searchable and maximally openly accessible, while also enhancing GeneLab’s omics data by linking it transparently with non-omics data from the same experiments. Including over 20 years of ALSDA’s legacy data, along with valuable payload, mission, and hardware records, OSDR now hosts over 500 studies across all life forms, from microbes to animals, plants, and humans, each with curated metadata and accessible raw and processed data files. Additionally, the repository contains over 300 records related to payloads, missions, and hardware. The AWG ecosystem has rapidly expanded, gaining over 300 new members in the past year and fostering the creation of new groups that contribute valuable insights to OSDR. Notably, subject matter experts from the ALSDA AWG have helped establish minimum data requirements and metadata standards for over 60 assay types on OSDR, many of which previously lacked standards. Additionally, the new artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning AWG has been instrumental in enhancing the readiness of OSDR data for machine learning and AI applications. This group also played a key role in summarizing a NASA workshop focused on the use of AI to enable self-driving laboratories, automated science, and precision space health in future space missions [10].Conclusions A paradigm shift has occurred in modern space biosciences, where reliable data reuse is now essential, as well as science being interdisciplinary, inclusive, and maximally transparent. To enable large communities of scientists on Earth to participate in spaceflight discovery, NASA plays a leading role in this shift through a strong open science program.

    "title": "Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513672/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Aim: Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation.

While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”?Methods: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1flox/flox; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells.Results: In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility.Conclusion: Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.Keywords: caveolin-1, lymph propulsion, lymphatic contractility, lymphatic permeability, nitric oxideINTRODUCTION Lymphatic vessels complete the circulatory loop by transporting away fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells that have extravasated into the interstitium from blood vessels. As such, lymphatic vessels maintain tissue homeostasis by regulating fluid balance and modulating immunity1. Lymph uptake and propulsion is increasingly appreciated as critical in health and disease2. The structure of lymphatic vessels is well-suited for these roles. Initial lymphatic capillaries have overlapping button-like junctions that permit passive entry of fluid and large molecules3. Downstream collecting lymphatic vessels have tight, zipper-like junctions, unidirectional valves, and are covered with lymphatic muscle cells that demonstrate intrinsic contractility: all to help transport lymph from the periphery4. Lymph transport is further aided by extrinsic movements to move lymph through collecting vessels. From the initial uptake of fluid through its downstream transport, there are many potential regulators of lymphatic transport function. Caveolae are plasma membrane domains, stabilized by the caveolin family of proteins5, that play a role in cellular endo- and exocytosis, mechanosensing, and receptor localization that are particularly enriched in adipocytes and endothelial cells5,6. Mice lacking Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the most abundant and most studied isoform, are viable and have served as a murine model to study the wide array of roles caveolae play across different tissues7. In endothelial cells, Cav-1 mediates trans- versus paracellular protein transport8. Increased fluid and protein flux across the blood endothelium has been measured in Cav-1 null mice9 due to either increased pore formation and elevated capillary pressure8 or increased paracellular (and hence, less actively regulated) transport9,10. In endothelial cells caveolae also play multiple roles in nitric oxide (NO) regulation11. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are also enriched in Cav-112,13. What role caveolae play in lymphatic transport remains largely unknown. The initial uptake of fluid and macromolecules into lymphatics has long been viewed as a mostly passive process due to the structure of lymphatic capillaries and their overlapping “leaf-like” cell junctions. In vitro studies using primary LECs identified that inhibition of dynamin, and hence active transendothelial transport, reduced albumin and dextran flux across LEC monolayers13 similar to the effects seen in blood endothelium14. Whether capillary LECs actively filter solutes during uptake from the interstitium is unknown. Collecting lymphatic vessels have, however, demonstrated fluid filtration from transported lymph and a regulated permeability to larger proteins in vivo15. The contractility and permeability of these vessels is also highly dependent on NO activity16,17. With pronounced effects in blood endothelium and the roles caveolae play in active transport and NO regulation, we hypothesized that lymphatic transport in Cav-1 deficient mice would likely be impacted. To test this hypothesis we utilized mice with a global deletion of Cav-1 (“CavKO”) and mice with a LEC-specific deletion of Cav-1 (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1flox/flox; “LyCav”) and measured lymphatic transport through a series of physiological assays. Quantitative microlymphangiography in vivo and isolated LEC monolayers in vitro were used to examine initial lymphatic function, while collecting vessel transport, permeability, and contractility were measured in vivo and ex vivo. We find that loss of Cav-1 impacts fluid and macromolecule transport in multiple ways along the length of the lymphatic vasculature.RESULTS Dermal lymphatic characteristics in CavKO mice When CavKO were first generated one of the first phenotypes characterized was a change in blood vascular endothelial cell density in some tissues and increased vessel permeability in others10,14. Despite blood vessel leakiness being previously reported to be elevated in several tissues as judged by infused Evan’s blue dye extravasation10, following the same protocol, we measured a significant increase in Evan’s blue levels only in the dermis of CavKO mice (Fig. 1a). We thus focused our examination on the skin. Changes in blood vessel permeability alter interstitial fluid dynamics and indeed, we measured a significant increase in tissue hydration in the dermis of CavKO mice (Fig. 1b). The total collagen content of the dermis was also significantly increased (Fig. 1c). Micropuncture was used to measure the hydrostatic interstitial fluid pressure and it was significantly elevated in the tail skin of CavKO mice (Fig. 1d). Elevated dermal blood capillary permeability thus results in increased skin tissue water and interstitial fluid pressure.

(i) Average lymphatic vessel width in mouse ear skin. n=12 WT, 12 KO. * p<0.05, † p<0.01, ‡ p<0.001 compared to WT.We examined the lymphatic vessel architecture in the skin of CavKO mice and identified no marked visual differences (Fig. 1e). Lymphatic patterning was quantified in the ear skin of CavKO mice; no difference in lymphatic vessel density based on the length/area (Fig. 1f) or branches/area (Fig. 1g) were measured. Patterning (branches/length) was also not different in CavKO mice (Fig. 1h). Vessel width was also equivalent between genotypes (Fig. 1i). Thus, the macroarchitecture of the lymphatic capillary network was similar in CavKO mice to age-matched wildtype cousin controls.Lymphatic transport in CavKO mice To measure the effects of global caveolin-1 deletion on lymphatic capillary function a previously described microlymphangiography method that affords a quantitative, intravital measurement of lymphatic conductance was applied to CavKO mice18,19 (Fig. 2a). The method utilized simultaneously calculates lymphatic conductance, the volume of fluid taken up per volume of tissue per pressure per time, and the tissue’s hydraulic conductivity using 70kDa dextran (large enough to necessitate lymphatic over venous uptake20) by comparing the fluid infusion rates at low pressures to the distance of a visualized convective front. The measured dermal interstitial fluid pressures were applied to the measurements to increase their accuracy as described in the model19,21. In line with the increased water content of the CavKO mouse dermis, a significant increase in tissue hydraulic conductivity was measured in the model (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the lymphatic conductance was significantly increased in CavKO mice at nearly twice that of wildtype mice (Fig. 2c). Lymphatic macromolecule uptake from the interstitium was therefore not impaired in the absence of caveolin-1.

(j) Flux of 70 kDa dextran from cannulated flank lymphatic vessels (normalized to the bath fluorescence before pressure was applied) at baseline and following sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment. * p<0.05, † p<0.01, ‡ p<0.001 compared to WT.To quantify the appearance rate of tracer in the lymph node, we utilized near infrared scanning of anesthetized mice following a footpad injection of indocyanine green. Interestingly, we did not observe an increase in signal at the popliteal lymph node 30 minutes after injection in CavKO mice (Fig. 2d). Quantifying the signal over time demonstrated that the tracer rapidly appeared in the lymph node of wildtype mice, reaching a maximum intensity at 15 minutes, however CavKO mice never demonstrated an increase in signal (Fig. 2e). With increased lymphatic capillary uptake, yet no downstream appearance, we investigated whether lymphatics were leaky in CavKO mice. Dermal lymphatic endothelial cells were isolated from WT and CavKO mice and grown to monolayers on transwell membranes in a geometry to test luminal to abluminal transport (Fig. 2f). CavKO LECs demonstrated a significantly higher permeability to 70kDa dextran overall (Fig. 2g), a relationship that stood when normalizing to the flux of a smaller 3kDa dextran as well (Fig. 2h). A trend of similar magnitude toward increased trans-lymphatic flux of 70 kDa dextran was also measured in CavKO isolated flank collecting vessels (Fig. 2i), though this did not reach significance (Fig. 2j). The addition of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside increased the flux of both CavKO and WT vessels. There were no differences in flux of 3kDa dextran from the vessels. Thus, while a small increase in macromolecule permeability may be present in CavKO lymphatics, the lack of tracer reaching the node was unlikely due to vessel leakiness alone.Reduced contractility in CavKO vessels To further investigate failed downstream lymphatic transport in CavKO mice, we repeated the near infrared tracer studies using 70kDa FITC-conjugated dextran. Similar to the findings on the near infrared imaging, the amount of dextran reaching the popliteal lymph node of mice under isoflurane anesthesia was significantly reduced, but not zero, in CavKO mice (Fig. 3a). The appearance in the node and potential collecting vessel leakiness were also visualized under a fluorescence-equipped stereomicroscope. As the quantified nodal content indicated, little fluorescence was visible in the lymph node of CavKO mice 15 minutes following injection (Fig. 3b). The collecting vessels along the lower leg, however, did have some signal, though no obvious leakage was observed (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, when we physically manipulated the tissue, the tracer movement appeared to increase. We thus tested dextran transport in conscious mice, with free mobility for the 15 minutes following injection: the total amount of dextran in the popliteal nodes of CavKO and wildtype mice was then equivalent (Fig. 3d). With extrinsic movement providing lymph propulsion to the popliteal node in CavKO, which had been significantly depressed in immobile mice, it therefore appeared that CavKO mouse lymphatics lacked intrinsic contractility typically seen in these vessels 22. Figure 3: Open in a new tab Collecting lymphatic vessel transport and contractility in the absence of caveolin-1.

The flank vessels of WT mice exhibited modest intrinsic pumping at the pressures tested averaging ~2 contraction/minute (Fig. 3e; Supp Video 1). The vessels of CavKO mice demonstrated markedly reduced contractility with significantly fewer contractions at 4cm of pressure (with and without luminal shear) (Fig. 3e). The contractions present in the CavKO vessels were also notably weaker with significantly limited amplitude (Fig. 3f; Supp Video 2). Vessel valves and α smooth muscle actin coverage appeared to be normal in CavKO vessels (Fig. 3g) and the vessel diastolic diameters were similar to WT vessel in size in pressure changes (Fig. 3h). In an additional experiment to test the impact of reducing NO, L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, was applied. No significant impact on contractility was measured in WT vessels (Fig. 3e). As seen previously when NO levels are too high in other lymphatics vessels17, the addition of L-NAME was able restore some intrinsic contractility in CavKO vessels with a significant increase in contraction frequency measured at 1cm and 4cm of pressure (Fig. 3e); however, contractile amplitude was still reduced compared to WT and L-NAME did not increase the amplitude of contraction (Fig. 3f). Reduced intrinsic phasic contractility, partially mediated through excessive NO production, could thus account for the reduced transport measured in CavKO mice.Lymphatic-specific deletion of Cav1 recapitulates the lymphatic phenotypes of CavKO mice The interstitial fluid that becomes initial lymph begins with fluid extravasation from the blood. With altered blood extravasation in CavKO mice, we thus sought to isolate the physiological effects of caveolin-1 deletion to lymphatic endothelium alone by generating lymphatic-specific Cav1 null mice. Lyve1-Cre mice were crossed to Cav1flox/flox mice to generate mice with a constitutive lack of caveolin-1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LyCav; Supp Figure 1) and tested in a similar group of studies as the CavKO mouse experiments. Unlike in CavKO mice, LyCav mice demonstrated no difference in Evan’s blue dye extravasation in the dermis, or any tissue, compared to Cre−/− littermate controls (Fig. 4a). This normalized blood side effect was mirrored in the normal dermal tissue hydration (Fig. 4b), which had been elevated in CavKO mice. Dermal collagen content was also unchanged in LyCav mice (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the hydrostatic interstitial fluid pressure was significantly increased in LyCav mice (Fig. 4d) suggesting that this is a lymphatic-driven phenomenon. Like in the CavKO mice, lymphatic conductance was significantly elevated in LyCav mice (Fig. 4e). The hydraulic conductivity, highly dependent on tissue hydration, was normal relative to Cre−/− littermates in LyCav mice (Fig. 4f). Lymphatic capillary patterning was quantified in the ear skin of LyCav mice and, similar to the CavKO mouse, no difference in lymphatic vessel density based on the length/area (Fig. 4g) or branches/area (Fig. 4h) were measured. Patterning (branches/length) was also not different in CavKO mice (Fig. 4i). Vessel width was also similar (Fig. 4j).

The amount of dextran quantified within the node was significantly less 15 minutes after injection in these mice (Fig. 4l). In ambulatory mice, however, the amount of dextran reaching the node was normalized (Fig. 4m). Contractility of the flank collecting vessel was tested in LyCav mice and the experimental results were similar to CavKO vessels (Supp Video 3). LyCav vessel contraction rate was reduced but could be rescued to a significant degree by reducing NO production with L-NAME (Fig. 4n; Supp Video 4). Vessel valves and α smooth muscle actin coverage appeared to be normal in vessels from LyCav mice (Fig. 4o) and the contractile amplitude was only 20% in LyCav vessels and could not be increased with L-NAME (Fig. 4p). Likewise, L-NAME did not change vessel diastolic diameters (Fig. 4q). The intrinsic contraction rate and amplitude of lymphatic collecting vessels thus appears to be in part dependent on lymphatic endothelial cell caveolar functions.DISCUSSION Here we demonstrate that caveolae are involved in multiple process that control various aspects of lymphatic function. CavKO mice demonstrated increased albumin extravasation, tissue hydration, collagen content, and interstitial fluid pressure in the dermis. The lymphatic capillaries in these mice appear normal in the dermis, but interstitial fluid and macromolecule clearance is increased. Similarly, CavKO LECs demonstrate increased permeability. Intrinsic lymph propulsion through collecting lymphatic vessels in CavKO mice, however, is nearly absent. These phenomena are similar in mice with LEC-specific Cav1 deletion. CavKO mice have previously demonstrated increased blood capillary albumin extravasation10,14, in the present study we found this only to be significant in the dermis. The tissue water content, interstitial fluid pressure, collagen content, and hydraulic conductivity were also increased in CavKO mice, indicative of a lymphedema-like phenotype18. Interestingly, however, we measured the lymphatic conductance of the tissue to be significantly elevated in CavKO mice. Combined, these findings suggest either altered venous reuptake or that the increased lymphatic fluid clearance is insufficient to compensate for the altered blood-side changes in the global KO. The microlymphangiography results and blood extravasation of Evan’s blue both utilize albumin or an albumin-sized dextran molecule such that these transport mechanisms may be more important for macromolecule transport than water flux alone. With blood and venous permeabilities presumably normal in the LyCav mice, however, interstitial fluid pressure was also significantly elevated as in CavKO mice, further supporting a lymphatic transport defect. In these mice, the water content and hydraulic conductivity were normal compared to their littermates, but lymphatic conductance was still elevated. The high hydrostatic interstitial pressure may help to drive the low-pressure infused dextran tracer to the lymphatics resulting in the appearance of increased lymphatic capillary transport in both the global CavKO and LyCav mice. Micropuncture was used in this study to measure interstitial fluid pressure; use of another method, such as wick-in-needle could yield different values and thus alter the calculation of hydraulic conductivity and lymphatic conductance19,23. Interstitial changes in these mice may also be due to changes in other cells types; other cells dependent on Cav1 would be impacted in the CavKO mice, and LyCav mice may have mosaic deletion in another cell types, or the floxed loci in exon3 might alter endogenous caveolin-1 function. While it will be interesting to uncover the mechanisms of transvascular and interstitial fluid movement in these mice, in both models macromolecule transport across the lymphatic capillary wall is increased when LECs lack caveolae. Active caveolae-mediated transport across LECs has been reported to be a mechanism by which LECs control solute transport. Triacca and colleagues demonstrated that transcellular albumin and 70 kDa dextran were highly localized with caveolae in LECs13. When active transport was blocked via dynamin inhibition, uptake of these solutes was reduced by approximately 80%13. Dynamin activation, and its interaction with caveolae, is critical for transendothelial albumin transport24. The effective permeability of LECs to albumin was thus significantly reduced by dynamin inhibition and it was concluded that transcellular transport is important in lymph formation and that it is actively modulated by LECs13. LECs isolated from the dorsal skin of CavKO mice demonstrated increased apical-basal permeability to 70 kDa dextran compared to WT LECs, suggestive of the increased paracellular transport reported in CavKO blood capillaries10. LEC junctions are critically important in fluid and macromolecule uptake, but whether these junctions are different in CavKO lymphatic capillaries was not identified. Another study identified that while caveolae may be important for active transport of some molecules, fenestrae formation, and the active transport of antibodies, these were not appreciably different in CavKO mice25,26. Transcellular transport may therefore be highly specific to the solute, system used, and direction for which the tests are performed. With increased endothelial permeability reported in blood vessels of CavKO mice, we tested this in isolated lymphatic collecting vessels. These vessels are shown to have a regulated permeability to albumin in other studies16. CavKO vessels only demonstrated a trend toward increased leakiness for 70 kDa dextran and not to the extent of the increased flux across CavKO monolayers. Thus, lymphatic capillaries may have increased solute uptake in CavKO mice, but the collecting vessels may have an increased loss of the solute out of the vessel. Only minimal amounts of dextran or indocyanine green reached the draining lymph nodes in CavKO and LyCav mice under anesthesia after 15 or even 45 minutes. As this was measured using two different tracer molecules, the previously reported negative impacts on lymphatic function by indocyanine green do not appear to have impacted this study result27. Rantakari and colleagues also noted reduced dextran in CavKO lymph node conduits 2 minutes after a subcutaneous injection as part of an antigen trafficking study26. This is disconnected from our measurement that peripheral lymphatic conductance significantly increased dextran clearance from the dermis. Interestingly, intrinsic phasic lymph propulsion was nearly absent in both CavKO and LyCav popliteal vessels. Lymph was able to move only in awake, mobile animals or through tissue massage. Net lymph transport in these models therefore requires either intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms to drive lymph flow downstream of lymphatic capillary uptake. Using isolated vessel studies, we identified that when caveolae are missing from LECs the intrinsic phasic contractile response of the collecting vessels was greatly reduced and that those contractions noted were of minimal amplitude. Of the many differences between lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, the intrinsic contractility of lymphatic collecting vessels is a unique physiological feature that drives net lymph propulsion. Movement of lymph from the periphery, or its lack thereof, is a critical component not only of lymphatic disorders such as lymphedema, but also in novel lymphatic dysfunctions observed as in obesity or diabetes2. To date, human mutations in CAV1 have not yet been associated with lymphatic defects, but rather with lipodystrophy and pulmonary hypertension28,29. Many factors that regulate blood vascular tone, however, also impact lymphatic tone and contractility, such as luminal flow rates, sympathetic signaling, calcium flux, and nitric oxide activity; these regulatory mechanisms often have caveolae as a critical component. CavKO mouse blood vessels demonstrate markedly elevated NO levels and up to three times the downstream cGMP activity resulting in more relaxed, more permeable vessels10,30. Restoring caveolin-1 protein to CavKO endothelial cells could rescue some of the vasorelaxation and improve the NO responses needed for endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor propagation31. L-NAME suppression of NO synthesis also reduces blood vessel permeability in CavKO mice10. Lymphatic vessel permeability is also tightly regulated by NO levels16. While the isolated vessel permeability elevation in response to additional NO were not significant, dysfunctional NO signaling had profound effects on the contractility of lymphatic vessels lacking caveolae. Both CavKO and LyCav vessels demonstrated significantly reduced phasic contractile frequency, and those contractions were of small amplitude. High levels of NO have been previously shown to marked reduce lymphatic vessel contractility17. Inhibiting NO synthase in vessels lacking Cav1 had a significant effect on increasing phasic contractility. The effects measured here in CavKO and LyCav vessels demonstrate that LEC caveolae play a role NO regulation and, therefore, intrinsic vessel contractile response. Caveolae also play other roles that could impact vessel contraction beyond NO regulation proper. An excellent review of these mechanisms is covered by Billiaud and colleagues11. For example, dysregulated coordination of the contractile response through altered location and activity of connexins and TRPV4 channels was identified in CavKO mouse blood endothelium32. TRPV4 currents are predominant in lymphatic endothelium33 and connexins are necessary for the proper development and function of the lymphatic vasculature34. Indeed, mutations in connexin genes result in human primary lymphedema34, and lymphatic-specific loss of connexins 37 or 43 result in dysfunctional lymphatic valves and fluid back-leak in mice35. These proteins would not be absent in CavKO mice, but their location and modulation is changed in endothelial cells32. Beyond the demonstrated NO effect, we have not identified if these other cellular regulators of the contractile response are altered in lymphatics in these models, but they likely play additional roles in the impaired contractility measured in collecting lymphatic vessels lacking caveolae. In conclusion, we have identified that caveolae play multiple roles in lymphatic functions and that deletion of Cav-1 has a dichotomous effect on different regions of the lymphatic network. While fluid or macromolecule uptake may be increased in the initial, peripheral lymphatic capillaries, there is a downstream impairment of collecting vessel intrinsic capabilities when caveolae are absent. These findings thus not only identify how caveolae impact lymphatic physiology, but also highlight some of the critical mechanisms by which lymphatics maintain tissue homeostasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice CavKO mice: Cav-1 null mice on an FVB background were acquired from the laboratory of Philipp Scherer at UT Southwestern Medical Center who maintained mice originally acquired from the Lisanti group36. Mice were maintained by intermittently breeding to wildtype FVB/NJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock: 001800) and breeding and reselecting for knockout mice. Systemic deletion of Cav-1 was identified by PCR and confirmed by western blotting with WT cousins used as controls. LyCav mice: Lyve1-Cre mice were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (stock: 012601) and backcrossed to wildtype FVB/NJ mice for over 6 generation before crossing to FVB Cav1flox/flox mice37. LyCav mice were continually backcrossed and maintained on an FVB/NJ background. Due to Lyve-Cre mice demonstrating germline activity from males, male Lyve1-Cre−/− Cav1flox/flox mice were crossed with female Lyve1-Cre+/− Cav1flox/flox mice to generate experimental cohorts. Systemic lack of recombination of the loxP-flanked caveolin exon was verified by PCR in all Cav1flox/flox mice used for breeding and experiments (Supp Fig 1). All mice were maintained in AAALAC approved facilities with ad libitum access to food and water. Male and female mice, aged 16-20 weeks, were used in equal proportions for all experiments as indicated. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX).Dermal lymphatic imaging and quantitation Dermal sheets of mouse ears were prepared as previously38. Sheets were immunolabeled for LYVE-1 (goat anti-mouse; R&D Systems) and Cav-1 (rabbit anti-mouse; Cell Signaling) with appropriate fluorescent secondary detection. LYVE-1 labeling was first imaged on a green fluorescence-equipped Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V12 microscope for vessel quantitation. LYVE-1 and Cav-1 imaging together was performed on an Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). To quantify lymphatic vessel morphology, a defined area of clear vessel visualization was outlined in ImageJ software. The number of lymphatic branches within that area was then counted. The total length of vessels was traced through a thin sheet of paper using the ImageJ freehand tool and a pen (the paper keeping record of what was done). The total number of branches, total length, and the number of branches per total length are reported to demonstrate lymphatic density and branching in the skin. Widths were measured across all vessels crossing at a line drawn 100 mm from the ear edge.Interstitial fluid pressure measurementsW Dermal interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was measured with a servo-null pressure system (IPM model 4A) using a protocol similar to published previously39. Mice were maintained under ketamine:xylazine (87:13 mg/kg) anesthesia with a core body temperature at approximately 37°C. A tail section between 20-30 mm from the tip/base was then visualized using an upright intravital microscope (Olympus BX61WI) for a total magnification of x400. Following calibration, a thin-wall glass micropipette (tip size ~1μm) was carefully inserted ~50-60 μm below the epidermis surface and the pressure data were acquired at 1000 Hz rate using a data acquisition system (PowerLab and LabChart 8 Pro, ADInstruments). Pressure measurements were accepted only if they satisfied the criteria detailed previously40,41. These criteria included that: 1) the pressure recording was insensitive to small changes in the feedback gain, 2) a slight withdrawal of the pipette resulted in decrease in recorded pressure verifying a seal between the pipette and surrounding tissue as well as the open pipette tip, 3) the recorded pressure returned to previous steady state level following slight repositioning of the pipette tip, and 4) the pressure recording returned to zero when the pipette was removed from the tissue.Fluorescence microlymphangiography A noninvasive, quantitative model for evaluating lymphatic uptake and tissue hydraulic conductivity in the mouse was developed previously19. This fluorescence microlymphangiography-based method has been previously employed by the authors18,42. Briefly, a 2mg/ml 70kDa FITC-dextran solution was infused at low pressure into the tip of the mouse tail over a range of pressures. The infusion flow rate and characteristic convective length in the mouse tail were monitored under a green fluorescence-equipped Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V12 microscope over 30 minutes per pressure; 30 minutes is sufficient to reach steady-state with the interstitial pressure as required by the model18,19. The measured IFP for each strain was applied to the calculations for lymphatic conductance (the volume of infused fluid removed from a volume of tissue space per time per pressure, or 1/min/mHg) and tissue hydraulic conductivity (mm2/min/mmHg). Mice were maintained under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia in groups of 3 on a heating pad maintaining a rectally-monitored core body temperature of 37°C for up to 2.5 hours. Genotypes were randomized by position for each round.Evans Blue extravasation Evan's Blue Dye (Sigma) was injected intravenously to restrained mice at 25mg/kg. One hour after injection mice were perfused with 20mL PBS and tissues extracted. Tissues were weighed and placed in 1mL formamide (Sigma) for 48 hours. Evans Blue absorbance of the extract was measured spectrophotometrically at 610nm. Results are reported as absorbance units per mg tissue normalized to the wildtype tissue.Tissue water and collagen content After the animals were euthanized, the back-skin hair was removed and an excised piece of skin was weighed in a glass culture tube. The tissue was then heated at 80°C overnight to dry it and reweighed to calculate the water lost. The dried tissue was oxidized in HCl and hydroxyproline content was determined as previously as an analogue to tissue collagen content21.Primary LEC isolation, culture, and transwell permeability Back skin taken from 3-week-old CavKO and FVB mice was transferred to Cell Biologics, Inc. (Chicago, IL) for primary LEC isolation. The provided P4 LECs were seeded directly into 3.0 μm pore size 6.5 mm Transwell polyester membrane inserts (Corning) at 2x105 cells per well and cultured for 7 days in full endothelial cell media (Cell Biologics) supplemented with 50 ng/mL human recombinant VEGF-C (R&D Systems). An equivalent seeding density was cultured in wells of a coverslip chamberslide for imaging and to visualize when cells had formed a connected monolayer. 12.5 μg/mL 3kDa Texas Red dextran (Fisher) and 70 kDa FITC dextran (Fisher) was applied to the top well and media from the top and bottom wells was collected at 6 hours. 3 kDa dextran served as the monolayer integrity control. Fluorescence concentrations were measured on a fluorescence plate reader and calculated by comparison to dextran standard curves prepared in culture media. Permeability was calculated as previously13. Chamberslides were immunolabeled for LYVE-1 and caveolin-1 and imaged on an Eclipse E600 microscope.Lymph node fluorescence uptake Following a brief anesthesia induction (5% isofluorane) mice were injected in the right footpad with 10μl of 2 mg/ml 70 kDa FITC dextran. For awake studies, mice were returned to their cage for 15 minutes. For anesthesia studies, mice were maintained under 2% isoflurane for 15 minutes. At the end time, mice were euthanized under anesthesia and the right popliteal lymph node removed. The left popliteal node was also removed and served as a contralateral fluorescence control. Nodes were homogenized in 100 μl RIPA buffer and the fluorescence was measured on a fluorescence plate reader. The mass of dextran (μg) present in the node was calculated by comparison to a standard curve of dextran prepared in lymph node homogenate. Presence of the fluorescent dextran was also visualized at termination by carefully resecting the leg skin to image the lymphatic vessel and node in situ on a fluorescence stereoscope.IVIS Near infrared imaging Popliteal lymph node uptake was visualized and quantified over time using near infrared imaging of indocyanin green (Sigma). Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were shaved, placed into the IVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer), and 10 μl of indocyanine green solution (0.15mg/ml in saline) was injected in to the left food pad. The injection site was covered and mice were imaged at 5-minute intervals for 45 minutes. The radiant efficiency (signal over background at a given light power over a ROI; the ROI size was equal across all mice) at the site of the popliteal lymph node was quantified over time in Living Image Software v4.1.Isolated vessel permeability Inter-nodal inguinal axillary collecting lymphatic vessels were isolated from mice as previously described22. Vessels were cannulated on glass pipettes on the upstream side of the vessel, filled with 10 mg/mL 70kDa and 3kDa dextran solution, and the downstream opening of the vessel was ligated using ophthalmic suture in a chamber adapted from previous work 43. Pressure in the vessel was raised to 5cm of water pressure and the bath was changed 3 times and then filled with 1mL of room temperature PBS to minimize spontaneous contractile activity which would impact pressure within the vessel, and an image was taken of the vessel. Vessels that had visible leaks were not used. Samples of the bath (10uL) were taken every 10 min for 30 min. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was then added to the bath (final concentration of 100μM) and samples taken for an additional 30 minutes. All fluorescent intensity data for each vessel was normalized to t=0 values and vessel area for that vessel. The slopes (area corrected fluorescence/time) of pre- (10-30min) and post (40-60min) SNP addition were calculated for each vessel. A separate set of vessels were isolated and labeled with antibodies against VEGFR-3 (goat anti-mouse; R&D Systems) and α smooth muscle actin (mouse anti-mouse; Invitrogen), followed by secondary detection, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope.Isolated vessel contractility The flank lymphatic vessel (inguinal-axillary) was isolated as described22 under deep isoflurane anesthesia and placed into a warmed Kreb’s buffer with 10 g/L BSA. The vessel was cannulated and tied on to two pulled glass pipettes (80-100 μm in diameter) as previously performed on mesenteric vessels44. A small positive pressure of 2-3 cmH2O was applied to check for leaks and the vessel was set to its approximate length at the time of isolation at 1 cmH2O for equilibration at 34°C. Experimental data was recorded at 1, 3, and 5 cmH2O and with a 3 cmH2O pressure gradient to induce flow (5.5 – 2.5 cmH2O) over a period of 5 minutes at each pressure following a 3-minute equilibration. This was then repeated with the same vessels in the presence of 100 μmol L-NAME. Studies were recorded as previously44 and the total contractions counted manually and expressed as contractions/minute. Because CavKO vessels contracted infrequently and with minimal amplitude, any coordinated movement was counted for all vessels, regardless of genetic background. The phasic contractile amplitude was calculated as previously and diastolic diameters at each pressure reported44.Statistical Analyses and Data Presentation All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software. Nearly all analyses were tested by an unpaired, parametric t-test with Welch’s correction. p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. IVIS scan data were tested by two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak post hoc analysis. All data are presented as individual samples +/− standard deviation. All materials submitted conform with good publishing practice in physiology45.Supplementary Material SupportingInfo MS1745158-supplement-SupportingInfo.pdf (770.2KB, pdf) Supp Video 4Isolated, cannulated flank lymphatic vessel of a Cre+ mouse from the LyCav lineage.

    "abstract": "Abstract Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.

    "introduction": "Introduction In the upcoming decades, human activity in space will rapidly expand both in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond to an estimated $1.4 trillion dollar industry1. NASA’s Artemis missions, which will send humans back to the moon, includes a lunar orbiting space station (The Lunar Gateway) as well as a lunar surface habitat, and will all be a stepping stone to sending humans to Mars2. In addition, private companies, such as Starlab Space, LLC and Blue Origin, are building commercially owned and operated space stations with support from NASA’s commercial LEO destination initiative3. The rapid increase in the number of people living and working in space will require careful spacecraft design to support human health and wellbeing. One critical aspect of this design is to understand the microorganisms within a spacecraft. The International Space Station (ISS) has been a continuously inhabited confined environment in LEO since November 2000, and over 12,000 microbial species have been identified onboard4. The ISS is a closed system and the microbes primarily originate from the astronauts onboard5, as all humans have a distinct associated microbial ecosystem6. Other potential microbial sources on the ISS include plant experiments being grown onboard7, as well as those from the original construction materials. The ISS has its own unique microbiome, as does every human-occupied indoor environment on Earth. Similar to Earth-based indoor environments8, many of these microbes can reside in the dust generated onboard the ISS9. This is due to the high nutrient content in dust that microbes can utilize, with moisture being the limiting factor for growth10,11. Bacterial communities from ISS dust and other Earth-based confined environments such as clean rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units each contain a similar core microbial community12, although there are some significant differences between environment types13. Whether in space or on Earth, it is critical to maintain microbial communities indoors that support human health14. For instance, health effects on Earth are associated with microbial growth15, and thus it is critical to prevent this growth by controlling indoor moisture. Although, NASA standards for nominal relative humidity conditions on the ISS is between 25 and 75%16, there are pockets of elevated moisture present due to astronaut hygiene, exercising, in food areas, and in plant habitats. This study also provides insight into how microbial communities will react to unintended conditions such as a ventilation system failure or fire suppression event. There have also been reported issues reported on the ISS due to unintended microbial growth such as crewmember infections17 and destruction of plants onboard18. However, we need an improved understanding of how the microbial communities on the ISS compare to typical occupied spaces on Earth, and how these communities change under unexpected adverse conditions such as excess moisture. The goal of this study is to determine similarities and differences between microbial communities and growth under elevated moisture conditions in occupied spaces on Earth and the ISS. Here, we leverage raw sequencing data from two previous studies with nearly identical methods that have performed microbial analyses on dust collected from the ISS19 and from Earth-based residential homes20. These studies have a special focus on indoor fungi and characterize what happens when ideal growth conditions occur such as the introduction of elevated moisture conditions. This is a unique one-to-one comparison as methods were performed in the same laboratory, therefore all incubation, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics protocols are almost identical. Key differences between the studies were the presence of dust in carpet for Earth-based samples and different starting dust mass concentrations (50 mg for Earth-dust and 25 mg for ISS dust). The ISS is a complex environment that serves as an astronaut home, workplace, and transportation environment. While it can’t be distinctly classified as only one of these, we chose the residential home comparison because people on Earth spend most of their time in their home and to emphasize that astronauts are spending all their time in the spacecraft, including during sleep. This comparison of Earth- and space-based microbiomes in continuously occupied indoor environments will help us gain a better understanding of how the unique conditions experienced during spaceflight may alter microbial communities. As humanity becomes more active in space, the need to define what a healthy microbiome is in human occupied spacecraft will grow ever more important. These results can inform both Earth-based and future space-based indoor spaces on how microbial communities may change to identify any potential problems that may arise when unintended microbial growth occurs in these environments.",
    "methods": "Methods Overview This study aims to understand the differences between the indoor microbiomes of Earth-based residential buildings and dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS). Specifically, ISS dust and residential carpet with dust previously collected from homes in Ohio were incubated under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework19,20. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from these incubated samples, sequenced with Illumina MiSeq, and analyzed with a bioinformatics pipeline to determine taxonomy. Dust samples All ISS dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypo-allergenic filter system Oreck# PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard which the astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. Briefly, ISS dust samples were triple sealed in plastic bags until they could be returned to Earth, where all experiments were conducted. A detailed breakdown of ISS dust sample collection dates can be found in our previous study19. Earth carpet and dust samples were collected in residential homes throughout Ohio, USA in a previous study20. Briefly, dust was collected from the homes vacuum bags and carpet was removed directly from the same homes. The dust was embedded into carpet collected from the same home using ASTM method F609-13 after which incubations were then performed. After incubations, the dust was vacuumed from the carpet using Eureka Mighty Mite with adapter for a 19 mm × 90 mm Whatman cellulose thimble. The previous study had sampled 19 residential homes and for comparison to ISS dust, 4 of these homes were randomly selected to correspond to the 4 total ISS vacuum bags collected. Incubations For both studies, incubations occurred in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25°C covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape. Salt solutions were made to simulate 50% and 85% ERH conditions, while Deionized (DI) water was used for 100% ERH conditions19,20. Onset® HOBO® Data loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA USA) to monitor ERH and temperature conditions inside the incubation chamber. ISS Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish19. In comparison, Earth dust samples were sieved to 300 μm and embedded in 10 cm × 10 cm carpet squares for incubation. We do not anticipate any significant impact with the carpet and ISS dust as they are very similar in structure due the linty, fibrous nature of the ISS dust. Earth and ISS samples were exposed to varying elevated ERH conditions using the time-of-wetness framework previously outlined20, which refers to the time fraction per day that relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold33. Briefly, samples were incubated between 50% ERH and elevated (85% ERH)/saturated (100% ERH) conditions for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day. ISS Samples were extracted and quantified at day 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25 mg dust sample per day per bag)19, while Earth samples were analyzed at day 0, 5, 10, and 14 after vacuuming approximately 50 mg of dust from carpet squares20. DNA extraction and sequencing DNA was extracted from dust samples for both studies using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture34 (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads). Each DNA extraction run included a blank and was confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at -20℃ until use. Sequencing for all samples was performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ at RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). For fungal sequencing ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) ribosomal DNA primers35, while bacteria used 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5’-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) primers with 2 × 300 bp sequencing reads. Differential abundance analyses used total fungal and bacterial quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) values measure at the kingdom level as previously described11,20. To quantify fungal concentration, we targeted the 18S rRNA gene with forward primer (FF2) 5′-GGTTCTATTTTGTTGGT TTCTA-3′, and reverse primer (FR1) 5′-CTCTCAATCTGTCAATCCTTATT-3′36. For bacteria we targeted the 16S rRNA gene with forward primer 5’-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3’, reverse prime 5’-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3’, and PROBE (6-FAM)-5’CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3’-(BHQ)36–38. For the purposes of this study, we compared a randomly selected 4 out of 19 sites from the Earth-based study to the 4 ISS bags for varying ERH comparison and included samples from the original dust as well as at day 5, 10, and 14 for all ERH conditions. For original dust samples, all available samples were used which included a total of 15 samples (one per home as available) from the Earth-based study compared to 4 total ISS samples (with three replicates per ISS vacuum bag). Bioinformatics The raw sequencing files were extracted from both previous studies at NASA’s GeneLab database (OSD-694, GLDS-623) (for ISS samples) and the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB37053 (for Earth samples). All sequences were then combined and run together using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, bioinformatics pipeline to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data. A note that Earth samples from the original study were originally analyzed using the QIIME1, version 1.920,39, but re-analyzed using QIIME2 for this comparison. For both fungi and bacteria, primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt plug-in40 and paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method41. Sequences were then quality trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with a 3 low-quality base window using the Quality-filter plugin42. Fungal sequences were clustered using the VSEARCH open reference method with Unite database reference sequences (version 9.0)43,44, while bacterial sequences were quality checked using Dada245 and clustered by phylogeny. Beta Diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted unifrac statistics with a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis function in QIIME2. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated for all incubations and significance (P < 0.05) determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test statistic from QIIME2. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.046, the User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2022 database44, and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) version 1.447 was used to identify fungal taxonomy. Bacteria utilized the Greengenes database version 13_848 in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin43. Statistical analyses Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots using Bray–Curtis and UniFrac distance matrices were created in QIIME2 version 2021.8.0 then imported into R Studio (version 2021.09.0 Build 351) for visualization. The Adonis function was used to significance of beta diversity between Earth- and ISS-based dust samples and time elevated at each relative humidity condition. Alpha diversity significance was determined using a Kruskal–Wallis test, comparing by relative humidity condition and location. We also used Statistical Analysis System (SAS)® Studio, version 9.4, to compare absolute abundance of microbial species for time-of-wetness and original dust samples. Specifically, we used the PROC MULTTEST FDR Test Mean function in SAS. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used instead of Positive False Discovery Rate (PFDR) due to the relatively small sample size 49. Species that did not occur in at least 10% of all samples were removed before analysis 20,49,50. All relative abundance data was transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function and combined with qPCR quantities to produce an absolute abundance value as previously described 20.",
    "results": "Results Fungal communities in original dust samples We compared fungal communities in dust from the ISS and Earth-based residential homes. These samples are referred to as “original dust” and are the dust collected from vacuum bags from both locations that were not exposed to any elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) conditions in the laboratory prior to analysis. In total we had 15 original dust samples from Earth (1 sample each from 15 separate homes) and 4 original dust samples from the ISS (which included 3 triplicates from a total of four separate ISS vacuum bags). The most abundant fungal genera from these locations were different. Epicoccum, Alternaria, Pseudopithomyces, and Cladosporium were the dominant fungal genera on Earth while Aspergillus, Cyberlindnera, Rhodotorula, and Candida were more abundant on the ISS (Fig. 1a). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Fungal comparisons of original dust (no incubations or ERH exposure) from Earth-based residential homes and the International Space Station.

For all plots there was a total of 15 Earth-based original dust samples (1 for 15 residential homes) and 4 ISS dust bag samples (that included triplicates for each bag). ***Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test significance of P < 0.0001.Diversity metrics were analyzed using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for fungi and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) for bacteria due to the differences in bioinformatic pipelines used in this study. For original dust, fungal beta diversity significantly separated out by Earth and ISS samples (R2 = 0.23, P = 0.001, Table S1) (Fig. 1b). In general, the Earth samples were much more diverse compared to ISS samples. Earth original dust samples had a mean fungal OTU count of 465, while the ISS dust had a mean of only 102 OTUs (Table S2). Alpha diversity also showed significant differences in Richness and Shannon diversity metrics when comparing original dust samples between these locations (Richness H = 18.44, P < 0.0001; Shannon H = 17.20, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1c,d). We also performed a differential absolute abundance analysis on original dust samples showing there were a total of 791 fungal species identified with 119 more abundant in Earth-based dust from a wide variety of genera and 24 species more abundant in ISS samples (primarily from the Aspergillus, Malassezia, and Penicillium genera) (Table S3). Fungal growth in dust is also different under elevated moisture conditions We compared growth in fungal communities under varying elevated moisture conditions between Earth and the ISS. For each study, the same incubation procedure was followed in which dust (for ISS), or dust/carpet (for Earth) were incubated at 50% ERH and then exposed to 85% or 100% ERH for 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h per day. In this study, we compared incubated samples for each varying ERH condition (85% and 100% ERH) by combining all time points (Days 5, 10, and 14) and averaging by location (4 Earth-based homes and 4 ISS vacuum bags) as well as original dust samples. Fungal relative abundance for all ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) were similar to original dust samples with Epicoccum dominating for Earth samples and Aspergillus in ISS samples. However, when comparing all varying ERH samples, Aspergillus outcompetes all other fungal genera in ISS samples, where the communities in Earth samples remain relatively stable (Fig. 2a). Fungal communities of all combined varying ERH samples also varied based on location (R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001) especially at lower ERH conditions and shorter times elevated, with communities from different locations becoming more similar as ERH/time elevated increased (Fig. 2b). Additional breakdowns for fungal beta diversity at specific ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) and times elevated (6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h) all showed fungal community composition differences between Earth and ISS samples (Fig. S1, Table S1). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Fungal comparisons of varying equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) samples from Earth-based residential homes and the International Space Station. For both plots Earth and ISS samples represent the average of species measured in days 5, 10, and 14 combined for each relative humidity condition. (a) Relative abundance of fungal genera comparison of these locations with “Other” being any fungal genera that was below 5% relative abundance cumulatively. (b) Fungal beta diversity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilar matrix show a compelling difference between Earth-based and ISS samples. Ellipses represent the 95% confidence interval. For both plots there was a total of 108 Earth-based original dust samples and 107 ISS samples.Fungal alpha diversity was also significantly different between Earth and ISS varying ERH samples at 85% and 100% ERH for all times elevated (Kruskal–Wallis P < 0.001 for all conditions) (Fig. 3, Table S4). Earth-based samples were more diverse than ISS dust for all conditions and both locations generally became less diverse as ERH and time elevated increased. For all time points at varying elevated conditions (85% ERH), on Earth there was an average of 462 OTUs while on the ISS there were an average of 95 OTUs (Table S2). This was also true for all times elevated above saturated conditions (100% ERH), as on Earth there was an average of 356 fungal OTUs while on the ISS there were 56 (Table S2). A more detailed breakdown of fungal alpha diversity at each time elevated can be found in Figures S2-S5 and Table S2,S4. We also compared differential absolute abundance for varying ERH samples at 100% ERH and all times elevated (6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h). For these conditions, a total of 521 fungal species were identified with 456 more abundant in Earth-based house dust and 26 of them being more abundant in ISS dust (Table S5). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots of time-of-wetness samples for Earth-based residential homes (red) and from the International Space Station (blue). For both plots Earth and ISS samples represent the average of species measured in days 5, 10, and 14 for each relative humidity condition. Comparisons show Shannon diversity and Richness metrics for both (a) 85% and (b) 100% ERH conditions and the time fraction per day elevated on x-axis. ** Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test between Earth and ISS samples for all times. Bacterial community composition also different between earth and ISS samples We compared bacterial diversity in a smaller subset of samples that included original dust from 4 Earth-based residential homes and 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. Bacterial beta diversity for original dust samples visually separated by location, but due to low sample size statistical significance was not able to be determined (Fig. S6). Bacterial diversity in original dust samples was significantly different between Earth and ISS for Richness metrics (H = 5.33, P = 0.021), but not for Shannon diversity metrics (H = 3.00, P = 0.083) (Fig. S7, Table S6). Bacterial diversity was much higher on Earth with 237 bacterial ASVs compared to 102 on the ISS (Table S2). In varying ERH samples, bacterial comparisons we were made using original dust as well as day 14 samples at 50%, 85%, and 100% for 24-h time elevated which included 20 samples from both locations. Bacterial beta diversity for these samples was significantly different between Earth and the ISS for both weighted (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.004) and unweighted (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) unifrac distance matrices (Fig. 4a, Table S7). Figure 4. Open in a new tab (a) Bacterial beta diversity with Bray Curtis dissimilarity principal coordinate analyses plots for original time of wetness samples (TOW).

Ellipses represent 95% confidence interval for each set of data. (b) Bacterial Richness and Shannon diversity plots for time of wetness samples comparing Earth-based house dust to dust collected from the ISS. A total of 4 Earth-based house sites were compared to 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. Only original dust samples and day 14, 24-h time-of-wetness conditions were sequenced for bacteria at 50%, 85%, and 100% RH conditions for both plots. * Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test significance of P < 0.05 while ** is P < 0.001.Bacterial alpha diversity was also significantly different for time-of-wetness samples between these locations for both Richness (Richness H = 11.38, P = 0.0001) and Shannon diversity (H = 9.79, P = 0.0018) (Fig. 4b, Table S6). Again, for these samples Earth samples were more diverse with 104 bacterial ASVs while only 53 in ISS dust (Table S2). A limited bacterial differential abundance analysis was performed on original dust samples only. Of these samples a total of 81 bacterial species were identified of which 3 species were more abundant in ISS dust (Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Rothia dentocariosa) and 11 species more abundant in Earth-based dust (Table S8). We also performed a bacterial family level analysis for original dust samples and day 14 time-of-wetness samples. Relative abundance analyses show that for all conditions Earth-based dust and ISS dust contain different bacterial communities (Fig. 5). It also shows that while the communities are different between the two locations, the communities in both remain stable up until the 100% ERH condition is reached, at which point, clear differences can be seen. For Earth-based communities Moraxellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Micrococcaceae were the most abundant families in original dust, at 50% ERH, and at 85% ERH, with Staphylococcaceae and Bacillaceae becoming most abundant at 100% ERH. For ISS samples Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Streptoccoceae, and Pseudomonadaceae are most abundant bacterial families up until 100% ERH, when Corynebacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae significantly increasing as well as Paenibacillaceae becoming a major portion of the community. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Bacterial family level relative abundance plots comparing Earth- and space-based communities. Original dust samples were the average of 4 Earth-based samples from 4 separate homes and dust from 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH samples were from day 14 only and were also the average of 4 Earth-based homes and 4 ISS vacuum bags.",
    "discussion": "Discussion There are clear differences in bacterial and fungal communities in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes and from the ISS. This includes original dust immediately removed from a vacuum bag as well as after this dust is exposed to varying elevated moisture conditions to encourage rapid microbial growth. In general, these difference were more pronounced in fungi, especially under elevated moisture conditions, presumably because fungi are more sensitive to changing moisture conditions when compared to bacteria10,11,20. Interestingly, fungal communities in ISS dust changed much more rapidly compared to Earth house dust with varying moisture conditions mainly due to Aspergillus dominating in the ISS dust. These differences may be attributed to the unique stressors faced by microbes during spaceflight conditions such as microgravity21, low-dose radiation22, and elevated CO2 concentrations23 which allows them to rapidly grow when ideal conditions are introduced. In Earth-based house dust the presence of Epicocum sp. was the major difference in fungal genera when comparing to ISS dust. This is most likely due to Epicocum sp. mostly being associated with soils, fruits, and grains24, which are not found in the ISS environment. The microbes in these locations likely differ due to different environmental contributions. For example, on Earth the number of human occupants25, presence of pets26, types of building materials, types of ventilation system27, and contribution of the outdoor environment28 can all have a profound impact on the microbes present. This study shows that Earth-based indoor environments are much more diverse compared to the ISS, which has fewer occupants, no pets (although mouse experiments are often onboard), no outdoor contributions, and different types of materials and ventilation. In addition, behaviors such as cleaning habits also contribute to microbial presence and, on the ISS, cleaning is done weekly with different types of cleaners, none of which are aerosol disinfectants. Earth-based homes can vacuum, use aerosols, carpet powders, and many other products, though we do not know the cleaning habits used in these specific samples and if it could contribute to the differences in the microbial communities. This study is subject to several limitations, which mainly relate to the location of incubations, as ISS dust was incubated on Earth and not in space. Future research might evaluate how these changes may differ when incubations occur under microgravity, higher radiation levels, and other conditions unique to space travel. In addition, Earth dust samples were also incubated embedded in carpet and vacuumed again before molecular analysis, while ISS samples were not, which could alter the overall results. The different studies had a difference in starting dust mass of 25 mg for ISS and 50 mg for Earth samples and the ISS dust was not sieved, although we do not anticipate that this had a measurable impact on the findings. In addition, not sieving the ISS dust is potentially more representative of dust exposure in the ISS built environment due to lack of gravitational forces settling larger particles. Furthermore, we had limited information of ISS dust sampling, including locations onboard, how long between cleaning events, or if the vacuum was used to clean other areas of the spacecraft. This study utilized a DNA-based analysis that could not determine viability of organisms and is also subject to standard limitations of qPCR and DNA sequencing analysis of microbes29,30. Overall, the microbiome of dust from Earth is more diverse than that of the ISS. These community differences result in changes in microbial growth upon exposure to moisture that may be associated with health impacts. With the ISS being decommissioned in 2030, there will be newly designed commercial space stations taking its place. In addition, there will be more people than ever living and working in space, including the general public with space tourism. This study shows that there are clear differences in a highly regulated government owned and operated spacecraft and these changes can become increasingly important as new station designs, with larger, more varied crews, and commercial objectives launch into low-Earth orbit. This understanding can help us to maintain a healthy indoor microbiome on spacecraft during both increased activity in low-Earth orbit and long duration human-occupied space travel, to promote crew health17, spacecraft integrity31, and planetary protection32.",

Copyright notice ID: 11126634 PMID: 38789478 Abstract Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection. Subject terms: Environmental microbiology, FungiIntroduction In the upcoming decades, human activity in space will rapidly expand both in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond to an estimated $1.4 trillion dollar industry1. NASA’s Artemis missions, which will send humans back to the moon, includes a lunar orbiting space station (The Lunar Gateway) as well as a lunar surface habitat, and will all be a stepping stone to sending humans to Mars2. In addition, private companies, such as Starlab Space, LLC and Blue Origin, are building commercially owned and operated space stations with support from NASA’s commercial LEO destination initiative3. The rapid increase in the number of people living and working in space will require careful spacecraft design to support human health and wellbeing. One critical aspect of this design is to understand the microorganisms within a spacecraft. The International Space Station (ISS) has been a continuously inhabited confined environment in LEO since November 2000, and over 12,000 microbial species have been identified onboard4. The ISS is a closed system and the microbes primarily originate from the astronauts onboard5, as all humans have a distinct associated microbial ecosystem6. Other potential microbial sources on the ISS include plant experiments being grown onboard7, as well as those from the original construction materials. The ISS has its own unique microbiome, as does every human-occupied indoor environment on Earth. Similar to Earth-based indoor environments8, many of these microbes can reside in the dust generated onboard the ISS9. This is due to the high nutrient content in dust that microbes can utilize, with moisture being the limiting factor for growth10,11. Bacterial communities from ISS dust and other Earth-based confined environments such as clean rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units each contain a similar core microbial community12, although there are some significant differences between environment types13. Whether in space or on Earth, it is critical to maintain microbial communities indoors that support human health14. For instance, health effects on Earth are associated with microbial growth15, and thus it is critical to prevent this growth by controlling indoor moisture. Although, NASA standards for nominal relative humidity conditions on the ISS is between 25 and 75%16, there are pockets of elevated moisture present due to astronaut hygiene, exercising, in food areas, and in plant habitats. This study also provides insight into how microbial communities will react to unintended conditions such as a ventilation system failure or fire suppression event. There have also been reported issues reported on the ISS due to unintended microbial growth such as crewmember infections17 and destruction of plants onboard18. However, we need an improved understanding of how the microbial communities on the ISS compare to typical occupied spaces on Earth, and how these communities change under unexpected adverse conditions such as excess moisture. The goal of this study is to determine similarities and differences between microbial communities and growth under elevated moisture conditions in occupied spaces on Earth and the ISS. Here, we leverage raw sequencing data from two previous studies with nearly identical methods that have performed microbial analyses on dust collected from the ISS19 and from Earth-based residential homes20. These studies have a special focus on indoor fungi and characterize what happens when ideal growth conditions occur such as the introduction of elevated moisture conditions. This is a unique one-to-one comparison as methods were performed in the same laboratory, therefore all incubation, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics protocols are almost identical. Key differences between the studies were the presence of dust in carpet for Earth-based samples and different starting dust mass concentrations (50 mg for Earth-dust and 25 mg for ISS dust). The ISS is a complex environment that serves as an astronaut home, workplace, and transportation environment. While it can’t be distinctly classified as only one of these, we chose the residential home comparison because people on Earth spend most of their time in their home and to emphasize that astronauts are spending all their time in the spacecraft, including during sleep. This comparison of Earth- and space-based microbiomes in continuously occupied indoor environments will help us gain a better understanding of how the unique conditions experienced during spaceflight may alter microbial communities. As humanity becomes more active in space, the need to define what a healthy microbiome is in human occupied spacecraft will grow ever more important. These results can inform both Earth-based and future space-based indoor spaces on how microbial communities may change to identify any potential problems that may arise when unintended microbial growth occurs in these environments.Results Fungal communities in original dust samples We compared fungal communities in dust from the ISS and Earth-based residential homes. These samples are referred to as “original dust” and are the dust collected from vacuum bags from both locations that were not exposed to any elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) conditions in the laboratory prior to analysis. In total we had 15 original dust samples from Earth (1 sample each from 15 separate homes) and 4 original dust samples from the ISS (which included 3 triplicates from a total of four separate ISS vacuum bags). The most abundant fungal genera from these locations were different. Epicoccum, Alternaria, Pseudopithomyces, and Cladosporium were the dominant fungal genera on Earth while Aspergillus, Cyberlindnera, Rhodotorula, and Candida were more abundant on the ISS (Fig. 1a).

For all plots there was a total of 15 Earth-based original dust samples (1 for 15 residential homes) and 4 ISS dust bag samples (that included triplicates for each bag). ***Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test significance of P < 0.0001.Diversity metrics were analyzed using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for fungi and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) for bacteria due to the differences in bioinformatic pipelines used in this study. For original dust, fungal beta diversity significantly separated out by Earth and ISS samples (R2 = 0.23, P = 0.001, Table S1) (Fig. 1b). In general, the Earth samples were much more diverse compared to ISS samples. Earth original dust samples had a mean fungal OTU count of 465, while the ISS dust had a mean of only 102 OTUs (Table S2). Alpha diversity also showed significant differences in Richness and Shannon diversity metrics when comparing original dust samples between these locations (Richness H = 18.44, P < 0.0001; Shannon H = 17.20, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1c,d). We also performed a differential absolute abundance analysis on original dust samples showing there were a total of 791 fungal species identified with 119 more abundant in Earth-based dust from a wide variety of genera and 24 species more abundant in ISS samples (primarily from the Aspergillus, Malassezia, and Penicillium genera) (Table S3).Fungal growth in dust is also different under elevated moisture conditions We compared growth in fungal communities under varying elevated moisture conditions between Earth and the ISS. For each study, the same incubation procedure was followed in which dust (for ISS), or dust/carpet (for Earth) were incubated at 50% ERH and then exposed to 85% or 100% ERH for 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h per day. In this study, we compared incubated samples for each varying ERH condition (85% and 100% ERH) by combining all time points (Days 5, 10, and 14) and averaging by location (4 Earth-based homes and 4 ISS vacuum bags) as well as original dust samples. Fungal relative abundance for all ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) were similar to original dust samples with Epicoccum dominating for Earth samples and Aspergillus in ISS samples. However, when comparing all varying ERH samples, Aspergillus outcompetes all other fungal genera in ISS samples, where the communities in Earth samples remain relatively stable (Fig. 2a). Fungal communities of all combined varying ERH samples also varied based on location (R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001) especially at lower ERH conditions and shorter times elevated, with communities from different locations becoming more similar as ERH/time elevated increased (Fig. 2b). Additional breakdowns for fungal beta diversity at specific ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) and times elevated (6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h) all showed fungal community composition differences between Earth and ISS samples (Fig. S1, Table S1). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Fungal comparisons of varying equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) samples from Earth-based residential homes and the International Space Station. For both plots Earth and ISS samples represent the average of species measured in days 5, 10, and 14 combined for each relative humidity condition. (a) Relative abundance of fungal genera comparison of these locations with “Other” being any fungal genera that was below 5% relative abundance cumulatively. (b) Fungal beta diversity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilar matrix show a compelling difference between Earth-based and ISS samples. Ellipses represent the 95% confidence interval. For both plots there was a total of 108 Earth-based original dust samples and 107 ISS samples.Fungal alpha diversity was also significantly different between Earth and ISS varying ERH samples at 85% and 100% ERH for all times elevated (Kruskal–Wallis P < 0.001 for all conditions) (Fig. 3, Table S4). Earth-based samples were more diverse than ISS dust for all conditions and both locations generally became less diverse as ERH and time elevated increased. For all time points at varying elevated conditions (85% ERH), on Earth there was an average of 462 OTUs while on the ISS there were an average of 95 OTUs (Table S2). This was also true for all times elevated above saturated conditions (100% ERH), as on Earth there was an average of 356 fungal OTUs while on the ISS there were 56 (Table S2). A more detailed breakdown of fungal alpha diversity at each time elevated can be found in Figures S2-S5 and Table S2,S4. We also compared differential absolute abundance for varying ERH samples at 100% ERH and all times elevated (6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h). For these conditions, a total of 521 fungal species were identified with 456 more abundant in Earth-based house dust and 26 of them being more abundant in ISS dust (Table S5). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots of time-of-wetness samples for Earth-based residential homes (red) and from the International Space Station (blue). For both plots Earth and ISS samples represent the average of species measured in days 5, 10, and 14 for each relative humidity condition. Comparisons show Shannon diversity and Richness metrics for both (a) 85% and (b) 100% ERH conditions and the time fraction per day elevated on x-axis. ** Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test between Earth and ISS samples for all times.Bacterial community composition also different between earth and ISS samples We compared bacterial diversity in a smaller subset of samples that included original dust from 4 Earth-based residential homes and 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. Bacterial beta diversity for original dust samples visually separated by location, but due to low sample size statistical significance was not able to be determined (Fig. S6). Bacterial diversity in original dust samples was significantly different between Earth and ISS for Richness metrics (H = 5.33, P = 0.021), but not for Shannon diversity metrics (H = 3.00, P = 0.083) (Fig. S7, Table S6). Bacterial diversity was much higher on Earth with 237 bacterial ASVs compared to 102 on the ISS (Table S2). In varying ERH samples, bacterial comparisons we were made using original dust as well as day 14 samples at 50%, 85%, and 100% for 24-h time elevated which included 20 samples from both locations. Bacterial beta diversity for these samples was significantly different between Earth and the ISS for both weighted (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.004) and unweighted (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) unifrac distance matrices (Fig. 4a, Table S7). Figure 4. Open in a new tab (a) Bacterial beta diversity with Bray Curtis dissimilarity principal coordinate analyses plots for original time of wetness samples (TOW). Location of dust samples are indicated by shape (Earth – circle, ISS – triangle) and TOW is indicated by color gradient (Green – Original Dust to Red – 100% relative humidity). Ellipses represent 95% confidence interval for each set of data. (b) Bacterial Richness and Shannon diversity plots for time of wetness samples comparing Earth-based house dust to dust collected from the ISS. A total of 4 Earth-based house sites were compared to 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. Only original dust samples and day 14, 24-h time-of-wetness conditions were sequenced for bacteria at 50%, 85%, and 100% RH conditions for both plots. * Indicates Kruskal–Wallis t-test significance of P < 0.05 while ** is P < 0.001.Bacterial alpha diversity was also significantly different for time-of-wetness samples between these locations for both Richness (Richness H = 11.38, P = 0.0001) and Shannon diversity (H = 9.79, P = 0.0018) (Fig. 4b, Table S6). Again, for these samples Earth samples were more diverse with 104 bacterial ASVs while only 53 in ISS dust (Table S2). A limited bacterial differential abundance analysis was performed on original dust samples only. Of these samples a total of 81 bacterial species were identified of which 3 species were more abundant in ISS dust (Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Rothia dentocariosa) and 11 species more abundant in Earth-based dust (Table S8). We also performed a bacterial family level analysis for original dust samples and day 14 time-of-wetness samples. Relative abundance analyses show that for all conditions Earth-based dust and ISS dust contain different bacterial communities (Fig. 5). It also shows that while the communities are different between the two locations, the communities in both remain stable up until the 100% ERH condition is reached, at which point, clear differences can be seen. For Earth-based communities Moraxellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Micrococcaceae were the most abundant families in original dust, at 50% ERH, and at 85% ERH, with Staphylococcaceae and Bacillaceae becoming most abundant at 100% ERH. For ISS samples Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Streptoccoceae, and Pseudomonadaceae are most abundant bacterial families up until 100% ERH, when Corynebacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae significantly increasing as well as Paenibacillaceae becoming a major portion of the community. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Bacterial family level relative abundance plots comparing Earth- and space-based communities. Original dust samples were the average of 4 Earth-based samples from 4 separate homes and dust from 4 separate ISS vacuum bags. 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH samples were from day 14 only and were also the average of 4 Earth-based homes and 4 ISS vacuum bags.Discussion There are clear differences in bacterial and fungal communities in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes and from the ISS. This includes original dust immediately removed from a vacuum bag as well as after this dust is exposed to varying elevated moisture conditions to encourage rapid microbial growth. In general, these difference were more pronounced in fungi, especially under elevated moisture conditions, presumably because fungi are more sensitive to changing moisture conditions when compared to bacteria10,11,20. Interestingly, fungal communities in ISS dust changed much more rapidly compared to Earth house dust with varying moisture conditions mainly due to Aspergillus dominating in the ISS dust. These differences may be attributed to the unique stressors faced by microbes during spaceflight conditions such as microgravity21, low-dose radiation22, and elevated CO2 concentrations23 which allows them to rapidly grow when ideal conditions are introduced. In Earth-based house dust the presence of Epicocum sp. was the major difference in fungal genera when comparing to ISS dust. This is most likely due to Epicocum sp. mostly being associated with soils, fruits, and grains24, which are not found in the ISS environment. The microbes in these locations likely differ due to different environmental contributions. For example, on Earth the number of human occupants25, presence of pets26, types of building materials, types of ventilation system27, and contribution of the outdoor environment28 can all have a profound impact on the microbes present. This study shows that Earth-based indoor environments are much more diverse compared to the ISS, which has fewer occupants, no pets (although mouse experiments are often onboard), no outdoor contributions, and different types of materials and ventilation. In addition, behaviors such as cleaning habits also contribute to microbial presence and, on the ISS, cleaning is done weekly with different types of cleaners, none of which are aerosol disinfectants. Earth-based homes can vacuum, use aerosols, carpet powders, and many other products, though we do not know the cleaning habits used in these specific samples and if it could contribute to the differences in the microbial communities. This study is subject to several limitations, which mainly relate to the location of incubations, as ISS dust was incubated on Earth and not in space. Future research might evaluate how these changes may differ when incubations occur under microgravity, higher radiation levels, and other conditions unique to space travel. In addition, Earth dust samples were also incubated embedded in carpet and vacuumed again before molecular analysis, while ISS samples were not, which could alter the overall results. The different studies had a difference in starting dust mass of 25 mg for ISS and 50 mg for Earth samples and the ISS dust was not sieved, although we do not anticipate that this had a measurable impact on the findings. In addition, not sieving the ISS dust is potentially more representative of dust exposure in the ISS built environment due to lack of gravitational forces settling larger particles. Furthermore, we had limited information of ISS dust sampling, including locations onboard, how long between cleaning events, or if the vacuum was used to clean other areas of the spacecraft. This study utilized a DNA-based analysis that could not determine viability of organisms and is also subject to standard limitations of qPCR and DNA sequencing analysis of microbes29,30. Overall, the microbiome of dust from Earth is more diverse than that of the ISS. These community differences result in changes in microbial growth upon exposure to moisture that may be associated with health impacts. With the ISS being decommissioned in 2030, there will be newly designed commercial space stations taking its place. In addition, there will be more people than ever living and working in space, including the general public with space tourism. This study shows that there are clear differences in a highly regulated government owned and operated spacecraft and these changes can become increasingly important as new station designs, with larger, more varied crews, and commercial objectives launch into low-Earth orbit. This understanding can help us to maintain a healthy indoor microbiome on spacecraft during both increased activity in low-Earth orbit and long duration human-occupied space travel, to promote crew health17, spacecraft integrity31, and planetary protection32.Methods Overview This study aims to understand the differences between the indoor microbiomes of Earth-based residential buildings and dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS). Specifically, ISS dust and residential carpet with dust previously collected from homes in Ohio were incubated under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework19,20. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from these incubated samples, sequenced with Illumina MiSeq, and analyzed with a bioinformatics pipeline to determine taxonomy.Dust samples All ISS dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypo-allergenic filter system Oreck# PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard which the astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. Briefly, ISS dust samples were triple sealed in plastic bags until they could be returned to Earth, where all experiments were conducted. A detailed breakdown of ISS dust sample collection dates can be found in our previous study19. Earth carpet and dust samples were collected in residential homes throughout Ohio, USA in a previous study20. Briefly, dust was collected from the homes vacuum bags and carpet was removed directly from the same homes. The dust was embedded into carpet collected from the same home using ASTM method F609-13 after which incubations were then performed. After incubations, the dust was vacuumed from the carpet using Eureka Mighty Mite with adapter for a 19 mm × 90 mm Whatman cellulose thimble. The previous study had sampled 19 residential homes and for comparison to ISS dust, 4 of these homes were randomly selected to correspond to the 4 total ISS vacuum bags collected.Incubations For both studies, incubations occurred in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25°C covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape. Salt solutions were made to simulate 50% and 85% ERH conditions, while Deionized (DI) water was used for 100% ERH conditions19,20. Onset® HOBO® Data loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA USA) to monitor ERH and temperature conditions inside the incubation chamber. ISS Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish19. In comparison, Earth dust samples were sieved to 300 μm and embedded in 10 cm × 10 cm carpet squares for incubation. We do not anticipate any significant impact with the carpet and ISS dust as they are very similar in structure due the linty, fibrous nature of the ISS dust. Earth and ISS samples were exposed to varying elevated ERH conditions using the time-of-wetness framework previously outlined20, which refers to the time fraction per day that relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold33. Briefly, samples were incubated between 50% ERH and elevated (85% ERH)/saturated (100% ERH) conditions for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day. ISS Samples were extracted and quantified at day 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25 mg dust sample per day per bag)19, while Earth samples were analyzed at day 0, 5, 10, and 14 after vacuuming approximately 50 mg of dust from carpet squares20.DNA extraction and sequencing DNA was extracted from dust samples for both studies using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture34 (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads). Each DNA extraction run included a blank and was confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at -20℃ until use. Sequencing for all samples was performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ at RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). For fungal sequencing ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) ribosomal DNA primers35, while bacteria used 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5’-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) primers with 2 × 300 bp sequencing reads. Differential abundance analyses used total fungal and bacterial quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) values measure at the kingdom level as previously described11,20. To quantify fungal concentration, we targeted the 18S rRNA gene with forward primer (FF2) 5′-GGTTCTATTTTGTTGGT TTCTA-3′, and reverse primer (FR1) 5′-CTCTCAATCTGTCAATCCTTATT-3′36. For bacteria we targeted the 16S rRNA gene with forward primer 5’-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3’, reverse prime 5’-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3’, and PROBE (6-FAM)-5’CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3’-(BHQ)36–38. For the purposes of this study, we compared a randomly selected 4 out of 19 sites from the Earth-based study to the 4 ISS bags for varying ERH comparison and included samples from the original dust as well as at day 5, 10, and 14 for all ERH conditions. For original dust samples, all available samples were used which included a total of 15 samples (one per home as available) from the Earth-based study compared to 4 total ISS samples (with three replicates per ISS vacuum bag).Bioinformatics The raw sequencing files were extracted from both previous studies at NASA’s GeneLab database (OSD-694, GLDS-623) (for ISS samples) and the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB37053 (for Earth samples). All sequences were then combined and run together using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, bioinformatics pipeline to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data. A note that Earth samples from the original study were originally analyzed using the QIIME1, version 1.920,39, but re-analyzed using QIIME2 for this comparison. For both fungi and bacteria, primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt plug-in40 and paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method41. Sequences were then quality trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with a 3 low-quality base window using the Quality-filter plugin42. Fungal sequences were clustered using the VSEARCH open reference method with Unite database reference sequences (version 9.0)43,44, while bacterial sequences were quality checked using Dada245 and clustered by phylogeny. Beta Diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted unifrac statistics with a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis function in QIIME2. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated for all incubations and significance (P < 0.05) determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test statistic from QIIME2. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.046, the User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2022 database44, and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) version 1.447 was used to identify fungal taxonomy. Bacteria utilized the Greengenes database version 13_848 in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin43.Statistical analyses Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots using Bray–Curtis and UniFrac distance matrices were created in QIIME2 version 2021.8.0 then imported into R Studio (version 2021.09.0 Build 351) for visualization. The Adonis function was used to significance of beta diversity between Earth- and ISS-based dust samples and time elevated at each relative humidity condition. Alpha diversity significance was determined using a Kruskal–Wallis test, comparing by relative humidity condition and location. We also used Statistical Analysis System (SAS)® Studio, version 9.4, to compare absolute abundance of microbial species for time-of-wetness and original dust samples. Specifically, we used the PROC MULTTEST FDR Test Mean function in SAS. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used instead of Positive False Discovery Rate (PFDR) due to the relatively small sample size 49. Species that did not occur in at least 10% of all samples were removed before analysis 20,49,50. All relative abundance data was transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function and combined with qPCR quantities to produce an absolute abundance value as previously described 20.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

    "results": "Results Increased relative humidity conditions lead to increased microbial growth Dust was received from four vacuum bags from the ISS with an average initial fungal concentration of 4.39 × 106 spore equivalents (SE)/mg dust and an average bacterial load of 1.06 × 107 cells/mg dust. After incubating the dust samples for 2 weeks at different ERH conditions to simulate an unexpected high moisture event, the fungal concentration ranged from 4.22 × 106 SE/mg dust at 50% ERH to 2.10 × 1010 SE/mg dust at 100% ERH (Fig. 1, Table S2). Increased fungal concentration was associated with elevated ERH conditions after 2 weeks (Spearman rank correlation (rs) = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with significantly more fungal growth at 80% (P < 0.044) and 85–100% ERH (P < 0.0001) (Table S3). Bacterial concentration was significantly increased compared to the original load at 90% (P = 0.005) and 100% ERH (P = 0.0001) with a positive association between bacterial concentration and ERH (rs = 0.39, P = 0.0001) (Additional file 2: Figure S1A, Table S2–S3). Dust was also collected by tweezers from the ISS HEPA filters and returned frozen for analysis with lower fungal and bacterial loads compared to bulk dust samples (Additional file 1: Table S4). These results are similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [8, 24] and bacteria [8] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [24] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109 spore equivalents per milligram of dust when exposed to 100% ERH for 2 weeks. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Fungal growth concentrations of original dust and after constant equilibrium relative humidity incubations at 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 100% ERH at 25℃. Each fungal concentration represents the average value of four vacuum bags which included physical triplicates for each bag and triplicate qPCR concentrations for each sample for a total of 36 measurements per condition. Error bars represent the standard error of fungal quantities for each vacuum bag. * indicate statistically significant growth (P < 0.05) compared to the original dust using Satterthwaite two-sample t testOriginal dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) and dust incubated at 50% ERH for 2 weeks showed no visible signs of microbial growth, in scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 2A,B). At elevated relative humidity conditions of 85% and 100% ERH, we observed indications of active fungal growth on the dust substrate (Fig. 2C,D). This included elongated hyphae with conidia production prevalent on almost all dust surfaces, which indicates that fungal reproduction is occurring. In general, more of all of these structures were observed at 100% compared to 85% ERH, similar to other studies with Earth dust and carpet samples [24]. Our previous microscopy analyses in residential carpets also concluded that almost no fungal growth occurred even at high ERH conditions if house dust was not present, indicating the nutrients in dust are essential for active growth [24]. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ISS dust from the original dust (A) and incubations at 50% ERH (B) show fibrous dust materials, but no fungal growth. Fungal growth including spores, elongated hyphae, and different fungal propagules was observed in ISS dust incubated at 85% ERH (C) and 100% ERH (D) for 2 weeks at 25℃Total soluble organic carbon was measured in ISS dust samples that included the original dust as well as dust incubated at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks at 25℃ (Fig. 3). For each condition, a total of four samples were measured that included one sample per ISS bag collected. In the original dust, total soluble organic carbon ranged from 12.55 to 36.79 mg/L with no significant changes after a 2-week incubation at 85% ERH (10.2–29.05 mg/L, P = 0.52). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in soluble organic carbon after 2-week incubations at 100% ERH (1.76–8.08 mg/L, P= 0.048). This is a soluble organic carbon utilization rate of approximately 1.2 and 0.3 mg soluble carbon per day for 100% and 85% ERH conditions, respectively. From the original ISS dust samples, we measured an average of 22 mg soluble organic carbon per milligram of dust. In comparison, house dust from Earth-based residential homes contains 35 mg of total soluble organic carbon per mg of dust [8]. This indicates that dust from both the ISS and homes on Earth contains significantly more carbon than is required for fungal growth (~ 0.0072 mg soluble carbon/mg dust). Therefore, moisture continues to be the limiting factor for growth. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Total soluble organic carbon (TOC) measured in ISS dust in the original dust as well as in dust incubated (25°C) for 2 weeks at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions. Significant reductions in TOC were observed for 100% conditions but not 85% compared to original dust samples indicating potential fungal use of TOC in ISS dust. Each condition contained four samples (one from each ISS bag in this study), and error bars are the standard deviation of these four bags. * represents a statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in total soluble organic carbon compared to original dust samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t test Fungal growth predictions vary based on maximum ERH Relative humidity often fluctuates in indoor spaces, so we applied the time-of-wetness framework to model fungal growth measured under varying ERH conditions (high moisture for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day). We observed an activation-limited growth model for elevated (85% ERH) conditions, while at saturated (100% ERH), we observed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). At both elevated and saturated conditions, growth was associated with increasing time per day at higher moisture levels (rs = 0.68, P = 0.015). Bacterial growth showed no significant difference between elevated and saturated conditions and did not align with any time-of-wetness growth model (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). On Earth, fungi in house dust samples differed and showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for both elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions, and bacteria also had insufficient growth to apply a model [25]. Effective growth constants and total fungal growth rates for the model are available in Additional file 1: Tables S5–S9. The differences in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS-built environments may be due to different microbial and chemical compositions of the dust because even Earth-based buildings in close proximity can differ. These differences can be attributed to many environmental factors such as the occupants inside, cleaning habits, building materials, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Fungal time-of-wetness modeling for elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Elevated conditions (orange) show an activation-limited growth model, while saturated conditions (green) show a deactivation-limited growth model. Error bars shown represent the standard error between all four ISS bags sampled Microbial diversity changes as ERH conditions are altered We analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in the samples via DNA amplicon sequencing (Table S10). There was a total of 11,180,519 quality fungal reads and 2,502,228 quality bacterial reads present in all sequenced samples. A total of 107 fungal species and 127 bacterial species were present in at least 10% of samples. The most common fungal genera were Aspergillus (100% of samples), Penicilium (95%), and Rhodotorula (94%). The most common fungal species in all samples included Aspergillus sydowii (100%), Aspergillus unguis (100%), and Penicillium chrysogenum (90%). For bacteria, Bacillales (99%), Actinomycetales (99%), and Clostridiales (96%) were the most common order and the most common bacterial species were Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (81%), Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (78%), and Lactobacillus helveticus (74%). After incubation at constant ERH, fungal community composition differed by each bag (R2 = 0.233, P = 0.001) and ERH condition (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5A). In all varying ERH samples, fungal community composition also differed by bag (R2 = 0.098, P = 0.001) and varying ERH conditions (R2 = 0.090, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5B), though to a lesser degree compared to the constant ERH incubation. These differences were more pronounced when limiting the analysis to a single maximum ERH level or time elevated. For example, considering the 24-h incubations only for elevated and saturated conditions shows a more distinct difference in species (R2 = 0.201, P = 0.001). PCoA plots for all conditions is shown in Additional file 2: Figures S2–S4 and Additional file 1: Table S11). Bacterial beta diversity analyses showed similar trends of community composition changing with increased ERH and time-of-wetness conditions (Additional file 2: Figure S5, Additional file 1: Table S12). Finally, frozen dust samples were compared to the original dust and constant ERH incubation samples at 50, 85, and 100% ERH. For both fungi and bacteria, frozen samples clustered close to the original dust and 50% ERH samples but were more dissimilar to 85 and 100% ERH samples (Additional file 1: Figure S6, Additional file 1: Table S13). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) of beta diversity fungal species present in ISS dust after 2-week incubations at varying ERH conditions (A) and time-of-wetness conditions (B). Both scenarios show as ERH increases (green to red) the fungal species composition is alteredMoisture also impacted sample diversity. For fungal constant ERH incubations, richness was significantly decreased (Q < 0.05) compared to original dust samples starting at 85% ERH, while Shannon diversity differences appeared at 80% ERH (Fig. 6A, B, Additional file 1: Table S14). For time-of-wetness samples at saturated (100% ERH) conditions, there were significant changes in both fungal richness and Shannon diversity at extended times elevated (12, 18, and 24 h) compared to the shorter times tested (0 and 6 h) (Fig. 6C,D). We also limited analyses to specific ERH conditions and times elevated (Additional file 1: Table S15). Bacterial samples also showed significant changes in richness and Shannon diversity during constant ERH incubations at 85%, 90%, and 100% ERH compared to original dust samples, while time-of-wetness samples also showed significant differences between 50 and 100% ERH conditions for 24 h (Additional file 1: Figure S7A, Additional file 1: Table S16). Finally, frozen samples were compared to original dust samples as well as samples from constant ERH incubations at 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH. For bacteria, there was a significant difference in both richness and Shannon diversity for all conditions tested; however, fungi only showed these differences at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks compared to the frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S7B, Additional file 1: Table S17). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots for constant ERH, 2-week incubations (A, B), and time of wetness incubations (C, D). For constant incubations, the x-axis represents the original dust and ERH conditions after 2 weeks of incubation (A, B). Time-of-wetness incubations show the time elevated on the x-axis as well as the ERH conditions tested (50% = red, 85% = green, and 100% = blue). Note that 50% of ERH conditions for time-of-wetness samples were only performed at a time elevated of one (24 h per day)Differential abundance analyses were used to compare fungal species between all incubation conditions in this study. Comparing fungal species at non-elevated (original dust, 50, 60, 70% ERH) to elevated (80, 85, 90, 100% ERH) conditions identified a total of 77 species more abundant at non-elevated conditions compared to only six species more abundant at elevated conditions (Additional file 1: Table S18). This indicates that at elevated ERH conditions (> 80% ERH) fungi such as Aspergillus sydowii (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus unguis (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus nidulans (P < 0.0001), Aspergiullus subversicolor (P < 0.0001), Penicillium chrysogenum (P = 0.0016), and Aspegillus hongkongensis (P = 0.0071) may be growing, significantly reducing fungal diversity in the ISS dust. Under varying relative humidity conditions, there were generally more species associated with lower moisture conditions (Additional file 1: Tables S19–S21). These analyses were also performed for bacteria and found no significant differences in bacterial species between any of the incubation times and ERH conditions tested (Additional file 1: Table S23). Aspergillus is the dominant genus, and it becomes more dominant as ERH and time elevated increases (Fig. 7). A similar trend is also shown in the constant ERH incubations (Additional file 1: Figure S8), where Aspergillus is the most dominant at 85% and 90% ERH. Interestingly, at 100%, Penicillium starts to grow significantly more compared to other elevated ERH conditions (80%, 85%, and 90% ERH). Finally, we compared original dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) to frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S9). For relative abundance, the original dust samples contained more Aspergillus, Cyberlinda, and Alternaria, while the frozen samples appeared to contain more Rhodotorula, Malassezia, and Rhodosporidiobolus. There was also a significant difference in absolute abundance for all fungal genera with up to 104 spore eq/mg dust present in the original dust samples compared to the frozen samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Mean relative (A) and absolute (B) abundance data for the fungal genus of time-of-wetness samples. Abundances represent elevated (85%) and saturated (100%) relative humidity conditions at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h time-of-wetness samples as well as unmodified (50%) at 24 h. The mean abundances here represent the average for day 5, 10, 14, and 21 dust samples for each relative humidity and time-of-wetness condition for the four total ISS vacuum bags tested in this study (a total of 12 samples for each ERH/time-of-wetness condition)",
    "discussion": "Discussion To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [28]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5 h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [58] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [59, 60]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. In ISS dust after 2 weeks exposed to constant ERH conditions significant growth for fungi occurred at 80% RH, while for bacteria this occurred at 90% ERH compared to original dust samples (no ERH exposure). This is similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [5, 8] and bacteria [5] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [8] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109SE per milligram dust when exposed to 100% RH for 2 weeks. The time-of-wetness framework has also been applied to growth in Earth-based house dust samples that can be compared to samples from ISS dust. Time-of-wetness samples showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for fungi for both elevated (85% RH) and saturated (100% RH) conditions [9]. These results differ in contrast to the ISS dust where elevated RH fungi showed an activation-limited growth model and at saturated conditions showed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). There may be several potential reasons for this difference in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS built environments. Generally, every indoor environment has a different microbial dust composition. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. These results offer a path to improved prediction of fungal growth in specialized indoor spaces modeled on fluctuating ERH conditions. However, it is important to restate that these incubations were performed on Earth and not in environmental conditions experienced in low-Earth orbit such as microgravity, elevated CO2, and low-dose radiation, all of which may affect microbial growth and microbial composition. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered. Given the difficulty of procuring spaceflight samples, we have a relatively small sample size (dust from four ISS vacuum bags), but this should be sufficient to provide valuable information. These limitations highlight the need for future on-orbit studies to better understand this microbiology during actual spaceflight conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].",

Copyright notice ID: 11386075 PMID: 39256883 Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

This will be fueled in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination initiative that will support private companies such as Starlab Space, LLC, and Blue Origin to build and operate the next generation of space stations [1]. In addition, NASA’s Artemis missions will establish a lunar orbiting space station named Gateway, as well as a surface habitat, which will be the proving ground for technologies needed to live on Mars [2]. One of the best analogs we have available to these future systems is the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a unique built environment that is an almost completely closed indoor system continuously inhabited for over 20 years in low-Earth orbit. The ISS contains its own unique microbiome with over 12,000 species identified onboard [3], similar to indoor environments on Earth [4]. These microbes originate from the astronauts, their food, onboard experiments, and other sources [5, 6]. Similar to Earth, many microbes reside in the dust [7]. On Earth, indoor dust acts as a sink [8] for microbes and a potential exposure source [9] for occupants in the indoor environment. Dust is also generated onboard the ISS from the daily activities of the crew. The crew must use a vacuum to remove dust from the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter coverings, which are a part of the air ventilation system, on a weekly basis [10]. The exposure risk for microbes in dust is not well understood in microgravity environments, but it differs from Earth due to the altered particle size distributions in the air and the absence of gravitational settling influences how they deposit in the lungs when inhaled [11–13]. Exposure to fungal growth indoors is associated with negative health outcomes such as asthma and allergies [14, 15]. Understanding indoor microbial exposure risks is especially critical in the extreme conditions experienced during spaceflight that compromise the human immune system, potentially exacerbating any negative health effects [16]. Additionally, the unique stressors of a spaceflight environment can cause changes in microbial communities such as increased virulence [17] and antimicrobial resistance [5]. Negative health impacts due to microbial exposure have impacted ISS crew members during flight with symptoms such as rhinitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes [18]. In addition to astronaut health, preventing microbial growth during spaceflight is important to maintain the structural integrity of the spacecraft as some microbes are able to degrade mission-critical spacecraft materials such as plastics [19], sealants [20], and fibers [21] which can cause premature failure of spacecraft components. Microbial activity onboard has been known to cause issues in essential systems such as biofouling in water lines due to issues in the original design that has since been rectified [22]. In addition, capture of bacterial- and fungal-related airborne particles is a major function of the ISS air filtration system [23]. Increased levels of relative humidity facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially for fungi. Elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) in the air is sufficient to provide enough water availability to microbes to support growth in the dust [8, 24, 25], which can be predicted even under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework [26]. These elevated ERH conditions significantly alter community composition and change microbial function in terrestrial house dust [24, 25, 27]. On the ISS, the current NASA operational guidelines for relative humidity is to maintain it between 25 and 75% [28], but pockets of elevated moisture conditions are possible during the daily operations onboard. Examples include fungal growth on plant experiments onboard due to a ventilation failure that caused high ERH [29], fungal growth on fabric panels where a wet towel was placed [30] on various pieces of equipment used onboard [31], and microbial growth on free-floating condensate on the Russian station Mirin an unused section of the station [32]. However, we do not yet understand if we are able to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS as can be done on Earth. The goal of this project is to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS under varying moisture conditions using the time-of-wetness framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to actively grow a collection of microbes directly from a substrate that is onboard the ISS to model unexpected high moisture conditions. The results have important implications for protecting human health and spacecraft integrity during future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.Methodology Overview Dust samples were obtained from four vacuum bags that came from weekly housekeeping activities to clean the protective screen covers for the HEPA filters which are part of the ISS air ventilation system. Samples were returned to Earth, where they were incubated at varying constant ERH conditions (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100%) for 2 weeks. In addition, the time-of-wetness framework was used to model microbial growth at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for the quantification of bacteria and fungi for all samples. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to determine how microbial communities in the ISS dust changed for each ERH and time-of-wetness condition. In addition, a subset of these samples was observed via scanning electron microscopy to visualize microbial growth directly on the ISS dust samples.ISS dust samples All dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypo-allergenic filter system Oreck# PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard the ISS which the astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. It is important to note that we had no control over when, how much, or where these vacuums were used while onboard, which means other areas may have also been vacuumed in addition to the HEPA filter coverings. In total, ISS dust from four separate vacuum bags was returned to Earth and analyzed in this study. ISS vacuum bags 1–4 were collected by the ISS crew on GMT 264 (September 21, 2018), GMT 102 (April 12, 2019), GMT 243 (August 31, 2019), and GMT 286 (October 13, 2019) and returned to Earth on SpaceX16 (January 13, 2019), SpaceX-17 (July 3, 2019), and SpaceX-19 (January 7, 2020). In total, it took approximately 6, 5, 6, and 4 months for bags 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reach our lab at the Ohio State University from the actual collection date onboard ISS. For ISS vacuum bag 1, the full vacuum bag was sent directly to The Ohio State University Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. ISS vacuum bags 2–4 were first sent to the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry group at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA), and then, a subsample of dust was sent to us for analysis. In addition, we received dust samples that were frozen onboard the ISS, returned in cold stowage, and sent directly to our laboratory, where they were stored at − 80 °C until use (Additional file 1: Table S1).Incubations All incubation was completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25 °C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (aw) using an Aqualab™ Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA, USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50 mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset® HOBO® Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) to monitor ERH and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (three samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies [24]. Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined [25]. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day when relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold [26]. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (R/k), we first calculated the growth rates (k) for constant (24 h/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (R) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time of wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified on days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25-mg dust sample per day per bag). All incubation chambers were covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape.DNA extractions and qPCR DNA was extracted from all dust samples using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads) to allow for more efficient lysis of cells in the dust substrate [33]. Each DNA extraction run included a blank and was confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at − 20℃ until use. qPCR was used to determine fungal and bacterial concentrations for all samples with an Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 6 Flex System (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using QuantStudio Real-Time PCR Software version 1.3. All samples were diluted to a 50X solution in Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer solution, and triplicate qPCR measurements were made for each sample. For every plate run on qPCR, two wells of template controls were included, and all wells consisted of a 25-µL reaction volume, which included 2 µL of sample. Total fungal and bacterial quantities in samples were determined by the use of universal assays that measured at the whole kingdom level. SYBR® Green (Applied Biosystems™), forward primer (FF2) 5′-GGTTCTATTTTGTTGGTTTCTA-3′, and reverse primer (FR1) 5′-CTCTCAATCTGTCAATCCTTATT-3′ was used to quantify fungal concentration which targets the 18S rRNA gene [34]. Aspergillus fumigatus was grown on Difco™ Potato Dextrose Agar and after 14 days spores were collected, counted, and DNA extracted for use as standards for qPCR fungal quantification. For bacteria, TaqMan® master mix (Applied Biosystems™), forward primer 5′-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′, reverse prime 5′-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3′, and PROBE (6-FAM)-5′-CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′-(BHQ) was used to target the 16S rRNA gene [9, 34, 35]. Bacillus atrophaeus was grown in Difco™ Luria–Bertani Broth, Miller overnight, counted, and DNA extracted for qPCR bacterial quantification standards. Fungal and bacterial standards were counted using a Labomed microscope with a 20X air objective lens and InCyto DHC-N01-5 Neubauer Improved C-Chips. These standards were run in duplicate for each qPCR plate with a total of six dilutions ranging from 101 to 106 cells or spores/µL. For bacteria, this was reported as cells per milligram of dust, while fungi were reported as spore equivalents per milligram of dust. The term “spore equivalent” refers to the fact fungi are eukaryotic, and the DNA measured with qPCR could be from a spore or from another fungal structure present such as hyphae or different fungal propagules. qPCR cycling parameters for fungal and bacterial primer sets consisted of one cycle of 50℃ for 2 min and 95℃ for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 s and 60℃ for 1 min. All qPCR values were multiplied by a dilution factor (50X), and the 50 µL extraction volume was then divided by the dust mass of each sample. A subset of samples went through qPCR inhibition testing by spiking A. fumigatus and B. atrophaeus onto the dust with no inhibition of the reaction detected. The molecular methods used in this study, namely qPCR values are reported in cells/spore equivalents and will not account for differences in DNA extraction efficiency, amplification bias, or gene copy number between species [36, 37].Microbial sequencing All sequencing for dust samples was performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ at RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). All samples were sequenced for fungi, and a smaller subset was sequenced for bacteria. For fungal sequencing, ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) ribosomal DNA primers were used [38], while the bacteria used 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) primers [39] with 2 × 300 bp sequencing reads. The Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, bioinformatics pipeline was used to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data [40]. For fungi, primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt [41] plug-in and paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method [42]. Sequences were then trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with three low-quality base windows using the Quality-filter plugin [43]. Fungal sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with UNITE database reference sequences (version 9.0) [44]. Bacterial sequences were run through the Dada2 pipeline [45] and clustered by phylogeny [46]. Beta diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted UniFrac statistics with a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis function in QIIME2 [47]. Richness and Shannon alpha diversity metrics were calculated for all incubations and significance determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test statistic from QIIME2. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.0 [48], the User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2019 database [49], and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) [50] version 1.4 was used to identify fungal taxonomy. A note that an updated 2022 version of the UNITE database now exists, and we compared relative abundance data to our analyses of the 2019 database to which no significant differences for our samples were observed. Bacterial taxa were classified in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin [51] which utilized the Greengenes database version 13_8 [52]. All sequencing data has been submitted to NASA’s GeneLab database (GLDS-623) [53].Microscopy and total organic carbon A subset of dust samples from ISS bag 1 were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Approximately 1.25 mg of dust was placed on black double-sided carbon tape and attached to a SEM sample holder. These samples were then incubated in triplicates for several ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) for 2 weeks at 25 °C. After incubation, samples were coated with 25 nm of gold and placed in a Apreo™ LoVac Scanning Electron Microscope (Thermo Scientific™ Waltham, MA, USA) for visual observation. Microscopy preparation and analysis were completed at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (Ohio State University Columbus, OH, USA). In addition, we measured the total soluble organic carbon in the original dust and dust after incubation after 2 weeks at 85% and 100% ERH. A total of four samples were measured at each condition which included one from each bag. Each dust sample was placed into 35 mL of DI in a 50-mL falcon tube. The tubes were placed on a shaker table at 180 rpm for 30 min. After shaking, 30 mL of the solution was extracted and run through a 0.45-µm filter which was then used for analyses. Soluble organic carbon was measured on a Shimadzu TOC-V CSN (VELP Scientific, Inc. Deer Park, NY, USA).Statistical analyses Microbial quantities for constant ERH incubations at each ERH condition tested were compared to quantities in the original dust (no incubation) samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t tests and a Spearman rank correlation coefficient utilizing STATA (Version 16.1). Statistical significance was considered (P< 0.05). QIIME2 version 2021.8.0 was used to create a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot using Bray–Curtis and UniFrac distance matrices. The Adonis function was also used to compare ERH and TOW conditions for microbial species beta diversity while Kruskal–Wallis was used to determine significance for alpha diversity. The PCoA plot was imported into R Studio (version 2021.09.0 Build 351) for visualization. Statistical Analysis System® Studio, version 9.4, was used to compare taxonomic diversity between ERH conditions, time-of-wetness, frozen, and original dust samples. Species that did not occur in at least 10% of all samples were removed before analysis. All relative abundance data was transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function and combined with qPCR quantities to produce an absolute abundance value as previously described [25]. Taxonomy among samples was analyzed using the PROC MULTTEST FDR Test Mean function in SAS. False discovery rate was used instead of positive false discovery rate due to the relatively small sample size [54].Results Increased relative humidity conditions lead to increased microbial growth Dust was received from four vacuum bags from the ISS with an average initial fungal concentration of 4.39 × 106 spore equivalents (SE)/mg dust and an average bacterial load of 1.06 × 107 cells/mg dust. After incubating the dust samples for 2 weeks at different ERH conditions to simulate an unexpected high moisture event, the fungal concentration ranged from 4.22 × 106 SE/mg dust at 50% ERH to 2.10 × 1010 SE/mg dust at 100% ERH (Fig. 1, Table S2). Increased fungal concentration was associated with elevated ERH conditions after 2 weeks (Spearman rank correlation (rs) = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with significantly more fungal growth at 80% (P < 0.044) and 85–100% ERH (P < 0.0001) (Table S3). Bacterial concentration was significantly increased compared to the original load at 90% (P = 0.005) and 100% ERH (P = 0.0001) with a positive association between bacterial concentration and ERH (rs = 0.39, P = 0.0001) (Additional file 2: Figure S1A, Table S2–S3). Dust was also collected by tweezers from the ISS HEPA filters and returned frozen for analysis with lower fungal and bacterial loads compared to bulk dust samples (Additional file 1: Table S4). These results are similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [8, 24] and bacteria [8] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [24] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109 spore equivalents per milligram of dust when exposed to 100% ERH for 2 weeks. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Fungal growth concentrations of original dust and after constant equilibrium relative humidity incubations at 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 100% ERH at 25℃. Each fungal concentration represents the average value of four vacuum bags which included physical triplicates for each bag and triplicate qPCR concentrations for each sample for a total of 36 measurements per condition. Error bars represent the standard error of fungal quantities for each vacuum bag. * indicate statistically significant growth (P < 0.05) compared to the original dust using Satterthwaite two-sample t testOriginal dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) and dust incubated at 50% ERH for 2 weeks showed no visible signs of microbial growth, in scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 2A,B). At elevated relative humidity conditions of 85% and 100% ERH, we observed indications of active fungal growth on the dust substrate (Fig. 2C,D). This included elongated hyphae with conidia production prevalent on almost all dust surfaces, which indicates that fungal reproduction is occurring. In general, more of all of these structures were observed at 100% compared to 85% ERH, similar to other studies with Earth dust and carpet samples [24]. Our previous microscopy analyses in residential carpets also concluded that almost no fungal growth occurred even at high ERH conditions if house dust was not present, indicating the nutrients in dust are essential for active growth [24]. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ISS dust from the original dust (A) and incubations at 50% ERH (B) show fibrous dust materials, but no fungal growth. Fungal growth including spores, elongated hyphae, and different fungal propagules was observed in ISS dust incubated at 85% ERH (C) and 100% ERH (D) for 2 weeks at 25℃Total soluble organic carbon was measured in ISS dust samples that included the original dust as well as dust incubated at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks at 25℃ (Fig. 3). For each condition, a total of four samples were measured that included one sample per ISS bag collected. In the original dust, total soluble organic carbon ranged from 12.55 to 36.79 mg/L with no significant changes after a 2-week incubation at 85% ERH (10.2–29.05 mg/L, P = 0.52). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in soluble organic carbon after 2-week incubations at 100% ERH (1.76–8.08 mg/L, P= 0.048). This is a soluble organic carbon utilization rate of approximately 1.2 and 0.3 mg soluble carbon per day for 100% and 85% ERH conditions, respectively. From the original ISS dust samples, we measured an average of 22 mg soluble organic carbon per milligram of dust. In comparison, house dust from Earth-based residential homes contains 35 mg of total soluble organic carbon per mg of dust [8]. This indicates that dust from both the ISS and homes on Earth contains significantly more carbon than is required for fungal growth (~ 0.0072 mg soluble carbon/mg dust). Therefore, moisture continues to be the limiting factor for growth. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Total soluble organic carbon (TOC) measured in ISS dust in the original dust as well as in dust incubated (25°C) for 2 weeks at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions. Significant reductions in TOC were observed for 100% conditions but not 85% compared to original dust samples indicating potential fungal use of TOC in ISS dust. Each condition contained four samples (one from each ISS bag in this study), and error bars are the standard deviation of these four bags. * represents a statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in total soluble organic carbon compared to original dust samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t testFungal growth predictions vary based on maximum ERH Relative humidity often fluctuates in indoor spaces, so we applied the time-of-wetness framework to model fungal growth measured under varying ERH conditions (high moisture for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day). We observed an activation-limited growth model for elevated (85% ERH) conditions, while at saturated (100% ERH), we observed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). At both elevated and saturated conditions, growth was associated with increasing time per day at higher moisture levels (rs = 0.68, P = 0.015). Bacterial growth showed no significant difference between elevated and saturated conditions and did not align with any time-of-wetness growth model (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). On Earth, fungi in house dust samples differed and showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for both elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions, and bacteria also had insufficient growth to apply a model [25]. Effective growth constants and total fungal growth rates for the model are available in Additional file 1: Tables S5–S9. The differences in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS-built environments may be due to different microbial and chemical compositions of the dust because even Earth-based buildings in close proximity can differ. These differences can be attributed to many environmental factors such as the occupants inside, cleaning habits, building materials, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Fungal time-of-wetness modeling for elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Elevated conditions (orange) show an activation-limited growth model, while saturated conditions (green) show a deactivation-limited growth model. Error bars shown represent the standard error between all four ISS bags sampledMicrobial diversity changes as ERH conditions are altered We analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in the samples via DNA amplicon sequencing (Table S10). There was a total of 11,180,519 quality fungal reads and 2,502,228 quality bacterial reads present in all sequenced samples. A total of 107 fungal species and 127 bacterial species were present in at least 10% of samples. The most common fungal genera were Aspergillus (100% of samples), Penicilium (95%), and Rhodotorula (94%). The most common fungal species in all samples included Aspergillus sydowii (100%), Aspergillus unguis (100%), and Penicillium chrysogenum (90%). For bacteria, Bacillales (99%), Actinomycetales (99%), and Clostridiales (96%) were the most common order and the most common bacterial species were Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (81%), Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (78%), and Lactobacillus helveticus (74%). After incubation at constant ERH, fungal community composition differed by each bag (R2 = 0.233, P = 0.001) and ERH condition (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5A). In all varying ERH samples, fungal community composition also differed by bag (R2 = 0.098, P = 0.001) and varying ERH conditions (R2 = 0.090, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5B), though to a lesser degree compared to the constant ERH incubation. These differences were more pronounced when limiting the analysis to a single maximum ERH level or time elevated. For example, considering the 24-h incubations only for elevated and saturated conditions shows a more distinct difference in species (R2 = 0.201, P = 0.001). PCoA plots for all conditions is shown in Additional file 2: Figures S2–S4 and Additional file 1: Table S11). Bacterial beta diversity analyses showed similar trends of community composition changing with increased ERH and time-of-wetness conditions (Additional file 2: Figure S5, Additional file 1: Table S12). Finally, frozen dust samples were compared to the original dust and constant ERH incubation samples at 50, 85, and 100% ERH. For both fungi and bacteria, frozen samples clustered close to the original dust and 50% ERH samples but were more dissimilar to 85 and 100% ERH samples (Additional file 1: Figure S6, Additional file 1: Table S13). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) of beta diversity fungal species present in ISS dust after 2-week incubations at varying ERH conditions (A) and time-of-wetness conditions (B). Both scenarios show as ERH increases (green to red) the fungal species composition is alteredMoisture also impacted sample diversity. For fungal constant ERH incubations, richness was significantly decreased (Q < 0.05) compared to original dust samples starting at 85% ERH, while Shannon diversity differences appeared at 80% ERH (Fig. 6A, B, Additional file 1: Table S14). For time-of-wetness samples at saturated (100% ERH) conditions, there were significant changes in both fungal richness and Shannon diversity at extended times elevated (12, 18, and 24 h) compared to the shorter times tested (0 and 6 h) (Fig. 6C,D). We also limited analyses to specific ERH conditions and times elevated (Additional file 1: Table S15). Bacterial samples also showed significant changes in richness and Shannon diversity during constant ERH incubations at 85%, 90%, and 100% ERH compared to original dust samples, while time-of-wetness samples also showed significant differences between 50 and 100% ERH conditions for 24 h (Additional file 1: Figure S7A, Additional file 1: Table S16). Finally, frozen samples were compared to original dust samples as well as samples from constant ERH incubations at 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH. For bacteria, there was a significant difference in both richness and Shannon diversity for all conditions tested; however, fungi only showed these differences at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks compared to the frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S7B, Additional file 1: Table S17). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots for constant ERH, 2-week incubations (A, B), and time of wetness incubations (C, D). For constant incubations, the x-axis represents the original dust and ERH conditions after 2 weeks of incubation (A, B). Time-of-wetness incubations show the time elevated on the x-axis as well as the ERH conditions tested (50% = red, 85% = green, and 100% = blue). Note that 50% of ERH conditions for time-of-wetness samples were only performed at a time elevated of one (24 h per day)Differential abundance analyses were used to compare fungal species between all incubation conditions in this study. Comparing fungal species at non-elevated (original dust, 50, 60, 70% ERH) to elevated (80, 85, 90, 100% ERH) conditions identified a total of 77 species more abundant at non-elevated conditions compared to only six species more abundant at elevated conditions (Additional file 1: Table S18). This indicates that at elevated ERH conditions (> 80% ERH) fungi such as Aspergillus sydowii (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus unguis (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus nidulans (P < 0.0001), Aspergiullus subversicolor (P < 0.0001), Penicillium chrysogenum (P = 0.0016), and Aspegillus hongkongensis (P = 0.0071) may be growing, significantly reducing fungal diversity in the ISS dust. Under varying relative humidity conditions, there were generally more species associated with lower moisture conditions (Additional file 1: Tables S19–S21). These analyses were also performed for bacteria and found no significant differences in bacterial species between any of the incubation times and ERH conditions tested (Additional file 1: Table S23). Aspergillus is the dominant genus, and it becomes more dominant as ERH and time elevated increases (Fig. 7). A similar trend is also shown in the constant ERH incubations (Additional file 1: Figure S8), where Aspergillus is the most dominant at 85% and 90% ERH. Interestingly, at 100%, Penicillium starts to grow significantly more compared to other elevated ERH conditions (80%, 85%, and 90% ERH). Finally, we compared original dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) to frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S9). For relative abundance, the original dust samples contained more Aspergillus, Cyberlinda, and Alternaria, while the frozen samples appeared to contain more Rhodotorula, Malassezia, and Rhodosporidiobolus. There was also a significant difference in absolute abundance for all fungal genera with up to 104 spore eq/mg dust present in the original dust samples compared to the frozen samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Mean relative (A) and absolute (B) abundance data for the fungal genus of time-of-wetness samples. Abundances represent elevated (85%) and saturated (100%) relative humidity conditions at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h time-of-wetness samples as well as unmodified (50%) at 24 h. The mean abundances here represent the average for day 5, 10, 14, and 21 dust samples for each relative humidity and time-of-wetness condition for the four total ISS vacuum bags tested in this study (a total of 12 samples for each ERH/time-of-wetness condition)Discussion To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [28]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5 h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [58] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [59, 60]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. In ISS dust after 2 weeks exposed to constant ERH conditions significant growth for fungi occurred at 80% RH, while for bacteria this occurred at 90% ERH compared to original dust samples (no ERH exposure). This is similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [5, 8] and bacteria [5] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [8] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109SE per milligram dust when exposed to 100% RH for 2 weeks. The time-of-wetness framework has also been applied to growth in Earth-based house dust samples that can be compared to samples from ISS dust. Time-of-wetness samples showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for fungi for both elevated (85% RH) and saturated (100% RH) conditions [9]. These results differ in contrast to the ISS dust where elevated RH fungi showed an activation-limited growth model and at saturated conditions showed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). There may be several potential reasons for this difference in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS built environments. Generally, every indoor environment has a different microbial dust composition. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. These results offer a path to improved prediction of fungal growth in specialized indoor spaces modeled on fluctuating ERH conditions. However, it is important to restate that these incubations were performed on Earth and not in environmental conditions experienced in low-Earth orbit such as microgravity, elevated CO2, and low-dose radiation, all of which may affect microbial growth and microbial composition. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered. Given the difficulty of procuring spaceflight samples, we have a relatively small sample size (dust from four ISS vacuum bags), but this should be sufficient to provide valuable information. These limitations highlight the need for future on-orbit studies to better understand this microbiology during actual spaceflight conditions.Conclusion Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].Supplementary Information 40168_2024_1864_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (1.7MB, pdf) Additional file 1: Table S1: Frozen dust sample dates and location.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by pronounced bone resorption. A clear link between estrogen deficiency and reduced bone mass is evident by the increased prevalence of osteoporosis in women vs. men [1] and the direct association between circulating estrogen levels and rates of bone loss [2]–[5]. In addition, estrogen replacement serves to protect against skeletal fractures and loss of bone [6] primarily by inhibiting bone resorption [7]. The preponderance of literature examining the effects of estrogen status and bone remodeling has attributed the association to the direct effects of estrogen on bone cell activity. However, there are other possible mechanisms whereby postmenopausal bone loss may be influenced and modulated. There is increasing evidence in the literature that the osseous vasculature influences bone remodeling. For example, vascular endothelial cells release factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) that are known to modulate osteoclast and osteoblast activity [8]–[11]. In addition, the osseous resistance vasculature regulates skeletal perfusion and, consequently, fluid filtration and interstitial fluid flow, which can affect bone cell activity through release of autocrine/paracine factors [12]–[17]. Dysfunction of these vascular mechanisms could therefore contribute to postmenopausal and old age-related osteoporosis. Indeed, attenuated bone and marrow blood flow has been reported in healthy humans (>60 years of age) [18], [19], senescent rats [20]–[22] and rabbits [23] and is associated with osteopenia [24]. Old age-related decrements in skeletal perfusion also correspond with diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), reduced vascular NO bioavailability, and diminished trabecular bone volume and material properties of the femur in male rats [20]–[22]. Thus, aging and estrogen loss may contribute to enhanced bone turnover in females through impairment of endothelial responsiveness in the skeletal circulation. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone blood vessels, and whether this is associated with changes in trabecular bone volume. Estrogen levels were modified in young and old female rats through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement. We hypothesized that the lower estrogen levels in old intact and young and old ovariectomized (OVX) rats would be associated with lower femoral PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and that estrogen replacement in young and old OVX rats would enhance PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation through a NO signaling pathway. Furthermore, we hypothesized that PNA endothelial vasodilator function would be directly associated with trabecular bone volume.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Ethical Approval The procedures used in this study were approved by the University of Florida and West Virginia University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health ( Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Young (4 mon old) and old (22 mon old) virgin female Fischer-344 rats were obtained from the vendor (National Institute of Aging colony, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and divided into six groups: 1) young intact (n = 10), 2) old intact (n = 11), 3) young OVX (n = 10), 4) old OVX (n = 9), 5) young OVX+E2 (n = 11), and 6) old OVX+E2 (n = 10). After arrival all animals were housed for an additional 8 weeks in a temperature-controlled (23±2°C) room with a 12∶12 h light dark cycle. Rats in the latter four groups underwent ovariectomy surgery and were housed post-operatively for 8 weeks. Thus, at the time of sacrifice young animals were at least 6 months of age and old rats were at least 24 months of age. At 6 months of old, Fischer-344 rats are considered sexually-mature young adults, and at 24 months of age are considered senescent when mortality rates are ≥30% [25]. To control for the levels of exogenous estrogen, all rats were provided with a phytoestrogen-free diet and tap water ad libitum. Prior to sacrifice, at least two complete estrous cycles were monitored in all female rats by daily vaginal smears. At the time of sacrifice, 3 ml of blood was collected in chilled tubes containing dipotassium EDTA. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min, and the plasma was collected and stored at −80°C for later analysis. The ovaries (in intact females), uterus and cervix were dissected and trimmed of connective tissue and fat to obtain uterine mass. Plasma estrogen was determined with ELISA immunoassay (Estradiol EIA kit, Oxford Biomedical; Oxford, MI). Rats were sacrificed at 6 and 24 months of age. Surgical Procedures To examine the influence of circulating estrogen on the vasomotor properties of the femoral PNA, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%/oxygen balance) and subjected to bi-lateral ovariectomy according to standard procedures as described previously [26], [27]. Briefly, bilateral dorsolateral incisions were made through the top layer of skin. The underlying muscles were bluntly dissected until the ovary and fallopian tube were located. For rats in the OVX groups, the fallopian tube was ligated with absorbable suture and the ovary was removed. Once the surrounding fat pad was replaced within the abdominal cavity, the musculature and outer layer of skin was sutured. Estrogen replacement in the OVX+E2 groups was performed simultaneous to the OVX procedure. Two 0.05 mg 17beta-estradiol 60-day slow release pellets (Innovative Research) were implanted subcutaneously near the scapulae. In Vitro PNA Studies Rats were anesthetized (isoflurane 5%/O2 balance) and euthanized by removing the heart. To assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA, in vitro experiments were performed. The femur and surrounding musculature was removed and placed in a dissecting dish containing physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) at 4°C. The PNA was isolated from the femur and surrounding muscle tissue by use of a stereomicroscope as previously described [21], [22]. Briefly, the PNA was cannulated onto glass micropipettes, secured with 11-0 nylon microfilament suture (Alcon), and the vessel chamber placed under an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with a video camera (Panasonic BP310), video caliper (307A horizontal video caliper, Colorado Video), and data-acquisition system (PowerLab) for the measurement of intraluminal diameter. The PNAs were pressurized to 44 mmHg (60 cmH2O) with two hydrostatic pressure reservoirs. This intravascular pressure was selected based on previously reported intravascular pressures of 43±1.8 mmHg and 46±2.6 mmHg in skeletal muscle resistance arteries of similar size to the PNA in normotensive rats [28]. PNAs were then checked for leaks, and those that were leak free were warmed to 37°C and allowed to develop spontaneous baseline tone (≥1 h). Vessels that leaked or did not develop at least 20% spontaneous tone were discarded. Evaluation of Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (ACh; 10−9–10−4 M) to the bathing medium. Prior to each concentration-response protocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completion of the experimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAs were determined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period in calcium-free PSS buffer. Evaluation of Endothelium Signaling Pathways PNAs were cannulated and allowed to develop spontaneous tone. Vasodilation to ACh was evaluated after a 20-min incubation with one of the following: 1) PSS buffer alone, 2) PSS buffer containing the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 10−5 M), 3) PSS buffer containing l-NAME (10−5 M) plus the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (Indo; 10−5 M) [21], [22], [29], [30]. Evaluation of Endothelium-Independent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of DEA NONOate (DEA; 10−9–10−4 M) to the bathing medium. Prior to each concentration-response protocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completion of the experimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAs were determined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period in calcium-free PSS buffer. Determination of Trabecular Bone Volume Trabecular bone volume of the distal femur metaphysis was assessed using microcomputed tomography (microCT; Skyscan 1172) as previously described [21]. Femora were wrapped in parafilm to prevent drying during the scanning. Scans were obtained using an x-ray source, set at 60 kV and 167 µA over an angular range of 180 degrees (rotational steps of 0.40 degrees) with a 12-µm pixel size. Projection images were reconstructed using standard Skyscan software. The trabecular bone compartment was segmented from the cortical shell for 50 slices in a region ∼0.5-mm proximal to the most proximal portion of the growth plate for each animal. Images were binarized (threshold of 100–255) and trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was assessed. Solutions and drugs Stock solutions were prepared in distilled water; whereby ACh was frozen at −20°C and serial dilutions of the ACh stock solution were prepared daily. Serial dilutions of DEA NONOate were prepared fresh as needed. Serial dilutions of the stock solutions were prepared daily. All drugs were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Statistical Analysis Vasodilator responses were expressed as a percentage of maximal relaxation according to the following formula: where Dm is the maximal inner diameter recorded at 60 cmH2O in calcium-free PSS, Ds is the steady-state inner diameter recorded after each addition of the vasodilator substance, and Db is the initial baseline inner diameter recorded immediately prior to the first addition of ACh. One-way ANOVAs were used to determine the significance of differences in body mass, uterine mass, uterine∶body mass ratio, plasma estrogen concentration, and spontaneous tone and maximal diameter of the PNAs. Repeated measures ANOVAs with pairwise comparisons were used to determine the significance of differences among age and within factors for vasodilator responses. To examine the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume according to age and estrogen status, linear regression analyses were measured in young and old rats. In addition, regression analyses were performed examining the relations between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen, uterine mass, and peak vasodilation in old and old OVX rats. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance was defined as P≤0.05.",

Values are mean ± SE. Plasma estrogen concentration for some of the animals in the old intact (5 out of 11), young OVX (1 out of 10) and old OVX (5 out of 9) groups was below the detectable range (5 pg/ml) for the ELISA immunoassay technique used to measure estrogen levels. Therefore, the estrogen concentrations reported for these three groups are an overestimate of the actual levels because estrogen values for these animals could not be included in the analysis. For this reason, we provide median and range values, as well as report uterine mass as a surrogate marker for estrogen concentration. Plasma estrogen concentration in young intact animals (median 62 pg/ml; range 26–103 pg/ml) was greater than that in old intact rats (median 25 pg/ml; range 18–36 pg/ml). OVX decreased plasma estrogen in young rats (median 22 pg/ml; range 6–32 pg/ml), but did not alter estrogen levels in old rats (median 34 pg/ml; range 18–49 pg/ml). In young animals OVX+E2 increased plasma estrogen (median 40 pg/ml; range 35–54 pg/ml) above that in the young OVX group and to a level similar of that in the young intact group. In the old rats OVX+E2 increased plasma estrogen concentration (median 51 pg/ml; range 31–78 pg/ml) to levels above that in both the old intact and OVX groups. Uterine mass (Table 1) was lower in old intact vs. young intact rats. OVX decreased uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matched animals. OVX+E2 elevated uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matched OVX rats. Uterine mass was also greater in old OVX+E2 than in old intact animals, whereas uterine mass was lower in young OVX+E2 relative to young intact. Age and condition effects on uterine∶body mass ratio were similar to those of uterine mass (Table 1). Spontaneous tone of the PNA did not differ among groups (Table 1). However, PNA maximal diameters in young and old OVX+E2 were significantly greater than that of age-matched intact and OVX PNAs (Table 1). Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses ACh-induced vasodilation of the femoral PNA was lower in old intact relative to that in young intact (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of the NOS pathway with L-NAME abolished differences in vasodilation between the two age groups (Fig. 1A). The combined inhibition of the NOS and COX pathways further lowered vasodilation of PNAs from young rats, and there remained no aging differences (Fig. 1A). Figure 1.

There were no differences in the vasodilator response between young and old OVX rats under any of the three conditions.

There were no differences in vasodilator responses between young and old OVX+E2 rats under any of the three conditions.

Values are means ± S.E; n = 9–11 animals per group. *Indicates the vasodilator response is significantly different between groups (P<0.05).Ovariectomy eliminated the old age-related difference in PNA vasodilation (Fig. 1B) that was evidenced between young and old intact animals. L-NAME lowered vasodilator responses in PNAs from both young and old OVX rats, indicating that most of the vasodilator response occurred through the NOS signaling mechanism. The combination of L-NAME and Indo abolished all vasodilation in the PNA of OVX animals (Fig. 1B). Ovariectomy with estrogen replacement also showed no age-related difference in vasodilation between young and old rats (Fig. 1C). NOS inhibition lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses in OVX+E2 rats, whereas the addition of the COX inhibitor Indo had little further effect in PNAs from both young and old rats (Fig. 1C). In young rats, the lowering of estrogen levels with OVX lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas estrogen repletion in OVX+E2 rats restored vasodilation to levels equivalent to that in young intact rats (Fig. 2A). In PNAs from old rats, OVX had no effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses (Fig. 3A). The chronic addition of exogenous estrogen elevated vasodilation of PNAs from old rats (Fig. 3A) to levels that were similar to those in young animals (Fig. 1C). Figure 2.

Trabecular Bone Volume In young rats, the lowering of plasma estrogen concentration through OVX reduced trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) by 43% compared to young intact (Fig. 2B). Estrogen replacement in OVX+E2 rats increased bone volume to levels similar to those in young intact rats (Fig. 2B). OVX in old rats had no effect on trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen resulted in 28% higher trabecular bone volume compared to controls (Fig. 3B). Regression Analyses Trabecular bone volume was significantly correlated to peak vasodilation in both young and old rats (Fig. 2C and 3C) whereby regression analyses indicated R2 values of 0.641 and 0.671 in young and old rats, respectively. In addition, in rats with low estrogen status (i.e., young OVX, old intact and old OVX), there was no relation between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B). However, these groups displayed a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C). Figure 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion The purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral diaphyseal principal nutrient artery, and whether these putative changes in vascular endothelial function are associated with alterations in trabecular bone volume. In young rats, the results demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabecular bone volume in the femur (Fig. 2B), whereas replacement of estrogen following ovariectomy maintains both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume. In old rats, ovariectomy had no effect on circulating estrogen levels, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) or trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen following ovariectomy elevated endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) and increased bone volume (Fig. 3B). The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) and old (Fig. 3C) rats. To our knowledge, these are the first data to report the effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone from young and old animals, and the first to examine the relation between vascular function and bone properties with age and estrogen status as variables. It has long been appreciated that estrogen can have positive effects on the skeletal system. For example, during adolescent growth estrogen is the critical reproductive factor for both girls and boys [31]. Additionally, a fall in estrogen concentration below 30 pg/mL during menopause corresponds to the period of accelerated bone loss [31]. The loss of estrogen following menopause creates an imbalance between bone resorption and formation that leads to a net loss of bone [32]. Many postmenopausal women exhibit reduced bone mass as well as high-turnover bone metabolism, and the reversal of these conditions are observed following estrogen replacement [33]. The preservation of bone mass during this period requires exogenous administration of estrogen sufficient to raise plasma concentrations to 50 pg/mL [31]. Estrogen receptors are present on osteoblasts [34], [35], but the actions of estrogen on these cells and osteoblast-like cells have been variable [4]. A recent study suggests that the mechanism(s) of action of estrogen on bone cell activity is related to the control of function and lifespan of osteoclasts, which serves to ultimately minimize bone resorption [33]. The exact mechanism(s) through which estrogen acts to modulate bone cell activity is not completely understood, allowing for the possibility that non-skeletal tissue may act to modulate bone cell activity [31]. We hypothesize that one such mechanism is related to bone vascular endothelial function and its ability to 1) directly influence bone cell activity through local release of endothelium-derived signaling molecules such as NO and PGI2 [36], [37], and 2) to regulate skeletal perfusion, which could indirectly affect bone cell activity through its impact on fluid filtration out of the vascular compartment and, correspondingly, interstitial fluid pressure in bone [13], [37]–[40]. There is a growing body of literature that supports the notion that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity [40]–[42]. In regard to old age-related bone loss, previous studies in humans and animals have shown compromised bone and marrow blood flow are associated with osteopenia [18]–[22] and studies in male rats have shown impaired bone vascular endothelial function is related to old age-induced bone loss [21], [22]. Additionally, a recent study has reported that a program of low-intensity endurance exercise training that elicits low mechanical strain on bone restores endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation of the PNA and increases trabecular bone volume and mineral density in the distal femur of old male rats [21]. The results demonstrated that old age-induced decrements and training-induced enhancement of NO-mediated vasodilation of the bone vasculature are positively correlated with changes in the bone properties [21], [22]. Results from the present study also demonstrate an association between NO-mediated vasodilation of bone arteries and trabecular bone volume when estrogen status is altered through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement (Fig. 2C and 3C). Although these findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that bone vascular endothelial function is coupled to bone remodeling activity, these results alone are inconclusive since estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity, which could be independent of each other. Therefore, we sought to determine whether a relation exists between vascular endothelial function and bone volume in animals where estrogen concentration was low, i.e., the young OVX and the old intact and OVX groups. Regression analyses indicated that there were no relations (P>0.05) between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B), a biomarker for reproductive hormone status, indicating that the direct effects of estrogen on cancellous bone volume are negligible in these low-estrogen groups. However, there was a significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur. These findings provide support for the concept of a vascular coupling mechanism in bone. This conclusion of a coupling mechanism between the bone vasculature and bone mass is further supported by two studies in humans, where forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness, used as a surrogate measure of bone endothelial function, was positively correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [43], [44]. Thus, in groups without the potentially confounding influence of estrogen, the relation between endothelial function and bone mass is still evident. Intact young and old female rats regulate vasodilation of the femoral PNA primarily through a NOS signaling mechanism and to a lesser extent through a COX signaling pathway (Fig. 1A). These regulatory mechanisms are similar to those of male animals, whereby endothelium-dependent vasodilation is mediated predominantly via the NOS signaling cascade [21], [22]. The old age-associated decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in female rats results from declines in NO-mediated regulation, which is also similar to that observed in male rats. In the absence of estrogen (OVX group), vasodilation in the presence of L-NAME alone is eliminated (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, with estrogen replacement the regulating vasodilator mechanism shifts from the primarily NO signaling pathway to one that includes NO and the putative endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, as indicated by the significant vasodilation that occurs in estrogen replete rats when both NOS and COX signaling pathways are blocked (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the addition of estrogen from an exogenous source does not simply restore the regulatory mechanisms for vasodilation but alters the signaling mechanisms through which the peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the bone resistance vasculature is achieved. A shift in the mechanism of endothelium-dependent vasodilation with OVX has also been reported in mesenteric arteries. In intact rats, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arteries is mediated through both the NOS and COX signaling pathways; OVX diminished the NO-mediated component and augmented the contribution of the COX signaling pathway [45]. The decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with OVX in young rats has also been reported to occur in other vascular beds. For example, OVX has been shown to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of pulmonary arteries [46], the thoracic aorta [46], and coronary resistance arteries [26] in young rats. However, several studies examining the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone arteries of young animals have reported results that are dissimilar to those of the present investigation. In the first study, arterial segments from rabbits were isolated from the metaphyseal cancellous bone and the diaphyseal bone marrow of the femur six weeks after OVX [47]. The vessel segments with a diameter of ∼250 µm were cut into rings and two 40 µm diameter steel wires were passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. Changes in isometric force were measured with increasing concentrations of ACh after the arterial rings were preconstricted with norepinephrine. The results indicated that OVX did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxation [47]. The disparity of results compared to the current study could be due to several factors, including differences in 1) the animal species studied and 2) the techniques employed to study the vascular responses. For instance, unlike rats and humans, rabbits do not undergo the various stages of the estrous cycle [48]. Also, the wire myograph technique used is not ideal for determination of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in small diameter vessels because of the potential for the wires to damage endothelial cells as they are passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. The second study with disparate results relative to those of the current study investigated the effects of OVX in medullary arterioles from the femur of rats using the pressurized vessel technique [49]. Vasodilation induced by ACh was not different between medullary arterioles from intact and OVX rats. The discrepancy in findings may result from differences in the strain of rat studied (Fischer-344 vs. Sprague Dawley), age of the animals at sacrifice (6 and 24 months vs. 3 to 3 ½ months) and, most probably, differences in the period of OVX (2 months vs. 7–10 days). Few studies have examined the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation with advanced age. Castillo et al. [50] reported that relaxation of aortic rings to ACh was reduced in 20-month-old OVX rats. In contrast, OVX had no further effect to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of coronary resistance arteries [26] and femoral PNAs (present study) from old rats. These results indicate that the old age-associated decline in circulating estrogen may contribute to the overall reduction in endothelial cell vasodilator responsiveness that occurs with advancing age [21], [22], [27], [29]. The lack of bone loss with ovariectomy in the aged animals was counterintuitive to anticipated results and other published reports. For example, ovariectomy in rats 18 months of age has shown volume decrements in long bones as well as the vertebrae [51]–[53]. However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports on bone responses to ovariectomy utilizing rats of such an advanced age (i.e., 24 months) as the current investigation. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabecular bone volume (Fig. 2B) in the femur of young, but not in old female rats (Figs. 3A and 3B). Estrogen replacement following ovariectomy maintains and enhances both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume in young and old animals, respectively. The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) and old (Fig. 3C) rats, indicating a possible coupling mechanism between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling activity. Unfortunately, these results alone are inconclusive due to the fact that estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity that are independent of each other. However, in young OVX and old intact and OVX animals, where circulating estrogen levels are low with negligible effects on cancellous bone volume (Figs. 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B), regression analysis demonstrated a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur. These results provide support for a mechanism coupling vascular endothelial vasodilator signaling with bone volume.",

Copyright notice ID: 3502426 PMID: 23185266 Abstract Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.Introduction Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by pronounced bone resorption. A clear link between estrogen deficiency and reduced bone mass is evident by the increased prevalence of osteoporosis in women vs. men [1] and the direct association between circulating estrogen levels and rates of bone loss [2]–[5]. In addition, estrogen replacement serves to protect against skeletal fractures and loss of bone [6] primarily by inhibiting bone resorption [7]. The preponderance of literature examining the effects of estrogen status and bone remodeling has attributed the association to the direct effects of estrogen on bone cell activity. However, there are other possible mechanisms whereby postmenopausal bone loss may be influenced and modulated. There is increasing evidence in the literature that the osseous vasculature influences bone remodeling. For example, vascular endothelial cells release factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) that are known to modulate osteoclast and osteoblast activity [8]–[11]. In addition, the osseous resistance vasculature regulates skeletal perfusion and, consequently, fluid filtration and interstitial fluid flow, which can affect bone cell activity through release of autocrine/paracine factors [12]–[17]. Dysfunction of these vascular mechanisms could therefore contribute to postmenopausal and old age-related osteoporosis. Indeed, attenuated bone and marrow blood flow has been reported in healthy humans (>60 years of age) [18], [19], senescent rats [20]–[22] and rabbits [23] and is associated with osteopenia [24]. Old age-related decrements in skeletal perfusion also correspond with diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), reduced vascular NO bioavailability, and diminished trabecular bone volume and material properties of the femur in male rats [20]–[22]. Thus, aging and estrogen loss may contribute to enhanced bone turnover in females through impairment of endothelial responsiveness in the skeletal circulation. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone blood vessels, and whether this is associated with changes in trabecular bone volume. Estrogen levels were modified in young and old female rats through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement. We hypothesized that the lower estrogen levels in old intact and young and old ovariectomized (OVX) rats would be associated with lower femoral PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and that estrogen replacement in young and old OVX rats would enhance PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation through a NO signaling pathway. Furthermore, we hypothesized that PNA endothelial vasodilator function would be directly associated with trabecular bone volume.Materials and Methods Ethical Approval The procedures used in this study were approved by the University of Florida and West Virginia University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health ( Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Young (4 mon old) and old (22 mon old) virgin female Fischer-344 rats were obtained from the vendor (National Institute of Aging colony, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and divided into six groups: 1) young intact (n = 10), 2) old intact (n = 11), 3) young OVX (n = 10), 4) old OVX (n = 9), 5) young OVX+E2 (n = 11), and 6) old OVX+E2 (n = 10). After arrival all animals were housed for an additional 8 weeks in a temperature-controlled (23±2°C) room with a 12∶12 h light dark cycle. Rats in the latter four groups underwent ovariectomy surgery and were housed post-operatively for 8 weeks. Thus, at the time of sacrifice young animals were at least 6 months of age and old rats were at least 24 months of age. At 6 months of old, Fischer-344 rats are considered sexually-mature young adults, and at 24 months of age are considered senescent when mortality rates are ≥30% [25]. To control for the levels of exogenous estrogen, all rats were provided with a phytoestrogen-free diet and tap water ad libitum. Prior to sacrifice, at least two complete estrous cycles were monitored in all female rats by daily vaginal smears. At the time of sacrifice, 3 ml of blood was collected in chilled tubes containing dipotassium EDTA. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min, and the plasma was collected and stored at −80°C for later analysis. The ovaries (in intact females), uterus and cervix were dissected and trimmed of connective tissue and fat to obtain uterine mass. Plasma estrogen was determined with ELISA immunoassay (Estradiol EIA kit, Oxford Biomedical; Oxford, MI). Rats were sacrificed at 6 and 24 months of age.Surgical Procedures To examine the influence of circulating estrogen on the vasomotor properties of the femoral PNA, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%/oxygen balance) and subjected to bi-lateral ovariectomy according to standard procedures as described previously [26], [27]. Briefly, bilateral dorsolateral incisions were made through the top layer of skin. The underlying muscles were bluntly dissected until the ovary and fallopian tube were located. For rats in the OVX groups, the fallopian tube was ligated with absorbable suture and the ovary was removed. Once the surrounding fat pad was replaced within the abdominal cavity, the musculature and outer layer of skin was sutured. Estrogen replacement in the OVX+E2 groups was performed simultaneous to the OVX procedure. Two 0.05 mg 17beta-estradiol 60-day slow release pellets (Innovative Research) were implanted subcutaneously near the scapulae. In Vitro PNA Studies Rats were anesthetized (isoflurane 5%/O2 balance) and euthanized by removing the heart. To assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA, in vitro experiments were performed. The femur and surrounding musculature was removed and placed in a dissecting dish containing physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) at 4°C. The PNA was isolated from the femur and surrounding muscle tissue by use of a stereomicroscope as previously described [21], [22]. Briefly, the PNA was cannulated onto glass micropipettes, secured with 11-0 nylon microfilament suture (Alcon), and the vessel chamber placed under an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with a video camera (Panasonic BP310), video caliper (307A horizontal video caliper, Colorado Video), and data-acquisition system (PowerLab) for the measurement of intraluminal diameter. The PNAs were pressurized to 44 mmHg (60 cmH2O) with two hydrostatic pressure reservoirs. This intravascular pressure was selected based on previously reported intravascular pressures of 43±1.8 mmHg and 46±2.6 mmHg in skeletal muscle resistance arteries of similar size to the PNA in normotensive rats [28]. PNAs were then checked for leaks, and those that were leak free were warmed to 37°C and allowed to develop spontaneous baseline tone (≥1 h). Vessels that leaked or did not develop at least 20% spontaneous tone were discarded.Evaluation of Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (ACh; 10−9–10−4 M) to the bathing medium. Prior to each concentration-response protocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completion of the experimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAs were determined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period in calcium-free PSS buffer.Evaluation of Endothelium Signaling Pathways PNAs were cannulated and allowed to develop spontaneous tone. Vasodilation to ACh was evaluated after a 20-min incubation with one of the following: 1) PSS buffer alone, 2) PSS buffer containing the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 10−5 M), 3) PSS buffer containing l-NAME (10−5 M) plus the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (Indo; 10−5 M) [21], [22], [29], [30].Evaluation of Endothelium-Independent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of DEA NONOate (DEA; 10−9–10−4 M) to the bathing medium. Prior to each concentration-response protocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completion of the experimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAs were determined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period in calcium-free PSS buffer.Determination of Trabecular Bone Volume Trabecular bone volume of the distal femur metaphysis was assessed using microcomputed tomography (microCT; Skyscan 1172) as previously described [21]. Femora were wrapped in parafilm to prevent drying during the scanning. Scans were obtained using an x-ray source, set at 60 kV and 167 µA over an angular range of 180 degrees (rotational steps of 0.40 degrees) with a 12-µm pixel size. Projection images were reconstructed using standard Skyscan software. The trabecular bone compartment was segmented from the cortical shell for 50 slices in a region ∼0.5-mm proximal to the most proximal portion of the growth plate for each animal. Images were binarized (threshold of 100–255) and trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was assessed.Solutions and drugs Stock solutions were prepared in distilled water; whereby ACh was frozen at −20°C and serial dilutions of the ACh stock solution were prepared daily. Serial dilutions of DEA NONOate were prepared fresh as needed. Serial dilutions of the stock solutions were prepared daily. All drugs were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO).Statistical Analysis Vasodilator responses were expressed as a percentage of maximal relaxation according to the following formula: where Dm is the maximal inner diameter recorded at 60 cmH2O in calcium-free PSS, Ds is the steady-state inner diameter recorded after each addition of the vasodilator substance, and Db is the initial baseline inner diameter recorded immediately prior to the first addition of ACh. One-way ANOVAs were used to determine the significance of differences in body mass, uterine mass, uterine∶body mass ratio, plasma estrogen concentration, and spontaneous tone and maximal diameter of the PNAs. Repeated measures ANOVAs with pairwise comparisons were used to determine the significance of differences among age and within factors for vasodilator responses. To examine the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume according to age and estrogen status, linear regression analyses were measured in young and old rats. In addition, regression analyses were performed examining the relations between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen, uterine mass, and peak vasodilation in old and old OVX rats. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance was defined as P≤0.05.Results Animal and PNA Characteristics Body mass (Table 1) was higher in old vs. young intact animals. Body mass was greater in young OVX vs. young intact, and OVX+E2 decreased body mass in both young and old animals compared to age-matched OVX groups. In addition, body mass was lower in old OVX+E2 than in old intact animals. Table 1. Tissue and principal nutrient artery (PNA) characteristics in young and old intact, OVX, and OVX+E2 rats.

Values are mean ± SE. Plasma estrogen concentration for some of the animals in the old intact (5 out of 11), young OVX (1 out of 10) and old OVX (5 out of 9) groups was below the detectable range (5 pg/ml) for the ELISA immunoassay technique used to measure estrogen levels. Therefore, the estrogen concentrations reported for these three groups are an overestimate of the actual levels because estrogen values for these animals could not be included in the analysis. For this reason, we provide median and range values, as well as report uterine mass as a surrogate marker for estrogen concentration. Plasma estrogen concentration in young intact animals (median 62 pg/ml; range 26–103 pg/ml) was greater than that in old intact rats (median 25 pg/ml; range 18–36 pg/ml). OVX decreased plasma estrogen in young rats (median 22 pg/ml; range 6–32 pg/ml), but did not alter estrogen levels in old rats (median 34 pg/ml; range 18–49 pg/ml). In young animals OVX+E2 increased plasma estrogen (median 40 pg/ml; range 35–54 pg/ml) above that in the young OVX group and to a level similar of that in the young intact group. In the old rats OVX+E2 increased plasma estrogen concentration (median 51 pg/ml; range 31–78 pg/ml) to levels above that in both the old intact and OVX groups. Uterine mass (Table 1) was lower in old intact vs. young intact rats. OVX decreased uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matched animals. OVX+E2 elevated uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matched OVX rats. Uterine mass was also greater in old OVX+E2 than in old intact animals, whereas uterine mass was lower in young OVX+E2 relative to young intact. Age and condition effects on uterine∶body mass ratio were similar to those of uterine mass (Table 1). Spontaneous tone of the PNA did not differ among groups (Table 1). However, PNA maximal diameters in young and old OVX+E2 were significantly greater than that of age-matched intact and OVX PNAs (Table 1).Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses ACh-induced vasodilation of the femoral PNA was lower in old intact relative to that in young intact (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of the NOS pathway with L-NAME abolished differences in vasodilation between the two age groups (Fig. 1A). The combined inhibition of the NOS and COX pathways further lowered vasodilation of PNAs from young rats, and there remained no aging differences (Fig. 1A). Figure 1.

Open in a new tab The PNA responses are determined in young and old A) intact, B) ovariectomized (OVX), and C) ovariectomized and estrogen replaced (OVX+E2) female rats. A. There was an age-related difference in vasodilator responses between young and old INTACT female rats. Blockade with L-NAME significantly reduced vasodilation in both groups (P<0.05) and abolished the age-related difference in the vasodilator response. The combined blockade with L-NAME and Indo further reduced PNA vasodilation in the young rats (P<0.05). B. There were no differences in the vasodilator response between young and old OVX rats under any of the three conditions. Blockade with L-NAME significantly reduced vasodilation in both groups (P<0.05), and the combined blockade further diminished vasodilation in both OVX groups (P<0.05). C. There were no differences in vasodilator responses between young and old OVX+E2 rats under any of the three conditions. Inhibition with L-NAME significantly reduced vasodilation in both groups (P<0.05), whereas the combined L-NAME & Indo blockade had no further effect than L-NAME alone. Values are means ± S.E; n = 9–11 animals per group. *Indicates the vasodilator response is significantly different between groups (P<0.05).Ovariectomy eliminated the old age-related difference in PNA vasodilation (Fig. 1B) that was evidenced between young and old intact animals. L-NAME lowered vasodilator responses in PNAs from both young and old OVX rats, indicating that most of the vasodilator response occurred through the NOS signaling mechanism. The combination of L-NAME and Indo abolished all vasodilation in the PNA of OVX animals (Fig. 1B). Ovariectomy with estrogen replacement also showed no age-related difference in vasodilation between young and old rats (Fig. 1C). NOS inhibition lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses in OVX+E2 rats, whereas the addition of the COX inhibitor Indo had little further effect in PNAs from both young and old rats (Fig. 1C). In young rats, the lowering of estrogen levels with OVX lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas estrogen repletion in OVX+E2 rats restored vasodilation to levels equivalent to that in young intact rats (Fig. 2A). In PNAs from old rats, OVX had no effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses (Fig. 3A). The chronic addition of exogenous estrogen elevated vasodilation of PNAs from old rats (Fig. 3A) to levels that were similar to those in young animals (Fig. 1C). Figure 2.

Values are means ± S.E; n = 9–11 animals per group.Trabecular Bone Volume In young rats, the lowering of plasma estrogen concentration through OVX reduced trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) by 43% compared to young intact (Fig. 2B). Estrogen replacement in OVX+E2 rats increased bone volume to levels similar to those in young intact rats (Fig. 2B). OVX in old rats had no effect on trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen resulted in 28% higher trabecular bone volume compared to controls (Fig. 3B).Regression Analyses Trabecular bone volume was significantly correlated to peak vasodilation in both young and old rats (Fig. 2C and 3C) whereby regression analyses indicated R2 values of 0.641 and 0.671 in young and old rats, respectively. In addition, in rats with low estrogen status (i.e., young OVX, old intact and old OVX), there was no relation between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B). However, these groups displayed a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C). Figure 5.

BV/TV was not related to either plasma estrogen (A) or uterine mass (B) in these groups, whereas a significant (P<0.001) linear relation exists between BV/TV and percent PNA vasodilation (C).Discussion The purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral diaphyseal principal nutrient artery, and whether these putative changes in vascular endothelial function are associated with alterations in trabecular bone volume. In young rats, the results demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabecular bone volume in the femur (Fig. 2B), whereas replacement of estrogen following ovariectomy maintains both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume. In old rats, ovariectomy had no effect on circulating estrogen levels, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) or trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen following ovariectomy elevated endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) and increased bone volume (Fig. 3B). The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) and old (Fig. 3C) rats. To our knowledge, these are the first data to report the effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone from young and old animals, and the first to examine the relation between vascular function and bone properties with age and estrogen status as variables. It has long been appreciated that estrogen can have positive effects on the skeletal system. For example, during adolescent growth estrogen is the critical reproductive factor for both girls and boys [31]. Additionally, a fall in estrogen concentration below 30 pg/mL during menopause corresponds to the period of accelerated bone loss [31]. The loss of estrogen following menopause creates an imbalance between bone resorption and formation that leads to a net loss of bone [32]. Many postmenopausal women exhibit reduced bone mass as well as high-turnover bone metabolism, and the reversal of these conditions are observed following estrogen replacement [33]. The preservation of bone mass during this period requires exogenous administration of estrogen sufficient to raise plasma concentrations to 50 pg/mL [31]. Estrogen receptors are present on osteoblasts [34], [35], but the actions of estrogen on these cells and osteoblast-like cells have been variable [4]. A recent study suggests that the mechanism(s) of action of estrogen on bone cell activity is related to the control of function and lifespan of osteoclasts, which serves to ultimately minimize bone resorption [33]. The exact mechanism(s) through which estrogen acts to modulate bone cell activity is not completely understood, allowing for the possibility that non-skeletal tissue may act to modulate bone cell activity [31]. We hypothesize that one such mechanism is related to bone vascular endothelial function and its ability to 1) directly influence bone cell activity through local release of endothelium-derived signaling molecules such as NO and PGI2 [36], [37], and 2) to regulate skeletal perfusion, which could indirectly affect bone cell activity through its impact on fluid filtration out of the vascular compartment and, correspondingly, interstitial fluid pressure in bone [13], [37]–[40]. There is a growing body of literature that supports the notion that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity [40]–[42]. In regard to old age-related bone loss, previous studies in humans and animals have shown compromised bone and marrow blood flow are associated with osteopenia [18]–[22] and studies in male rats have shown impaired bone vascular endothelial function is related to old age-induced bone loss [21], [22]. Additionally, a recent study has reported that a program of low-intensity endurance exercise training that elicits low mechanical strain on bone restores endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation of the PNA and increases trabecular bone volume and mineral density in the distal femur of old male rats [21]. The results demonstrated that old age-induced decrements and training-induced enhancement of NO-mediated vasodilation of the bone vasculature are positively correlated with changes in the bone properties [21], [22]. Results from the present study also demonstrate an association between NO-mediated vasodilation of bone arteries and trabecular bone volume when estrogen status is altered through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement (Fig. 2C and 3C). Although these findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that bone vascular endothelial function is coupled to bone remodeling activity, these results alone are inconclusive since estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity, which could be independent of each other. Therefore, we sought to determine whether a relation exists between vascular endothelial function and bone volume in animals where estrogen concentration was low, i.e., the young OVX and the old intact and OVX groups. Regression analyses indicated that there were no relations (P>0.05) between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B), a biomarker for reproductive hormone status, indicating that the direct effects of estrogen on cancellous bone volume are negligible in these low-estrogen groups. However, there was a significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur. These findings provide support for the concept of a vascular coupling mechanism in bone. This conclusion of a coupling mechanism between the bone vasculature and bone mass is further supported by two studies in humans, where forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness, used as a surrogate measure of bone endothelial function, was positively correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [43], [44]. Thus, in groups without the potentially confounding influence of estrogen, the relation between endothelial function and bone mass is still evident. Intact young and old female rats regulate vasodilation of the femoral PNA primarily through a NOS signaling mechanism and to a lesser extent through a COX signaling pathway (Fig. 1A). These regulatory mechanisms are similar to those of male animals, whereby endothelium-dependent vasodilation is mediated predominantly via the NOS signaling cascade [21], [22]. The old age-associated decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in female rats results from declines in NO-mediated regulation, which is also similar to that observed in male rats. In the absence of estrogen (OVX group), vasodilation in the presence of L-NAME alone is eliminated (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, with estrogen replacement the regulating vasodilator mechanism shifts from the primarily NO signaling pathway to one that includes NO and the putative endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, as indicated by the significant vasodilation that occurs in estrogen replete rats when both NOS and COX signaling pathways are blocked (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the addition of estrogen from an exogenous source does not simply restore the regulatory mechanisms for vasodilation but alters the signaling mechanisms through which the peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the bone resistance vasculature is achieved. A shift in the mechanism of endothelium-dependent vasodilation with OVX has also been reported in mesenteric arteries. In intact rats, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arteries is mediated through both the NOS and COX signaling pathways; OVX diminished the NO-mediated component and augmented the contribution of the COX signaling pathway [45]. The decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with OVX in young rats has also been reported to occur in other vascular beds. For example, OVX has been shown to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of pulmonary arteries [46], the thoracic aorta [46], and coronary resistance arteries [26] in young rats. However, several studies examining the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone arteries of young animals have reported results that are dissimilar to those of the present investigation. In the first study, arterial segments from rabbits were isolated from the metaphyseal cancellous bone and the diaphyseal bone marrow of the femur six weeks after OVX [47]. The vessel segments with a diameter of ∼250 µm were cut into rings and two 40 µm diameter steel wires were passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. Changes in isometric force were measured with increasing concentrations of ACh after the arterial rings were preconstricted with norepinephrine. The results indicated that OVX did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxation [47]. The disparity of results compared to the current study could be due to several factors, including differences in 1) the animal species studied and 2) the techniques employed to study the vascular responses. For instance, unlike rats and humans, rabbits do not undergo the various stages of the estrous cycle [48]. Also, the wire myograph technique used is not ideal for determination of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in small diameter vessels because of the potential for the wires to damage endothelial cells as they are passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. The second study with disparate results relative to those of the current study investigated the effects of OVX in medullary arterioles from the femur of rats using the pressurized vessel technique [49]. Vasodilation induced by ACh was not different between medullary arterioles from intact and OVX rats. The discrepancy in findings may result from differences in the strain of rat studied (Fischer-344 vs. Sprague Dawley), age of the animals at sacrifice (6 and 24 months vs. 3 to 3 ½ months) and, most probably, differences in the period of OVX (2 months vs. 7–10 days). Few studies have examined the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation with advanced age. Castillo et al. [50] reported that relaxation of aortic rings to ACh was reduced in 20-month-old OVX rats. In contrast, OVX had no further effect to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of coronary resistance arteries [26] and femoral PNAs (present study) from old rats. These results indicate that the old age-associated decline in circulating estrogen may contribute to the overall reduction in endothelial cell vasodilator responsiveness that occurs with advancing age [21], [22], [27], [29]. The lack of bone loss with ovariectomy in the aged animals was counterintuitive to anticipated results and other published reports. For example, ovariectomy in rats 18 months of age has shown volume decrements in long bones as well as the vertebrae [51]–[53]. However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports on bone responses to ovariectomy utilizing rats of such an advanced age (i.e., 24 months) as the current investigation. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabecular bone volume (Fig. 2B) in the femur of young, but not in old female rats (Figs. 3A and 3B). Estrogen replacement following ovariectomy maintains and enhances both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume in young and old animals, respectively. The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) and old (Fig. 3C) rats, indicating a possible coupling mechanism between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling activity. Unfortunately, these results alone are inconclusive due to the fact that estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity that are independent of each other. However, in young OVX and old intact and OVX animals, where circulating estrogen levels are low with negligible effects on cancellous bone volume (Figs. 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B), regression analysis demonstrated a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur. These results provide support for a mechanism coupling vascular endothelial vasodilator signaling with bone volume.Funding Statement This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health R01 HL077224, S10-RR023710 (MicroCT equipment grant), Postdoctoral Supplement R36 AG036816, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NNX08AQ62G and NNX09AP06G and the Jane Adams Edmonds Endowed Ph.D. Fellowship from the Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology at the University of Florida.

Keywords: Bone Blood Flow, Hindlimb Unloading, Vascular ResistanceINTRODUCTION The chronic unloading of the skeleton, such as occurs with prolonged bedrest and microgravity, induces a number of alterations to bone, including reductions in bone mass, density, mineralization, trabecular thickness and osteoblastic activity [1–4]. Despite the critical role the microcirculation plays in the maintenance of bone interstitial fluid pressure and flow [5–8], osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cell transport [9, 10], and the putative coupling of bone perfusion and vascular signaling to bone remodeling [6, 9, 11–15], few studies in the literature have examined the effects of chronic unloading on the skeletal vasculature. Fei et al. [17] have reported small vessel rarefaction in the tibia of hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, but the effects of unloading on the bone resistance vasculature, the site of control of bone and marrow perfusion, are unknown. In human models of skeletal unloading, disuse osteopenia occurs at sites where hydrostatic pressure is reduced [7, 18, 19]. Likewise, in patients with unilateral lower limb arterial disease, reductions in blood flow to the affected limb are associated with decrements in femoral bone mineral density [20]. In HU rats, bone loss also occurs in skeletal sites where arterial pressure and perfusion are diminished [1, 6]. Although reductions in both arterial pressure and blood flow have been previously shown to induce vascular remodeling of large conduit arteries [21–24] and resistance arteries in skeletal muscle [25], no studies have examined the impact of altered microvascular hemodynamics on resistance artery structure in bone. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation was to determine, 1) whether vascular remodeling occurs in the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the rat femur during skeletal unloading, 2) whether alterations in PNA circumferential wall stress or intraluminal shear stress are regulated variables when putative changes in vascular structure occur, and 3) whether possible changes in vascular structure are associated with alterations in bone and marrow perfusion with reloading. We hypothesized that the unloading-induced reductions in hindlimb arterial pressure would diminish PNA circumferential wall stress while reductions in blood flow to the femur would reduce PNA intraluminal shear stress. Further, reductions in these mechanical stresses would be normalized through decreases in PNA medial wall thickness and intraluminal diameter, respectively. Additionally, we hypothesized that the shear stress-induced reductions in PNA intraluminal diameter would be associated with a diminished bone hyperemia with skeletal reloading.METHODS Animals All procedures performed in this study were approved by the University of Florida and the Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conformed to the National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011). Six-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 49) were obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX) and individually housed in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 2 °C) room with a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided ad libitum. Animals were randomly assigned to either a normal weight-bearing control (Con) group or 7-d and 14-d hindlimb unloaded (HU) groups. The animals were further subdivided into groups for blood flow (Con, n = 13; 7-d HU, n = 11; 14-d HU, n = 11) and arterial morphology (Con, n = 7; 14-d HU, n = 7) determination. The hindlimbs of the HU groups were elevated to an approximate spinal angle of ~40° via orthopedic traction tape placed around the proximal two-thirds of the tail in a modification of techniques previously described [6, 25, 26]. The height of the hindlimb elevation was adjusted to prevent the hindlimbs from touching supportive surfaces while the forelimbs maintained contact with the cage floor. This configuration allowed free range of movement around the cage while unloading the hindlimb skeleton. HU animals were kept in this position for a period of 7 or 14 d. Control animals were individually maintained in their normal cage environment.Bone Blood Flow Determination Surgical Procedures Control and 7-d and 14-d HU rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg ip). HU rats were anesthetized while remaining in the unloaded position to avoid any weight-bearing activity. A catheter (Dow Corning, Silastic; ID 0.6 mm, OD 1.0 mm) filled with heparinized (200 U/ml) saline was advanced into the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery as previously described [6, 26]. This catheter was subsequently used for the infusion of radiolabeled microspheres to measure blood flow. A second polyurethane catheter (Braintree Scientific, Micro-renathane; ID 0.36mm, OD 0.84 mm), used for the withdrawal of a reference blood sample and measurement of hindlimb arterial pressure, was implanted in the caudal artery of the tail and filled with heparinized saline as previously described [6, 26, 27]. Both catheters were externalized and secured on the dorsal cervical region.Experimental Protocol Following 24 hr of recovery from the surgical procedure, Con and HU animals were instrumented for blood flow determination. Blood flow in the Con group was first measured while the animals were hindlimb unloaded by elevating their hindlimbs to an approximate spinal angle of ~40° for 10 min. The animals were then returned to a normal standing position for 10 min and a second blood flow measure was made using different radiolabeled microspheres. In the HU groups, blood flow was first measured while the animals were in the unloaded position. The rats’ hindlimbs were then lowered to a weight-bearing standing position and blood flow was again measured following 10 min of standing. After the microsphere infusions, euthanasia solution (0.4 ml/kg; Euthanasia-5 Solution, Henry Schein Inc.) was infused through the carotid catheter. Femora and soleus muscles were removed from the carcass. The soleus muscle was weighed to determine the efficacy of the unloading treatment. Femora from both hindlimbs were sectioned into three regions, the proximal and distal metaphyses and diaphysis; the femoral marrow was removed from the diaphysis and counted as a fourth region as previously described [6, 12, 15]. Corresponding femoral sections from the left and right hindlimbs were combined for each animal to ensure sufficient microspheres in the samples. Bone samples were weighed and placed in counting vials for flow determination. Mass of the femoral marrow was determined by weighing the shaft before and after the marrow was removed.Blood Flow and Vascular Resistance Radiolabeled (85Sr, 113Sn, and 46Sc) microspheres (Perkin Elmer) with a 15 μm diameter were used for blood flow measurements as previously described [6, 12, 15, 26]. The 15 μm diameter of the microspheres results in the spheres being trapped in small arterial vessels upstream of capillaries, and therefore reflects flow through the arteries. Radioactivity of the samples was measured with a gamma counter (Packard AutoGamma 5780) and flows were computed (PC-GERDA V2.9 Software) from counts per minute and tissue wet weights. Vascular resistance was calculated by dividing arterial pressure by tissue blood flow.Central Hemodynamics Electronically averaged mean arterial pressure and heart rate (pulse pressure rate) were recorded from the caudal catheter immediately before and after each microsphere infusion and averaged.Arterial Morphology Determination Microvessel Preparation At the end of the experimental period, Con and 14-d HU rats were injected with euthanasia solution (0.5 ml/kg ip; Euthanasia-5 Solution, Henry Schein Inc.). The hindlimbs were removed from the carcass and placed in a 4°C filtered physiological saline buffer solution (PSS). Using a stereomicroscope, the femoral PNA was identified. In the area where the PNA entered the femoral diaphysis, muscle fibers surrounding the bone and PNA were carefully dissected away (Fig 1). The femoral diaphysis was then cut adjacent to the nutrient foramen and canal using a small bone saw, taking care not to penetrate the canal with the saw blade. The femur was then carefully broken along the cuts and the length of the PNA from the periosteal surface into the marrow was isolated and transferred to a Lucite vessel chamber containing PSS. One end of the PNA was cannulated with a glass micropipette filled with filtered PSS solution and tied securely to the pipette with 11-0 ophthalmic suture (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). The other end of the vessel was cannulated with a second micropipette and secured with suture as previously described [12, 15, 16]. Intraluminal pressure in the isolated PNA was set at 44 mmHg (60 cmH2O) with two hydrostatic pressure reservoirs. This intravascular pressure was selected based on previously reported intravascular pressures of 43 ± 1.8 mmHg and 46 ± 2.6 mmHg in skeletal muscle resistance arteries of similar size to the PNA in normotensive rats [28]. The distance between the cannulating micropipettes was adjusted so that the PNA axial length was straight but not stretched. The vessel chamber and pressure lines were then filled with calcium-free PSS containing 2.0 mM EDTA. PNAs were rinsed every 15 min during a 60 min period to facilitate complete relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cells. During the last 15-min period, the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (10−4 M) was added to the vessel chamber to ensure complete relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were first determined at the end of this second 15-min incubation using videomicroscopic techniques [29–31]. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were taken as the mean of three separate measurements from positions randomly selected along the PNA length. To measure medial wall thickness, the video caliper was positioned on the outer and inner surface of the medial layer of the vessel. The focal plane was adjusted through the medial wall and the smallest distance between the inner and outer surface was taken to be medial wall thickness. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Photomicrograph of the rat principal nutrient artery and the diaphyseal nutrient foramen of the right femur.Histomorphometry Following determination of maximal diameter and medial wall thickness using videomicroscopy, the cannulated and pressurized arteries were then fixed with a 4% formaldehyde buffer solution, stained with eosin, and embedded in paraffin as previously described [25, 32]. From the paraffin-embedded vessels, 7 μm thick cross-sections were cut, mounted on glass microscope slides and stained with eosin hematoxylin and picrosirius red. Vascular structure was evaluated by measuring vessel media layer cross-sectional area (CSA), inner media perimeter, and media wall thickness. Media wall thickness was measured at six points separated by 60-degree angles and averaged. Vessel radius or diameter was calculated from the inner media perimeter measure. All measurements were made using an image processing and shape analysis system (BioQuant TrueColor Windows, Version 2.0, R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) as previously described [25, 32].Shear Stress and Circumferential Wall Stress Determination Shear Stress The shear stress (τ) at the inner surface of the PNA was calculated as: τ=4ηQ/πri3 where η is the blood viscosity (0.035 Poise) [33], Q is the blood flow rate (ml/min) to the femoral diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow, and intraluminal radius (ri) of the PNA was calculated from the measured media inner perimeter [25, 34]. Q was designated as the blood flow rate to the femoral diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow because perfusion of these regions occurs via the PNA in adult rats, whereas the proximal and distal metaphyseal regions are perfused via the epiphyseal and metaphyseal nutrient arteries, respectively [9, 35]. PNA wall shear stress was calculated for three conditions: 1) a control condition using control standing Q and control PNA ri, 2) an unloading condition using unloaded Q and control PNA ri to assess shear stress in control PNAs with unloading-induced decrements in flow, and 3) an unloaded condition using Q measures in unloaded femora and PNA ri from unloaded rats to assess whether vascular remodeling serves to normalize shear stress during unloading.Circumferential Stress The circumferential wall stress (σ) of the PNA was calculated as: σ=Pari/WT where Pa is the arterial pressure and WT is the medial wall thickness [24, 32]. Pa was measured at the level of the PNA through the caudal artery tail catheter while maintaining the pressure transducer at the approximate level of the PNA. Like that of shear stress, circumferential stress was calculated for 1) a control condition using control standing Pa and control PNA ri and WT measures, 2) an unloading condition using unloaded Pa and control PNA ri and WT measures to assess circumferential wall stress in a control PNA when unloading has diminished hindlimb arterial pressure, and 3) an unloaded condition using both Pa and PNA dimensions from unloaded rats to assess whether vascular remodeling serves to normalize circumferential wall stress during unloading.Data Analysis A one-way ANOVA was used to compare body and tissue masses and PNA structure and mechanical stresses across conditions. Student-Newman-Keuls method was used as a post hoc test to determine the significances of differences among means. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs with pairwise comparisons were used to determine the significance of differences in tissue blood flow, vascular resistance and central hemodynamics within (unloaded vs. standing) and among (Con vs. 7-d HU vs. 14-d HU) factors. All values are presented as the mean ± SE. A P<0.05 was required for significance.RESULTS Body and Soleus Muscle Mass Body mass was not different among Con (439 ± 11 g), 7-d HU (425 ± 12 g) and 14-d HU (418 ± 10 g) rats. Soleus muscle mass of 7-d HU (198 ± 13 mg) and 14-d HU (187 ± 8 mg) rats was lower than that of Con animals (269 ± 30 mg). Soleus muscle atrophy in HU rats is characteristic of reduced skeletal muscle weight-bearing activity and confirms the effectiveness of the hindlimb unloading treatment.Central Hemodynamics In Con rats, heart rate following 10-min of unloading was higher than that in 7- and 14-d HU rats during the unloaded condition (Table 1). When the animals were reloaded, heart rate was higher in the 7-d HU (451 ± 12 beats/min) and 14-d HU (454 ± 10 beats/min) groups relative to that in the Con rats (427 ± 9 beats/min) during standing. Mean caudal tail arterial pressure was not different between Con and 7-d HU rats during unloading, but it was higher in both groups relative to that in 14-d HU rats (Table 1). During reloading, mean caudal tail artery pressure did not differ among groups (Con, 130 ± 4 mmHg; 7-d HU, 127 ± 4 mmHg; 14-d HU, 128 ± 3 mmHg). Table 1.

Skeletal Blood Flow and Vascular Resistance During unloading, femoral bone and marrow blood flow (Table 1) and vascular resistance did not differ among the three groups. With reloading, blood flow increased in the proximal metaphysis, diaphyseal marrow and distal metaphysis of Con rats, but only increased in the diaphyseal marrow of 7- and 14-d HU rats. During standing, blood flow in 14-d HU rats was lower in all four of the regions of the femur relative to that in Con rats (Fig 2). Likewise, vascular resistance in all regions of the femur was higher in 14-d HU rats during reloading (Fig 3). Figure 2.

Using videomicroscopy, maximal intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (146 ± 7 μm) was smaller than that from Con rats (177 ± 10 μm). Likewise, PNA medial wall thickness in 14-d HU rats (16 ± 2 μm) was thinner than that from Con animals (22 ± 2 μm). Results derived using histomorphometric techniques were similar to those obtained with videomicroscopy. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats was 15% smaller than that from Con rats and medial wall thickness was 21% thinner in 14-d HU rats (Table 2). The smaller diameters and thinner medial walls resulted in a 23% smaller medial cross-sectional area in PNAs from 14-d HU animals (Table 2). Figure 4.

PNA Shear Stress and Circumferential Stress Unloading-induced reductions in blood flow to the femoral diaphysis and marrow resulted in a lower calculated shear stress in the femoral PNA (Fig 5A). However, the remodeling of the PNA to reduce luminal diameter in HU rats (Fig 4) resulted in a similar PNA shear stress in the unloaded condition to that in Con rat PNAs under the control standing condition (Fig 5A). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Calculated shear stress (A) and circumferential wall stress (B) in femoral principal nutrient arteries (PNA) of control and hindlimb unloaded (HU) animals during standing. *Mean is different from control standing condition (P< 0.05).The lower arterial pressure in the hindlimb of HU rats during unloading (Table 1) resulted in a lower calculated PNA circumferential wall stress (Fig 5B). This diminished circumferential wall stress was normalized to Con levels through the unloading-induced PNA remodeling to reduce medial wall thickness (Fig 5B).DISCUSSION Previous work has shown that as little as 10 min of skeletal unloading reduces bone and marrow perfusion of long bones [6)]. Given that chronic changes in local hemodynamic conditions (e.g., blood flow and arterial pressure) can induce vascular remodeling and impact tissue blood flow capacity [23–25], the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether 7-d and 14-d of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular resistance during reloading, and to investigate whether putative changes in bone blood flow during reloading are associated with a structural remodeling of the femoral PNA. Results from the present study provide the first evidence that chronic skeletal disuse decreases the bone and marrow hyperemia (Fig 2) and elevates bone vascular resistance (Fig 3) during reloading, as well as induces a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature. The remodeling of bone resistance arteries (Fig 4) appears to be driven by alterations in mechanical forces within the arterial vasculature that were induced during the unloading treatment, including decreases in blood flow (shear stress, Fig 5A) and hindlimb arterial pressure (circumferential wall stress, Fig 5B). Further, the vascular remodeling served to normalize intraluminal shear stress and circumferential wall stress to levels equivalent to that in control standing rats. While gross structural remodeling of bone resistance arteries occurs to maintain a type of mechanical homeostasis within the artery during unloading (Fig 5), these changes in arterial structure may have adverse consequences with reloading. For example, the structural narrowing of the resistance vasculature could function to limit bone and marrow blood flow capacity and contribute to the elevations in vascular resistance during reloading. Previous studies have also provided evidence that vascular remodeling occurs within bone during prolonged disuse. For example, Doty et al. [36] reported that the vascular space (area) in the diaphyseal region of the tibia in rats flown 12.5 days in space on a Cosmos biosatellite tended to be lower than that in ground control animals. The lack of statistical significance was attributed to the low number of animals studied (n = 5 per group). Fei et al. (17) have also demonstrated small vessel rarefaction in the tibial metaphysis of 21-d HU rats using a technique to quantify microvascular network structure that does not differentiate between arteries, veins and capillaries or include larger microvessels of the size of resistance arteries [37]. And using sciatic neurectomy to generate unilateral disuse in the rat hindlimb, Matsumoto et al. [38] investigated disuse effects on the pervasive canal network in cortical bone of the tibia during growth. This canal network provides the infrastructure for vascular distribution throughout bone. Fourteen wks of disuse decreased canal number and density, as well as diminishing periosteal and endocortical bone formation. The authors speculated that the less dense canal network would be accompanied by a lower perfusion rate [38], which could adversely affect the fluid pressure gradient and fluid flow between the endosteal vasculature and periosteal lympathics [39, 40]. An active transmural pressure gradient and fluid flow is rudimentary to the bone formation process [8]. Collectively, these studies suggest several types of unloading-induced vascular adaptations in bone: 1) a narrowing of bone resistance arteries [present study], which could negatively impact the bulk flow of oxygen and nutrients into bone, cellular transport, and ultimately the bulk fluid flow through capillaries into the interstitial spaces [9, 10, 35], and 2) rarefaction of the bone microvascular network and supporting infrastructure [17, 36, 38], which among other things could impair potential signaling between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling units [11, 14–16]. The consequences of insufficient perfusion of bone and marrow during loading could be severe. Ischemic bone is susceptible to several deleterious effects, including loss of osteocytes [41] and diminished osteoblast activity [42]. Interestingly, osteoclast activity is seemingly unperturbed by similar decrements in blood supply [42]. McCarthy [43] has suggested that hypoxia produced by inadequate blood flow would be accompanied by slight decreases in pH, which could serve to stimulate osteoclast activity. Bone marrow ischemia is also a precursor to osteonecrosis [44]. Although there is no evidence that unloading-induced decrements in blood flow during reloading are severe enough to provoke osteonecrosis, an underperfusion of bone and marrow could have adverse effects on bone structure and health, particularly if the energetic requirements of metabolically active bone cells exceed the capacity of the vasculature to provide sufficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, under such low-flow conditions there may be a diminished influence of systemic factors on bone tissue and a concomitant increase in the dependency and influence of local factors in bone. The classic theory of vascular remodeling holds that it is stimulated by local hypoxemia [45, 46]. While still an important factor, hypoxia may not be the direct impetus for alterations in vascular structure. Rather, it appears that arteries respond to changes in mechanical stress and strain by remodeling their gross structural properties in order to maintain a type of mechanical homeostasis [23]. In conduit arteries, for example, structure is maintained by “normal” blood flow (shear stress) and “normal” arterial pressure (circumferential wall stress) [23, 46]. Deviations from this hemodynamic status quo are critical mechanisms to induce vascular remodeling [45, 46]. For instance, research on large conduit arteries reveals that decreases in blood flow through the artery reduces wall shear stress, and this induces a remodeling that diminishes luminal diameter and correspondingly serves to normalize wall shear stress [22]. Likewise, hypertension increases the circumferential wall stress of arteries and elicits an adaptive thickening of the media layer of the arterial wall that consequently serves to lower circumferential wall stress [23]. Much of what is known regarding the mechanisms that induce vascular remodeling has come from studies of conduit arteries exposed to increases and decreases in blood flow or increases in arterial pressure [23, 24, 45, 46]. Large conduit arteries, however, are not subjected to the same physical or chemical environment (e.g., altered tissue oxygenation and local pH) of small resistance arteries within tissue. Only a relatively small number of studies have investigated the remodeling of resistance arteries and few of these contain measures necessary to determine changes in resistance artery shear stress or circumferential wall stress. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the effects of changes in the hydrodynamic mechanical environment on the bone vasculature. Although the bone vasculature is unique in many ways [9, 10, 35, 43, 44], the results demonstrate that bone resistance arteries also remodel to maintain a mechanical homeostasis during conditions of prolonged disuse and unloading (Fig 5A & 5B). The structural modification of the femoral PNA to decrease wall thickness in response to chronic reductions in hindlimb arterial pressure could make the vessels more susceptible to degeneration or disruption of the vascular wall, as was observed to occur in the tibia of spaceflown rats following 2-d of reloading [36]. Likewise, the narrowing of the PNA maximal intraluminal diameter in response to the chronic unloading-induced decreases in blood flow could impose a structural limitation on oxygen and nutrient delivery to the bone and marrow upon return to weight bearing activity. In conclusion, results from the present study confirm previous observations [6] that skeletal unloading decreases long bone blood flow (Table 1). The results further demonstrate that this prolonged skeletal disuse impairs the ability of the vasculature to augment bone and marrow blood flow upon reloading (Fig 2). The diminished hyperemic response is the result of elevations in vascular resistance within the bone and marrow (Fig 3) and is associated with a remodeling of the resistance vasculature (Fig 4). This arterial remodeling served to maintain shear stress (Fig 5A) and circumferential wall stress (Fig 5B) through decreases in maximal diameter and medial wall thickness, respectively, in the face of a diminished blood flow and hindlimb arterial pressure. The functional consequences of the structural narrowing of resistance arteries in particular could serve to limit bone and marrow blood flow capacity and possibly contribute to bone ischemia during reloading or physical activity.Highlights. Chronic skeletal unloading decreases bone and marrow blood flow (BF) to the femur Reloading results in a lower bone and marrow BF and higher vascular resistance (VR) The lower BF is associated with vascular remodeling in the femur The vascular remodeling is driven by alterations in intravascular mechanical forces This remodeling also limits bone BF capacity and elevates VR during reloading Acknowledgments This study was supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Grant NNX12AL41G.Footnotes Publisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

    "abstract": "Abstract Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values.

Copyright © 2013 the American Physiological Society  Copyright notice ID: 3615599 PMID: 23349454 Abstract Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min−1·100−1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min−1·100−1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise. Keywords: aging, adipose tissue, blood flow, α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, exercise by the year 2030, individuals, 85 years and older, will constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United States (1), and aging is associated with a decline in maximal exercise capacity (23, 41, 55, 57, 59, 72), which may contribute to the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle. During the transition from rest to exercise, a rapid redistribution of peripheral blood flow is essential to maintain central venous return and the instantaneous elevation of cardiac output (30), as well as augment oxygen (O2) delivery to the active musculature to match the immediate increase (≤2 s) in O2 consumption (7). However, during exercise (52), heat stress (38), and orthostatic challenges (61), whole-body hemodynamics (i.e., cardiac output distribution and perturbations in arterial pressure) are altered in old vs. young subjects. In particular, during exercise, old age-associated alterations in muscle blood flow (10, 21, 46, 77) result in a mismatching of O2 delivery to O2 consumption (9, 14, 22), which would expectedly contribute to an age-related functional decline. Whether aging affects the distribution of blood flow to other tissues, such as adipose tissue (AT), during exercise remains to be determined. We have demonstrated recently that arterial pressure in old rats decreases during an orthostatic challenge, which was associated with an inability to elevate vascular resistance in white AT (61). Furthermore, there was a severely diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries with old age (61). Given that AT makes up a greater proportion of body composition with aging in rats (18) and humans (11), a reduced vasoconstriction of resistance vessels from this tissue could have significant ramifications on the ability to regulate AT blood flow in aged individuals to maintain arterial pressure and muscle blood flow during exercise (19). The primary role of white AT is the storage and mobilization of lipids. However, white AT is also regarded as an endocrine organ (27), as white adipocytes produce mediators that influence metabolism of lipids and glucose and immune responses (73, 74). Regulation of AT blood flow is complex and largely influenced by pathologies {e.g., type II diabetes and insulin resistance (28, 36), body composition [obesity (71)], nutritional state [fasting vs. postprandial (70)], and the anatomical location of AT [e.g., central vs. peripheral; for review, see Sotornik et al. (64)]}. Although white AT lacks significant parasympathetic innervation (29), there is substantial neuroanatomical and neurochemical evidence of a differential sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation depending on anatomical location [for review, see Bartness and Bamshad (5)]. Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating white AT results in a vasoconstriction that is abolished by the α-adrenergic receptor blockade (54), suggesting that the regulation of AT blood flow is influenced largely by the SNS. During short-duration exercise (<30 min) in young, healthy subjects, there is an immediate decrease in blood flow to the viscera (2), as well as subcutaneous and epididymal AT (45), likely consequent to activation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons. The reduction of blood flow to these tissues during exercise contributes, in part, to the effective redistribution of cardiac output to maximize perfusion of the active musculature and maintenance of systemic vascular resistance (2, 19). However, given the old age-associated diminution of α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from white AT (61), it is likely that AT blood flow will either remain similar to resting values or possibly be elevated during the transition from rest to exercise with old age. As AT receives a large proportion of cardiac output (∼8–12%) under normal resting conditions (18), old age-associated alterations in AT blood flow could have significant consequences on the ability to redirect blood flow to active tissue during physical activity in the elderly population. However, the effects of aging and exercise on AT blood flow are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that with old age, 1) there is an inability to modulate AT blood flow during short-duration dynamic exercise, and 2) the altered adipose blood flow response with old age will be associated with a diminished α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from AT. Given the ability of exercise training to enhance adrenergic vasoconstriction in muscle that is not actively recruited during exercise (43), as well as myogenic vasoconstriction (50), the second part of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training can 1) mitigate putative alterations in AT perfusion during exercise and 2) improve α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction in adipose-resistance arteries. METHODS All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University and the University of Florida. All methods complied fully with the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, revised 1996. Male Fischer 344 rats were obtained at ages 4–5 mo and 22 mo and studied at 6 mo and 24 mo to represent young (n = 40) and old (n = 28) animals, respectively. The rats were housed individually at 23°C, maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle, and provided rat chow and water ad libitum. This strain was chosen because cardiovascular function decreases with age in these rats without the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis (42). Endurance exercise training. Young and old rats were assigned randomly to a sedentary (Sed) control group [young (YSed), n = 21; old (OSed), n = 13] or an exercise-trained (ET) group [young (YET), n = 19; old (OET), n = 15]. ET rats were habituated to treadmill exercise, during which each rat walked on a motor-driven treadmill at 15 m/min (0° incline), 5 min/day for 3 days. After the habituation period, the incline was raised to 15° for the duration of the training period, whereas the 15 m/min speed was maintained. During the first 5 wk of training, the time of exercise was increased by 10 min/wk, until 60-min duration was reached by the 6th wk. The ET rats continued to exercise 5 days/wk for 60 min/day for the remainder of the 10- to 12-wk training period. As discussed by Musch et al. (52), this training intensity [i.e., percent of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max)] would correspond to ∼60–70% in young rats and ∼70–80% in old rats of their respective VO2max.Study 1: AT blood flow at rest and during exercise. Blood flow at rest and during exercise to the intra-abdominal AT was determined in YSed (n = 13), YET (n = 8), OSed (n = 7), and OET (n = 5) animals using the radionuclide-tagged microsphere technique, as described previously (16, 33, 44). Prior to the surgical procedure, Sed animals were familiarized with treadmill running. During the familiarization period (<2 wk), animals exercised for 10 min/day at a speed of 15 m/min at a 15° incline, two to three times/wk. At least 24 h after the last exercise bout, during the familiarization or training period, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–2.5%/O2 balance), and a catheter [Silastic; Dow Corning, Midland, MI; inside diameter (ID) 0.6 mm; outside diameter (OD) 1.0 mm] filled with heparinized saline solution (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ; 100 U/mL) was advanced into the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery. This catheter was used for infusion of radiolabeled microspheres for tissue blood flow measurements and for monitoring mean arterial pressure. The carotid catheter was externalized dorsally and secured to the skin. A second polyurethane catheter (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA; ID 0.36 mm; OD 0.84 mm) was implanted in the caudal tail artery and externalized at the tail. This catheter was used to obtain a reference blood sample, which serves as an artificial organ for calculating tissue flows. All surgical procedures, beginning with the initiation and ending with the withdrawal of anesthesia, lasted ≤30 min. After the closure of incisions, the animals were given ≥4 h to recover, as previous studies (24) have demonstrated that circulatory dynamics, regional blood flow, arterial blood gases, and acid-base status are stable in the awake rat, 1–6 h after gas anesthesia. After the recovery period, the rat was placed on the treadmill, and the tail artery catheter was connected to a 1-ml plastic syringe that was connected to a Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) infusion/withdrawal pump (model 907), and the carotid artery catheter was connected to a blood-pressure transducer (MLT844; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Exercise was initiated (15 m/min) at a 0° incline to assure that all animals ran continuously during the testing period without changing gait patterns (e.g., stop and start running on the treadmill). After 4 min of total exercise time, blood withdrawal from the caudal artery (0.25 ml/min) began. The right carotid artery catheter was disconnected from the pressure transducer, and a distinct radiolabeled (46Sc, 113Sn, 57Co, or 85Sr) microsphere (15-μm diameter; DuPont/NEN, Boston, MA) was infused (∼2.5 × 105 in number) in random order into the ascending aorta and flushed with warmed saline to assure clearance of the beads. Blood withdrawal from the caudal artery continued for 45 s after microsphere infusion. After a 30-min recovery period, a second microsphere infusion was performed in conscious, standing animals following the same procedures as described above. This infusion strategy was used to minimize the pre-exercise, anticipatory response (3) and facilitates an accurate “resting” measurement. Following the microsphere infusion, animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (>100 mg/kg ip). The intra-abdominal adipose pad—defined as the fat that lines the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity, separate from the visceral organs, and lies bilaterally along the vertebral column, extending caudally from the diaphragm to the pelvis—and kidneys were removed. The radioactivity level of the tissues was then determined by a gamma-scintillation counter (Cobra II auto-gamma counter; Packard, Downers Grove, IL) set to record the peak energy activity of each isotope for 5 min. AT blood flow was calculated by the reference sample method (33, 44) and expressed in ml·min−1·100−1 g of tissue. To account for possible changes in perfusion, due to alterations in arterial pressure, vascular conductance was calculated (i.e., blood flow/mean arterial pressure) and expressed in ml·min−1·100−1 g of tissue/mmHg. Data were only analyzed and reported for animals that displayed adequate mixing of the microspheres, as verified by a <20% difference in blood flow between the right and left kidney.Study 2: adipose microvessel vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Microvessel studies from the intra-abdominal white AT were performed in a separate group of YSed (n = 8), YET (n = 11), OSed (n = 6), and OET (n = 10) animals, according to the methods of Ramsey et al. (61). After euthanasia (sodium pentobarbital >100 mg/kg ip), the intra-abdominal adipose pad was carefully dissected free and placed in a 4°C filtered physiological saline solution (PSS) buffer (in mM: 147 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO2, 1.17 MgSO4, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, and 3.0 MOPS; pH 7.4). Resistance arteries (<300 μm maximal luminal diameter) were isolated with the aid of a stereomicroscope (Olympus SVH10). Subsequently, both ends of the artery were cannulated with glass micropipettes filled with the filtered PSS and secured to the pipettes with 11-0 ophthalmic suture (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX). After cannulation, each vessel in the tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70), coupled to a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP310) and video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO). Intraluminal pressure in the isolated artery was set at 75 cmH2O (61). Vessels that exhibited leaks were discarded. Vessels free of leaks equilibrated for at least 1 h at 37°C, with the bathing solution replaced every 20 min during this period, and were allowed to develop spontaneous tone. To determine vasoconstrictor responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) and phenylephrine (PE), cumulative additions of each drug (10−9 to 10−4 M) were performed (15). Following assessment of vasoconstrictor responses, the vessels were incubated in Ca2+-free PSS containing 100 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine maximal passive lumen diameter. In a separate group of abdominal AT arteries, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were determined by increasing the intraluminal pressure from 0 to 135 cmH2O in 15-cmH2O increments. The diameter was recorded continuously for 5 min with each pressure change (51). The passive pressure–diameter relation was then determined after the vessels were incubated at 37°C for 60 min in Ca2+-free PSS containing 100 μM SNP, with the bathing solution changed every 20 min. The same protocol, as described for the active myogenic response, was used to determine passive artery characteristics.Muscle oxidative enzyme activity. Citrate synthase, a mitochondrial enzyme and marker of muscle oxidative potential, was measured in duplicate from soleus muscle homogenates, according to the method of Srere (65). Citrate synthase activity, expressed as μmol·min−1·g−1 wet weight, was measured spectrophotometrically using a SpectraMax M5 microplate (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in 300-μl aliquots at 30°C to determine the efficacy of the training protocol.Data presentation. The development of spontaneous tone was expressed as the percent vasoconstriction relative to the maximal intraluminal diameter measured according to spontaneous tone(%)=(IDmax−IDb)/IDmax×100 where IDmax is the maximal passive intraluminal diameter recorded at a pressure of 75 cmH2O, and IDb is the steady-state baseline diameter. Vasoconstrictor responses to NE and PE were expressed as the percent change from baseline diameter according to vasoconstriction(%)=(IDb−IDss)/IDb×100 where IDb is the initial diameter recorded before the addition of the vasoconstrictor, and IDss is the steady-state diameter measured after each dose of the drug. Active myogenic responses after sequential intraluminal pressure changes were normalized according to normalized diameter=(IDss−ID75) where IDss is the steady-state diameter measured after each step change in intraluminal pressure, and ID75 is the diameter measured at 75 cmH2O during the passive pressure response, which reflects the maximal diameter for vessels in which active and passive pressure responses were determined.Statistical analysis. Dose-response curves were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures to detect differences between (experimental groups) and within (concentration or pressure) factors. Post hoc analyses were performed using Duncan's multiple range test. Vascular sensitivity, the concentration of NE or PE exhibiting EC50, was determined by logarithmic curve-fitting equations. A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the significance of differences among groups in vessel characteristics, body masses, and citrate synthase activity. All values are presented as means ± SE. P ≤ 0.05 was required for significance.RESULTS Body mass, mean arterial pressure, and citrate synthase activity. Body mass and mean arterial pressure at rest and during exercise are described in Table 1. The efficacy of the training program was confirmed with a significant increase in citrate synthase activity of the soleus in both young (YSed, 15 ± 2 μmol·g−1·min−1; YET, 20 ± 2 μmol·g−1·min−1; P < 0.05) and old (OSed, 14 ± 2 μmol·g−1·min−1; OET, 19 ± 2 μmol·g−1·min−1; P < 0.05) groups.

Intra-abdominal AT blood flow and vascular conductance at rest and during exercise. In the sedentary animals at rest, there was lower AT blood flow in the old group vs. younger counterparts (Fig. 1A). Exercise training significantly elevated adipose perfusion at rest in both age groups and abolished age-related differences in resting flow (Fig. 1A). Vascular conductance measured at rest paralleled blood flow measures in all groups (Fig. 1B). During the steady state of exercise, there was a significantly higher AT blood flow in OSed vs. YSed (Fig. 2A). Exercise training resulted in an elevated adipose perfusion during exercise to YET and a reduced flow to OET vs. sedentary counterparts (Fig. 2A); age-related differences in adipose blood flow were no longer present. Despite small differences in arterial pressure among groups during exercise (Table 1), vascular conductance measures paralleled those of blood flow among groups (Fig. 2B). When comparing vascular conductance responses during the transition from rest to exercise, all groups showed significant differences, albeit there was a directionally opposite response in the OSed vs. YSed groups. Specifically, compared with resting values, there was an ∼55% decrease in vascular conductance in YSed and an ∼110% increase in vascular conductance in OSed during exercise (Fig. 3). After exercise training, both OET and YET demonstrated a similar decrease (∼50%) in vascular conductance from rest to exercise, and age-related differences were abolished (Fig. 3). Fig. 1.

The maximal diameter and spontaneous tone of resistance arteries from intra-abdominal AT are listed in Table 1. Compared with YSed, there was a tendency for a greater maximal diameter and significantly less tone in intra-abdominal AT arteries from the OSed group. After exercise training, there were no differences in maximal diameter or spontaneous tone between age groups (Table 1). Tone was significantly greater in OET vs. OSed.Vasoconstrictor responses. NE elicited a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries from all groups (Fig. 4A). The constriction evoked by NE was significantly lower in OSed vs. YSed, and exercise training resulted in a significantly greater contractile response to NE in OET vs. OSed (Fig. 4A). There was a greater vasoconstriction after exercise training, only at the highest concentration (10−4 M) in YET (59 ± 4%) vs. YSed (45 ± 4%, P < 0.05) and OET (46 ± 6%, P < 0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to NE in OSed vs. YSed (Table 1). There were no differences in sensitivity to NE between YET and OET, although there was an enhanced sensitivity in OET vs. OSed (Table 1). PE produced similar concentration-dependent, contractile responses in AT-resistance arteries from all groups (Fig. 4B). Vasoconstrictor responses to PE were diminished in OSed vs. YSed, and exercise training enhanced contractile responses to PE in the old group but did not significantly affect that of the young group (Fig. 4B) vs. age-matched sedentary counterparts. Although there were no group response differences to PE between YET and OET, the constriction elicited by 10−5 and 10−4 M PE was greater in the YET (55 ± 4 and 64 ± 5%, respectively) vs. OET (44 ± 4 and 49 ± 5%, respectively; P < 0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to PE in OSed vs. YSed (Table 1). Exercise training did not affect sensitivity to PE in the young group but enhanced sensitivity significantly in OET vs. OSed (Table 1). There were no differences in sensitivity to PE between the trained groups (Table 1). Fig. 4.

Values are mean ± SE. *P < 0.05 among groups.Myogenic responses. In the sedentary group, at all pressures above zero, the active diameter was significantly larger in arteries from OSed vs. YSed (Fig. 5). Exercise training abolished age-related differences in the active myogenic response among groups (Fig. 5A). There were no differences in the passive pressure–diameter response among groups (Fig. 5B).

Active responses were determined in the presence of 2 mM extracellular Ca2+. Passive responses were determined in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Values are mean ± SE. *P < 0.05 of active responses among groups. There were no differences in the passive response among groups.DISCUSSION The overall purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that old age-related vascular dysfunction in AT would adversely affect the ability to redistribute blood flow away from AT during exercise. In support of our hypothesis, there was an increase in AT blood flow and vascular conductance during exercise in old rats, whereas there was a decrease in AT blood flow and vascular conductance in young, healthy controls (Figs. 2 and 3). To investigate potential mechanisms for this disparate blood flow response to AT during exercise, we measured AT-resistance artery contractile responses to α-adrenergic and myogenic stimuli, both of which were found to be diminished in the OSed vs. YSed group (Figs. 4 and 5). After chronic aerobic training, the directional change and magnitude of AT perfusion and vascular conductance from rest to exercise were similar between young and old groups (Figs. 1–3). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in both intra-abdominal AT arterial α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction with old age after exercise training. It is likely that the inability to rapidly divert blood flow away from AT with old age contributes to reductions in arterial pressure during orthostatic challenges (61) and heat stress (38), as well as altered whole-body hemodynamics during physical activity (39). However, after exercise training, many of the old, age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vasoconstrictor responses in adipose-resistance arteries were abolished. This suggests that an enhanced ability to centrally mobilize blood volume from AT after chronic training may be a contributing mechanism to the enhanced muscle blood flow during exercise (6) and the increased ability to tolerate orthostatic challenges (49) in older individuals. Regulation of AT blood flow. AT blood flow is intricately linked to metabolism for adequate substrate and humoral delivery (64) and is tightly regulated through autonomic and endocrine signaling, as well as intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms of AT-resistance vessels (75). Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating inguinal white AT elicits a robust vasoconstriction that is abolished by α-adrenergic receptor blockade (54), suggesting an immediate decrease in AT vascular conductance with enhanced SNS activity. However, AT vascular responses to systemic intravenous infusion of NE produce conflicting results that appear to be time dependent. For example, experiments that elevate systemic NE concentrations in humans (all of which result in elevated arterial pressure) demonstrate a decreased (32) or increased (40) vascular conductance and augmented blood flow (60) in subcutaneous AT. In the latter two studies, it should be noted that despite plasma NE concentrations reaching a steady state within 5–10 min, significant changes in AT blood flow did not occur until 15–30 min after NE infusion began, thus suggesting that a prolonged exposure is required to elicit changes in vascular conductance. In the current study, we observe a robust vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from centrally located intra-abdominal AT in the young group to both NE and PE (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively), which is in contrast to some human data showing an increased AT vascular conductance to systemically elevated NE levels (40). The reasons for the disparate findings between the isolated vessel rapid contraction to NE and studies showing an increased adipose perfusion to elevated systemic NE over longer time frames (60) are unknown but may be related to tissue-specific vascular properties (peripheral vs. central) or the large elevation in arterial pressure with systemic NE infusion (40, 60) concomitant with the loss of myogenic autoregulation at higher transmural pressures in AT-resistance vessels (75). The effect of exercise on AT blood flow appears to be dependent largely on the duration of exercise. In the current study, there was a reduction in blood flow (Fig. 2A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 3) when transitioning from rest to exercise in young, healthy subjects, due, in part, to an active vasoconstriction in AT. This observation is consistent with other studies that demonstrate an immediate (≤5 min) decrease in perfusion of epididymal (45) adipose depots and subcutaneous fat [(45), and see Armstrong et al. (2) for exception] during dynamic whole-body exercise. However, with longer durations of exercise, blood flow to AT increases, likely consequent to an increased delivery of free fatty acids from AT (25), suggesting that any initial vasoconstriction during exercise onset is modified later by circulating humoral or endocrine factors (25) and possibly tachyphylaxia of adrenergic receptors (66). Given that stimulation of nerves innervating white AT simultaneously enhance lipolysis rate and induce a strong vasoconstriction (54), there may be an impaired release of free fatty acids during exercise. Indeed, upon the cessation of exercise, fatty acids are suddenly “washed out” of AT, which may be related to the release of vasoconstrictor tone manifest during exercise [reviewed in Frayn et al. (26)].Aging, exercise training, and AT function. In the current study, adipose blood flow was significantly lower at rest in old vs. young subjects. There are several potential mechanisms for the lower flow at rest with old age, including 1) diminished vascular endothelial function (8, 17, 63); 2) elevated oxidative stress from AT (4), which may diminish the bioavailabilty of nitric oxide; and 3) significantly elevated basal SNS activity with old age (53), offsetting a diminished α-adrenergic sensitivity (Table 1). During submaximal exercise, the plasma NE responses are either similar (37, 39) or smaller (31) in old vs. young subjects, which in combination with a diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction (Fig. 4), likely contributes to the large increase in blood flow to AT during exercise in the OSed group. After exercise training, the AT blood flow response between age groups was largely normalized (Figs. 1 and 2), which is associated with an elevated blood flow to oxidative skeletal muscle during exercise (10). Without measurement of cardiac output, the precise relationship between the reduced AT observed herein and the elevated skeletal muscle blood flow with aging after training (10) cannot be determined and warrants future investigations. In healthy, young men, exercise training does not appear to alter adipose perfusion, as there are no differences in AT blood flow between sedentary and endurance-trained subjects at rest (67), despite a greater blood flow response to AT with adrenaline infusion after training (68). In the current study, at rest, there was an enhanced blood flow to AT in both age groups after endurance training vs. age-matched sedentary counterparts (Fig. 1A). Although not measured in the current study, there are several potential mechanisms responsible for changes in AT blood flow after training, including 1) alterations in plasma NE concentrations, 2) changes in the expression or location of adipose vascular adrenergic receptors, and 3) enhanced adipose vessel endothelial function. Changes in sympathetic nerve activity or differences in plasma NE concentrations affecting resistance artery function are unlikely, as endurance training has little effect on resting sympathetic nerve activity (62) with lower (34) or unchanged (12, 58) plasma NE concentrations after training. Given that AT blood flow is influenced largely by α-adrenergic receptor function (1a), differences in the expression of adrenergic receptors (e.g., diminished α1-receptor density with old age) among groups could contribute to differences in adipose blood flow. Given that both aging (8, 17, 63) and obesity (20) diminish resistance artery endothelial function, it is likely that improvements in endothelial function after exercise training (47, 56, 63) contributed to the greater AT perfusion at rest. During the transition from rest to exercise with old age, the AT blood flow response was directionally opposite (reduction in flow) in the exercise-trained vs. sedentary group (increased flow vs. rest; Figs. 1A and 2A). The AT blood flow response in old age after training suggests an enhanced vasoconstriction within the AT-resistance vasculature. Indeed, in AT-resistance arteries, there was an enhanced α-adrenergic (Fig. 4, A and B) and myogenic (Fig. 5A) vasoconstriction after training with old age. We are unaware of any other studies that have looked specifically at the effects of aging and/or exercise training on adipose-resistance artery function. However, exercise training has been shown to enhance α-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction within tissue that is not recruited during exercise (i.e., shows no net hyperemic response) (43), suggesting a possible systemic effect on adrenergic receptor function. There is also evidence that exercise training enhances myogenic vasoconstriction (17), which was demonstrated in the old group after training (Fig. 5A). The precise mechanisms for the altered AT-resistance artery vasoconstriction observed herein remain to be determined but likely contribute to an increased ability to mobilize free fatty acids after exercise training (13, 69).Conclusions. In summary, α-adrenergic receptor-mediated and myogenic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries are diminished with aging, which was associated with an increase in AT blood flow during exercise in the OSed group. Exercise training augmented adrenergic vasoconstriction in adipose arteries with old age, which likely contributed, in part, to the reduction in adipose blood flow during exercise relative to sedentary counterparts. An age-associated deficit in α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT may contribute to the impaired baroreflex buffering with old age (35, 76) and result in a spatial overperfusion of AT during exercise. Whereas the possibility that a blunted adipose vasoconstriction with old age diminishes the ability to redistribute blood flow to the active muscles during exercise in humans is likely, elegant studies are required to address this issue mechanistically.GRANTS Support for this study was provided, in part, by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Grants NAG2-1340 and NCC2-1166 (M.
