    "abstract": "Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months.Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.Results Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 105 cfu/m2Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.

    "introduction": "Introduction The microbiome of the built environment has been increasingly linked to human health and disease. The composition of built environments is largely influenced by its occupants [1–4] but can also be affected by external features such as seasonal variations [5, 6], architectural design [7], and level of urbanization [8]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health. For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [9]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [10]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [11–13]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [14]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [15, 16]. Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [17]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [18–20], surfaces [21, 22], and water [23]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [24] and pathogens [25] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members. The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [26] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated.",
    "methods": "Methods Sample kit preparation and sample collection Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA) by moistening polyester wipes (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ), each with 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Moistened wipes were aseptically transferred to a sterile zip lock bag and then assembled into the ISS sampling kit (at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)), which also contained sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190), benzalkonium chloride wipes (Hygea®, PDI-BZK D35185), and sterile bitran bags (VWR, Cat. 4742-S) for return. The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the premoistened polyester wipes which were the same locations as those sampled during the previous microbial tracking study (MT-1). The list of locations sampled is presented in Table 1. Flight 4 sampling occurred in 2017, and flight 5, 6, and 7 sampling occurred in 2018. A diagram of locations can be found in Figure 1 of the MT-1 published manuscript [26]. As per the study requirements, there was no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. Cleaning outside that time frame was conducted as per routine ISS activities and was performed with disinfectant wipes containing octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%). During each flight sampling session, the same crew member sampled each of the eight locations. Using the sterile gloves from the sampling kit, he/she sampled 1 m2 with the pre-moistened polyester wipes and donned a new pair of individually packed sterile gloves before sampling the next location. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. After sample collection, the samples were stored at 4 °C in orbit and then returned to Earth after 10 days for flight 4, 8 days for flight 5, 22 days for flight 6, and 11 days for flight 7. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4 °C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt. Sample processing Sample processing took place in a cleanroom at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500-mL bottle containing 200 mL of molecular grade sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4, Sigma). The wipe inside the bottle was shaken vigorously for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette using 0.22-μm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO). The captured microbes were released from the concentrating pipette using 1 mL of InnovaPrep’s elution fluid containing PBS with 0.075% Tween. The concentrate was topped up to 5 mL using sterile, molecular grade 1× PBS (pH 7.4, Sigma). DNA extraction The concentrate, from above, was split into two 1.5-mL aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PMA (18.25 μL of 2 mM, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μM) to assess cells that were viable or had an intact cell membrane [51], while the second aliquot was handled in a similar manner but without the addition of PMA. The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-Lite™ LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were split into two 0.75-mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with the samples. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μL of water and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis. Culture analysis One hundred microliters, in duplicate, of the concentrate, was plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) (for environmental bacteria), blood agar (for pathogenic bacteria), and potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 100 μg/mL of chloramphenicol (for fungi). All plates were purchased from Hardy Diagnostics (Santa Maria, CA). R2A and PDA plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days, while blood agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 days (depending on growth). Colonies were counted and the colony-forming units per m2 calculated. After colony counting, single colonies were re-streaked on fresh plates to ensure pure culture and incubated at the appropriate temperature and time, and the biomass was then archived in 30% glycerol and stored at − 80 °C. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing and taxonomic classification Metagenomics sequencing and taxonomic classification were performed as described previously [30]. Briefly, DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Quality and fragment size were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were quantitated using the Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and normalized to equivalent DNA quantities, pooled, and diluted according to the manufacturer’s standard recommendations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 with the NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair paired-end reads. Taxonomic classification of the metagenomic reads was accomplished using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT version 1.2.4b with the “April 4, 2014, LMAT Grand” reference database [lmat-4-14.20mer.db]) [52]. Reads mapping to genus Homo or below were removed from the analysis. The raw sequencing data has been deposited in NASA’s GeneLab Database accession number GLDS-252. A list of read counts for all species detected from each sample and control wipe is shown in Dataset S4. Contamination control The total number of reads and the number of reads annotated at the genus and species level are shown in Table S1. The F4–F7 negative control wipe flown to the ISS had fewer total reads compared to their corresponding flight group wipes used to sample the ISS surfaces. The microbial composition of the control samples was determined the same way as the surface samples, and the top species detected among the control samples is shown by read number (Fig. S9). The control samples showed no indication of contamination or microbial read counts that could alter the microbial profiles identified in the surface samples. Alpha diversity The alpha diversity of each sample was calculated at the genus and species level using the “renyi” and “estimateR” functions available through the vegan package (v.2.5-5) [24]. The Renyi entropy of each sample was calculated for orders 0, 1, and 2, some things referred to as the Hill numbers [25], representing the sample’s observed richness, exponentiated Shannon index, and reciprocal Simpson index, respectively. We compared the alpha diversity estimations between locations and flight groups to track the changes between the sampling locations and across all flight groups. Statistical testing was done using Student’s t-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Beta diversity and ordination The ecological distance between the surface samples was measured using the “distance” function and visualized using the “ordinate” function from the phyloseq package (v.1.24.3) [26]. Non-metric and classical multidimensional scaling was used to visualize the similarity between the surface samples using the Jaccard and Euclidean distance, respectively. The Jaccard distance was used to measure the difference in taxon presence-absence profiles, and the Euclidean distance was used to measure the difference in taxon abundance profiles between samples. Prior to measuring the Euclidean distance between each sample, the taxon read counts were transformed into Euclidean space using the center-log ratio (clr) [27]. To determine if the centroid and dispersion between the locations and flight groups were different, a PERMANOVA test was performed using the “adonis2” function available through the vegan package (v.2.5-6) [24]. Differential abundant analysis Genus and species level read counts were transformed using the clr method prior to testing for differentially abundant taxa. We performed two separate differential abundance analyses. The first analysis looked at the differences in taxon abundance between the surface locations, and the second analysis looked at the differences in taxon abundance between the flight groups. Differential abundance analysis on the clr-transformed reads was performed using the ALDEx2 package (v.1.16.0) using the “aldex.kw” function [53]. Taxa with P values < 0.05 were considered differentially abundant, and all P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [29]. Antimicrobial resistance profiles The raw metagenomic sequences were analyzed with DeepARG: a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data which uses the CARD and ARDB databases for classification using the DIAMOND aligner [54]. Briefly, the pipeline first removes low-quality reads using TRIMMOMATIC, then merges the reads into one big file (VSEARCH) which are then classified with the deepARG algorithm, and the results are normalized to the 16S rRNA abundance in the sample. The parameters used to predict the AMR genes from our metagenomics dataset were based on 80% coverage, 50% homology, a minimum probability of 0.8, and an E-value of 1e−10. Co-occurrence analysis of viable organisms Genus co-occurrence from the PMA-treated samples was examined using the “cooccur” R package. This package applied the probabilistic model of genus co-occurrence [55] to a set of genera distributed among the 32 samples (8 locations, 4 flights). The algorithm calculated the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence between each pair of genera. The expected frequency was based on the distribution of each genus being random and independent of the other genera. The package also includes functions for visualizing co-occurrence results and was used to prepare Figs. 8 and 9. Functional profiles Metagenome assembled genomes were constructed from the 32 samples (F4–F7, non-PMA-treated samples) using the MetaWRAP pipeline (https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP) [56] which performed read quality control, assembly, visualization, taxonomic profiling, extracting draft genomes (binning), and functional annotation. Assembly was performed with MegaHit (due to the large dataset) and the bin_refinement cutoff set to minimum completion of 50% and maximum contamination of 10%. Taxonomy was assigned using _nt and _tax databases and verified with CheckM. The abundances of each bin (i.e., MAG) in each sample was expressed as genome copies per million reads using Salmon. Functional analysis of the annotated genomes was performed by extracting the cluster of orthologous group (COG) IDs from the annotated gff files generated by MetaWRAP and assigning each ID to a COG category (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog/). The draft genome of Pseudomonas granadensis was analyzed by SEED and the Rapid Annotation of microbial genomes using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [57] and genomic islands assessed with IslandViewer 4 [58].",
    "results": "Results Thirty-two surface samples were collected over the course of 14 months (2017–2018) from the ISS. The locations sampled are listed in Table 1 and correspond to the same eight locations that were sampled during the MT-1 study that ran from 2015 to 2016 [26]. In addition to the sampling wipes, wipes that were taken out of the kits and exposed to the ISS environment (but not used for sampling) were designated as controls and processed alongside the samples. The flight sampling sessions are denoted as flights 4–7 (F4–F7), while the flight sampling sessions for the previously published MT-1 study are denoted as flights 1–3 (F1–F3). Table 1. Locations sampled across the International Space Station. All eight 8 locations were sampled over the course of four different flights—flight 4 (F4), flight 5 (F5), flight 6 (F6), and flight 7 (F7).

Of the total population, 38% could be attributed to viable organisms, based on the read counts obtained from propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples (which measures viable/intact organisms), with bacteria still being the most dominant group [bacteria (58%), fungi (37%), viruses (0.01%), archaea (0.004%), unclassified (4%)] (Dataset S1). The viable bacterial and fungal load was compared between F4 to F7. The average bacterial read count across all four flights was 7 × 105 counts/m2, with no statistically significant differences between them (Fig. 1A). This contrasts with the fungal read counts which did differ between flights, with F6 having the highest average sequence reads at 7.0 × 105 counts/m2 (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Metagenomic read counts obtained from surface wipes sampled during flights 4–7. Each dot of the graph represents a location sampled on the ISS. The line represents the average read count for a specific flight from all eight locations. PMA-treated samples were analyzed which measures viable/intact cells. A Read counts of the bacterial population. B Read counts of the fungal population. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance test, followed by the post hoc false discovery rate was used to compare the read counts between flightsPlate count assays were also performed. The cultivable bacterial burden was highest at F6, with an average of 2.7 × 106 cfu/m2, and lowest at F7, with 1.0 × 102 cfu/m2 (Fig. S1A). F6 also had the highest cultivable fungal burden at 1.1 × 104 cfu/m2, with F7 having below detectable fungal counts (Fig. S1A). Microbial diversity Alpha diversity Three alpha diversity indices were used to measure the microbial diversity within each sample: observed richness (Fig. 2, top panel), exponentiated Shannon index (Fig. 2, middle), and reciprocal Simpson index (Fig. 2, bottom). Included for comparison were also the MT-1 samples from F1–F3. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to determine the differences between flights, and no significant differences were observed across any of the seven flights. There were also no differences across any of the eight locations sampled (Fig. S2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Alpha diversity metrics for MT-1 and MT-2 samples. The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. Samples are grouped by flight group and colored by surface locationBeta diversity Comparison between surface samples was visualized using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using Euclidean distances (Fig. 3) and organized by location (Fig. 3A) and flight (Fig. 3B) to identify possible trends. No apparent microbiome differences were observed between locations; however, samples did appear to cluster by flight group. These observations were supported by PERMANOVA analysis of the Euclidean distances which found a significant difference between centroids and dispersions of the flight groups (P < 0.001) but not between the locations (P = 0.229). Surface samples were also visualized and analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Jaccard distances (Fig. S3), and the same trends were noted as with the PCoA data above. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab PCoA plot of MT-1 and MT-2 surface samples. Samples were colored by surface location (A) and flight group (B) to visualize the sample clustering. The distance between the samples was determined using the Euclidean distanceTaxonomic profile of ISS microbial community The top 12 most abundant bacterial species across all surface samples are shown in Fig. 4 with all but one being associated with the human microbiome. Propionibacterium acnes and the six Staphylococcus spp.: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus sp. AL1, reside on the skin and mucous membranes of humans. Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus mitis are part of the normal oral microbiome. Corynebacterium sp. GD7 (reclassified as Corynebacterium ihumii) was first isolated from a fecal sample. Lactococcus lactis is used in the dairy industry for the production of various cheeses and buttermilk. The read counts for the top 12 bacteria, organized by flight and location (including controls), are shown in Fig. S4. Fig. 4.

Samples were grouped in columns by surface location and arranged in order by flight group. “Other” refers to those bacterial species detected that were not in the top 12The top 12 most abundant fungal species across all surface samples are shown in Fig. 5. These include Malassezia globose, Malassezia restricta, and Malassezia sympodialis which are part of the healthy skin microflora. The Malassezia species constitute the majority of fungal reads in most surface samples regardless of location. Rhodotorula glutinis and Yarrowia lipolytica are common environmental fungi, and Aspergillus kawachii, Cyberlindnera jadinii, and Debaryomyces hansenii are used in the food industry. Blumeria graminis (barley powdery mildew), Penicillium aurantiogriseum (asparagus and strawberry pathogen), Puccinia striiformis (Stripe rust), and Puccinia triticina (wheat leaf rust) are all associated with plant diseases but pose no known harm to human health.

Samples were grouped by flight group (i.e., F4, F5, F6, and F7) or location (i.e., dining table, crew quarters, etc.) for analysis. While there were no differentially abundant species across locations (P < 0.05), there were 20 differentially abundant species across flights (P < 0.05) (Table 2). Table 2.

PMA-treated samples were analyzed to determine which viable bacterial and fungal genera were found to co-associate with each other. The top 50 most abundant bacteria and fungi were included in the analysis. As seen from the genus association profile in Fig. S6, Aspergillus had the most co-associations, with other fungi and bacteria while Pseudomonas did not have any. The gene association matrix in Fig. 6 shows which bacteria and fungi co-occurred with each other. Of the bacteria and fungi that were included in the analysis, the associations were all positive (i.e., presence of one likely means the presence of another) with no negative associations (i.e., presence of one likely means the absence of another). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Co-occurrence analysis. The co-occurrence analysis was performed using the 50 most abundant genera to determine the associations among organisms. The matrix shows which genera co-occurred with each other. Blue shows the positive co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one in the community, it is likely you will find another—for example, Aspergillus and Fusarium), yellow shows the negative co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one, it is likely the other will be absent), and gray shows the random occurrences that are most likely due to random chance alone—for example, Cladosporium and FusariumAntimicrobial resistance profiles Twenty-nine AMR categories were detected in the metagenomics dataset with multidrug and macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin (MLS) resistance having the highest read counts and found in all 32 samples (Fig. S7). Bacitracin, beta-lactam, diaminopyrimidine, and tetracycline resistance were also found across all samples, except from F6_1S (surface location # 1 [cupola], F6; Fig. S7). The “unclassified” category was also found in all samples (except F6_1S), and the genes that were grouped into this category were all DNA-binding regulatory proteins involved in the stress response. Of the 29 AMR categories detected above, 17 were detected in the PMA-treated group. Multidrug and MLS resistance genes still had the highest counts, though were not found in every sample, as in the non-PMA group (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Heat map of the ISS viable resistome. The metagenomic dataset was analyzed with DeepARG to look for anti-microbial resistance genes. The genes were then grouped into classes of resistance (i.e., “beta-lactam”), which is displayed in this heatmap (y-axis). The heatmap shows the relative abundance of each resistance class in each sample collected, with red being the most abundant and green the least. Gray indicates zero counts detected in that sample. The samples analyzed (x-axis) are from the PMA-treated samples which detect viable/intact cells. x-axis naming: Fx_xS_P, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola). The AMR counts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA countsMulti-dimensional scaling analysis comparing MT-2 and MT-1 samples (both PMA and non-PMA treated) showed no differences in the AMR profiles between the two studies, suggesting that the ISS resistome is relatively stable (Fig. 8).

Metagenomic data collected from the PMA-treated samples (viable/intact cells) during each of the flight sampling sessions for both the current MT-2 study (F4–F7) and the previous MT-1 study (F1–F3) was analyzed by DeepARG. Each dot represents a sample and takes into account the presence of an antimicrobial resistance gene and its abundance. Locations are depicted by colors and MT-1 vs MT-2 study, by symbolsMetagenome-assembled genomes Metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed from the 32 samples collected during flights 4–7, with 82 MAGs able to be assembled using a 50% minimum completion cutoff. Of those 82, 15 had over 90% completion. The percent completion, contamination, GC content, taxonomy, N50 (a measure of assembly quality), and genome size are summarized in Dataset S2. The heatmap in Fig. 9 shows the distribution and abundance of each MAG across all samples. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab MAG abundance heatmap. Genomes were assembled from the metagenomics reads and placed into “bins,” with each “bin” representing one metagenomic assembled genome (“MAG”). These bins were generated from the metagenomic data consisting of the 32 samples collected during the course of the study. Each bin is shown on the y-axis. The abundances are expressed as genome copies per million reads and presented, with the log10 values plotted. Red represents a high relative abundance and blue a low relative abundance. The white color represents the absence of that bin in the sample. The bin numbers were highlighted based on the phylum it was assigned to, with yellow = Actinobacteria, green = Firmicutes, blue = Bacteroidetes, and purple = Proteobacteria. Full taxonomic info for each bin can be found in Dataset S2. The x-axis shows the sample that was analyzed and the relative abundance of that bin (i.e., MAG) in that sample. x-axis naming: Fx_xS, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola)To extract functional information from these MAGs, annotation was performed on each MAG. Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) information was extracted from each annotated MAG and compiled together to provide a functional assessment of the collective microbial community, with the complete list of each COG ID presented in Dataset S3. Each annotated gene with a COG ID was then grouped together based on COG functional categories and the proportion of each functional category represented in the pie chart in Fig. 10. The most represented functional groups were amino acid transport and metabolism (12%); translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (11%); and carbohydrate transport and metabolism (9%). Genes/proteins involved in the defense mechanisms and the exchange of genetic material (i.e., mobilome) had a relatively small representation (3% and 0.1%, respectively). Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Pie chart of the cluster of orthologous groups. Functional assessment was performed by comparing the annotated MAGs against the COG database and assigning each COG ID to a category. The counts from each category are displayed as a percentage of the total counts in the pie chartWe decided to examine MAG Pseudomonas granadensis (bin.33, 99.38% completion) in further detail because it was 99.97% similar (compared by average nucleotide identity) to the whole-genome sequences of P. granadensis isolates, cultured during this study (flight 4, dining table) [27]. In addition, P. granadensis belongs to the P. fluorescens group which has many biologically relevant properties. While generally considered a BSL-1 organism, it can cause severe diseases in people who are immunocompromised and can lead to the spoilage of milk. It also exhibits biocontrol properties through its protection of plant roots from plant pathogens. Examination of MAG P. granadensis (bin.33) showed 17 genomic islands, which is indicative of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Functional analysis showed that 3% of its genome was made up of virulence and defense genes specifically related to tolerance/resistance of fluroquinolones, beta-lactams, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium, streptothricin, chromium, and colicin E2, as well as having multi-drug efflux pumps (Fig. S8). The genome also carried genes that could increase survival under unfavorable conditions, such as those involved in biofilm formation; osmotic, periplasmic, and oxidative stress; and dormancy and sporulation (Fig. S8).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The microbiome of eight surfaces from across the ISS was sampled during four separate sampling sessions (F4–F7). The viable microbiome was assessed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples that had been treated with PMA, as well as with plate count assays. Both techniques were consistent in their results, showing that the microbiome was similar across all eight locations for a given flight and validates what was previously published for MT-1 [26, 28] and with other ISS surface microbiome studies [29]. The spatial uniformity in this hermetically sealed, closed habitat suggests that microbial movement occurs readily, which should be taken into consideration if a situation arises that requires microbial sequestration. While no spatial differences were found, temporal differences did exist, with different microbial profiles and microbial loads observed among the various flights, consistent with our previous analyses [26, 28]. One influence driving these temporal differences could be the different cohorts of astronauts onboard the ISS during each sampling session. Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [29, 30], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Malassezia or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as Aspergillus kawachii and Lactococcus lactis. Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [2, 31, 32]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome. Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10% in the total population (viable/dead) to 37% in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82% (total) to 58% (viable). This would suggest that viable/intact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storage/descent to Earth/sample processing, better than those bacteria. In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices to mitigate harmful effects on astronauts and the spacecraft. One such functional examination was that of the ISS “viable resistome” which is the composition of antimicrobial resistance genes within the PMA-treated metagenomic dataset. We found a genetic composition that could provide resistance against 17 classes of drugs, many of which were broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, all of which are part of the medical toolkit onboard the ISS. The most prevalent resistance genes were against macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics and those involved in multidrug resistance, such as outer membrane porins, efflux pumps, and ABC transporters. MLS antibiotics occupy one of the leading positions among antibiotics used in outpatient treatment [33] and are used to treat a range of bacterial infections, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [34, 35], thus making it a very important drug on the ISS. Genetic resistance to MLS was found in every single sample in the total metagenomic dataset (non-PMA-treated), and in 17 out of 32 PMA-treated samples, making MLS resistance widespread across the ISS. The AMR resistance profiles did not differ across all seven flights, suggesting that even amidst changes in community composition (which we observed among the seven flights), the resistome of this microbial community is relatively stable and alludes to genetic redundancy. Functional redundancy has been documented in other microbial systems such as in plants [36], human gut [37], oceans [38], and soil [39]. One study has shown that HGT plays a substantial role in maintaining redundancy, and when HGT rates were high, the functional profile of the microbiome was very stable and recalcitrant to change, even when taxonomy was variable [40]. Our results emphasize the importance of deciphering microbial behavior and community interactions for better approaches to safety and health, since removing or preventing the growth of one or two species may not ameliorate any negative functional effects. Strong microbial interactions were observed in this study through a co-occurrence analysis used to predict the likelihood of genera to co-inhabit a particular niche, either through positive associations or through negative ones. While many positive associations were calculated, no negative associations were accounted for. The genus that exhibited the most positive associations was Aspergillus and co-occurred with both bacteria and fungi, while at the other “end” of the spectrum, Pseudomonas had no associations and exhibited only random occurrences. While wet lab studies would need to be conducted to make an accurate assessment of the impact of these ISS polymicrobial community interactions on the surrounding environment and astronaut health, some inferences can be made from the literature. In our study, Aspergillus and Fusarium formed a strong association. Co-infection studies of A. flavus with F. graminearum or F. verticillioides in maize have shown that the presence of these Fusarium species leads to enhanced aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by A. flavus, even in the absence of any changes in growth, probably due to a stress response caused by fungal competition [41, 42]. AFB1 is a secondary metabolite produced by A. flavus and A. parasiticus and is a very potent carcinogen that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma in humans when ingested or when it permeates the skin [43]. While reads for A. flavus were extremely low on ISS surfaces, the species is naturally found in foods, such as grains, cereal, corn, and peanuts. In light of the co-occurrence interactions described above and the known fact that the ISS is a stressed environment for microbes, which could increase AFB1 production as well as other mycotoxins, it may be necessary to pay close attention to microbial monitoring of food sources destined for space. Aspergillus and Staphylococcus were another positive association found in the dataset and may prove to be beneficial for both crew and the ISS. In an in vitro study analyzing mixed A. fumigatus-S. aureus biofilms, it was shown that S. aureus strongly inhibited the development of A. fumigatus biofilms [44]. The antibiofilm effects of S. aureus on A. fumigatus were a lack of extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganized fungal structures, abortive hyphae, and limited hyphal growth [44]. Conidia were also scarce, had modifications on their surface, and showed lysis [44]. In contrast, A. fumigatus single culture biofilms showed extremely organized structures, abundant hyphal growth, hyphal anastomosis, and channels, as well as some conidia and ECM [44]. Aspergillus biofilms (i) cause aspergillosis, an infection causing allergic reactions, lung disease, and infections in other organs [45, 46]; (ii) have been implicated in microbially induced corrosion of bronze and copper [47]; and (iii) have been found in tap water in private homes, hospitals, and industrial premises, resulting in altered taste, odor, the production of allergenic compounds, and mycotoxins [48, 49]. Aspergillus biofilms are difficult to eradicate once formed, so preventing their formation, possibly with mixed microbial communities of the “right” organisms, may be the best way to combat its effects on the ISS. Functional assessment was also performed by assembling reads into contigs to obtain metagenome-associated genomes or “MAGs.” Across the samples collected, 82 MAGs were able to be constructed and annotated with 15 having over 90% completeness, and comprising environmental, human-associated, and probiotic bacteria. The functional profile of the collective MAGs showed the highest representation of (i) amino acid transport and metabolism and (ii) translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. While these two pathways are among the main metabolic pathways in bacteria and fungi, their relative abundances were higher than carbohydrate utilization pathways. This may be significant in the context of a recent study comparing “unrestricted” built environments (public houses, public buildings, private houses) with “confined” built environments (intensive care units (ICU), cleanrooms, cleanroom gowning areas) where it was shown that each of the three “confined” environments had a considerably higher representation of amino acid utilization compared to carbohydrate utilization, with the opposite being true for the “unrestricted” environments (higher carbohydrate utilization compared to amino acids) [50]. While there are too few comparative studies to make any assumptions, it does raise the question as to whether organisms in more extreme built environments such as the ISS, ICU, and cleanrooms rely on different metabolic processes to survive and/or proliferate. The ability to generate good-quality MAGs from this dataset will allow us to better understand the dynamics of exchange across the ISS. For example, future analyses by the MT-2 project team will compare the ISS surface MAGs and astronaut MAGs (who were onboard the ISS at the time of collection) to track the movement of strains across ISS locations and across astronauts. Questions we hope to address in the forthcoming work are what factors contribute to the spread of certain organisms from one location to another, how long does a strain persist once deposited on a surface and after cleaning, and whether there is an exchange between astronauts even if they were not on board at the same time.",

Copyright notice ID: 9241228 PMID: 35765106 Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months.Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.Results Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 105 cfu/m2Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.

The composition of built environments is largely influenced by its occupants [1–4] but can also be affected by external features such as seasonal variations [5, 6], architectural design [7], and level of urbanization [8]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health. For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [9]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [10]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [11–13]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [14]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [15, 16]. Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [17]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [18–20], surfaces [21, 22], and water [23]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [24] and pathogens [25] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members. The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [26] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated.Results Thirty-two surface samples were collected over the course of 14 months (2017–2018) from the ISS. The locations sampled are listed in Table 1 and correspond to the same eight locations that were sampled during the MT-1 study that ran from 2015 to 2016 [26]. In addition to the sampling wipes, wipes that were taken out of the kits and exposed to the ISS environment (but not used for sampling) were designated as controls and processed alongside the samples. The flight sampling sessions are denoted as flights 4–7 (F4–F7), while the flight sampling sessions for the previously published MT-1 study are denoted as flights 1–3 (F1–F3). Table 1. Locations sampled across the International Space Station. All eight 8 locations were sampled over the course of four different flights—flight 4 (F4), flight 5 (F5), flight 6 (F6), and flight 7 (F7). Flight 4 was sampled in 2017, and F5, F6, and F7 were sampled throughout 2018 Location number Location description ISS module L1 Port panel next to the cupola Node 3 L2 Waste and hygiene compartment Node 3 L3 Advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) foot platform Node 3 L4 Dining table Node 1 L5 Overhead 4 Node 1 L6 Permanent multipurpose module (PMM) Port 1 PMM L7 Lab 3 overhead LAB L8 Port crew quarters, bump out exterior aft wall Node 2 Open in a new tabMicrobial burden All microbial domains of life were detected on the ISS, with bacteria being the most represented (82%), followed by fungi (10%), viruses (0.06%), and archaea (0.03%), along with reads that could not be identified (7%) (Dataset S1). Of the total population, 38% could be attributed to viable organisms, based on the read counts obtained from propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples (which measures viable/intact organisms), with bacteria still being the most dominant group [bacteria (58%), fungi (37%), viruses (0.01%), archaea (0.004%), unclassified (4%)] (Dataset S1). The viable bacterial and fungal load was compared between F4 to F7. The average bacterial read count across all four flights was 7 × 105 counts/m2, with no statistically significant differences between them (Fig. 1A). This contrasts with the fungal read counts which did differ between flights, with F6 having the highest average sequence reads at 7.0 × 105 counts/m2 (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Metagenomic read counts obtained from surface wipes sampled during flights 4–7. Each dot of the graph represents a location sampled on the ISS. The line represents the average read count for a specific flight from all eight locations. PMA-treated samples were analyzed which measures viable/intact cells. A Read counts of the bacterial population. B Read counts of the fungal population. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance test, followed by the post hoc false discovery rate was used to compare the read counts between flightsPlate count assays were also performed. The cultivable bacterial burden was highest at F6, with an average of 2.7 × 106 cfu/m2, and lowest at F7, with 1.0 × 102 cfu/m2 (Fig. S1A). F6 also had the highest cultivable fungal burden at 1.1 × 104 cfu/m2, with F7 having below detectable fungal counts (Fig. S1A).Microbial diversity Alpha diversity Three alpha diversity indices were used to measure the microbial diversity within each sample: observed richness (Fig. 2, top panel), exponentiated Shannon index (Fig. 2, middle), and reciprocal Simpson index (Fig. 2, bottom). Included for comparison were also the MT-1 samples from F1–F3. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to determine the differences between flights, and no significant differences were observed across any of the seven flights. There were also no differences across any of the eight locations sampled (Fig. S2). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Alpha diversity metrics for MT-1 and MT-2 samples. The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. Samples are grouped by flight group and colored by surface locationBeta diversity Comparison between surface samples was visualized using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using Euclidean distances (Fig. 3) and organized by location (Fig. 3A) and flight (Fig. 3B) to identify possible trends. No apparent microbiome differences were observed between locations; however, samples did appear to cluster by flight group. These observations were supported by PERMANOVA analysis of the Euclidean distances which found a significant difference between centroids and dispersions of the flight groups (P < 0.001) but not between the locations (P = 0.229). Surface samples were also visualized and analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Jaccard distances (Fig. S3), and the same trends were noted as with the PCoA data above. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab PCoA plot of MT-1 and MT-2 surface samples. Samples were colored by surface location (A) and flight group (B) to visualize the sample clustering. The distance between the samples was determined using the Euclidean distanceTaxonomic profile of ISS microbial community The top 12 most abundant bacterial species across all surface samples are shown in Fig. 4 with all but one being associated with the human microbiome. Propionibacterium acnes and the six Staphylococcus spp.: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus sp. AL1, reside on the skin and mucous membranes of humans. Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus mitis are part of the normal oral microbiome. Corynebacterium sp. GD7 (reclassified as Corynebacterium ihumii) was first isolated from a fecal sample. Lactococcus lactis is used in the dairy industry for the production of various cheeses and buttermilk. The read counts for the top 12 bacteria, organized by flight and location (including controls), are shown in Fig. S4. Fig. 4.

These include Malassezia globose, Malassezia restricta, and Malassezia sympodialis which are part of the healthy skin microflora. The Malassezia species constitute the majority of fungal reads in most surface samples regardless of location. Rhodotorula glutinis and Yarrowia lipolytica are common environmental fungi, and Aspergillus kawachii, Cyberlindnera jadinii, and Debaryomyces hansenii are used in the food industry. Blumeria graminis (barley powdery mildew), Penicillium aurantiogriseum (asparagus and strawberry pathogen), Puccinia striiformis (Stripe rust), and Puccinia triticina (wheat leaf rust) are all associated with plant diseases but pose no known harm to human health.

Samples were grouped by flight group (i.e., F4, F5, F6, and F7) or location (i.e., dining table, crew quarters, etc.) for analysis. While there were no differentially abundant species across locations (P < 0.05), there were 20 differentially abundant species across flights (P < 0.05) (Table 2). Table 2.

PMA-treated samples were analyzed to determine which viable bacterial and fungal genera were found to co-associate with each other. The top 50 most abundant bacteria and fungi were included in the analysis. As seen from the genus association profile in Fig. S6, Aspergillus had the most co-associations, with other fungi and bacteria while Pseudomonas did not have any. The gene association matrix in Fig. 6 shows which bacteria and fungi co-occurred with each other. Of the bacteria and fungi that were included in the analysis, the associations were all positive (i.e., presence of one likely means the presence of another) with no negative associations (i.e., presence of one likely means the absence of another). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Co-occurrence analysis. The co-occurrence analysis was performed using the 50 most abundant genera to determine the associations among organisms. The matrix shows which genera co-occurred with each other. Blue shows the positive co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one in the community, it is likely you will find another—for example, Aspergillus and Fusarium), yellow shows the negative co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one, it is likely the other will be absent), and gray shows the random occurrences that are most likely due to random chance alone—for example, Cladosporium and FusariumAntimicrobial resistance profiles Twenty-nine AMR categories were detected in the metagenomics dataset with multidrug and macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin (MLS) resistance having the highest read counts and found in all 32 samples (Fig. S7). Bacitracin, beta-lactam, diaminopyrimidine, and tetracycline resistance were also found across all samples, except from F6_1S (surface location # 1 [cupola], F6; Fig. S7). The “unclassified” category was also found in all samples (except F6_1S), and the genes that were grouped into this category were all DNA-binding regulatory proteins involved in the stress response. Of the 29 AMR categories detected above, 17 were detected in the PMA-treated group. Multidrug and MLS resistance genes still had the highest counts, though were not found in every sample, as in the non-PMA group (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Heat map of the ISS viable resistome. The metagenomic dataset was analyzed with DeepARG to look for anti-microbial resistance genes. The genes were then grouped into classes of resistance (i.e., “beta-lactam”), which is displayed in this heatmap (y-axis). The heatmap shows the relative abundance of each resistance class in each sample collected, with red being the most abundant and green the least. Gray indicates zero counts detected in that sample. The samples analyzed (x-axis) are from the PMA-treated samples which detect viable/intact cells. x-axis naming: Fx_xS_P, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola). The AMR counts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA countsMulti-dimensional scaling analysis comparing MT-2 and MT-1 samples (both PMA and non-PMA treated) showed no differences in the AMR profiles between the two studies, suggesting that the ISS resistome is relatively stable (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Comparison of ISS viable resistome among flights. NMDS plot comparing the antimicrobial resistance profile of the ISS community. Metagenomic data collected from the PMA-treated samples (viable/intact cells) during each of the flight sampling sessions for both the current MT-2 study (F4–F7) and the previous MT-1 study (F1–F3) was analyzed by DeepARG. Each dot represents a sample and takes into account the presence of an antimicrobial resistance gene and its abundance. Locations are depicted by colors and MT-1 vs MT-2 study, by symbolsMetagenome-assembled genomes Metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed from the 32 samples collected during flights 4–7, with 82 MAGs able to be assembled using a 50% minimum completion cutoff. Of those 82, 15 had over 90% completion. The percent completion, contamination, GC content, taxonomy, N50 (a measure of assembly quality), and genome size are summarized in Dataset S2. The heatmap in Fig. 9 shows the distribution and abundance of each MAG across all samples. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab MAG abundance heatmap. Genomes were assembled from the metagenomics reads and placed into “bins,” with each “bin” representing one metagenomic assembled genome (“MAG”). These bins were generated from the metagenomic data consisting of the 32 samples collected during the course of the study. Each bin is shown on the y-axis. The abundances are expressed as genome copies per million reads and presented, with the log10 values plotted. Red represents a high relative abundance and blue a low relative abundance. The white color represents the absence of that bin in the sample. The bin numbers were highlighted based on the phylum it was assigned to, with yellow = Actinobacteria, green = Firmicutes, blue = Bacteroidetes, and purple = Proteobacteria. Full taxonomic info for each bin can be found in Dataset S2. The x-axis shows the sample that was analyzed and the relative abundance of that bin (i.e., MAG) in that sample. x-axis naming: Fx_xS, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola)To extract functional information from these MAGs, annotation was performed on each MAG. Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) information was extracted from each annotated MAG and compiled together to provide a functional assessment of the collective microbial community, with the complete list of each COG ID presented in Dataset S3. Each annotated gene with a COG ID was then grouped together based on COG functional categories and the proportion of each functional category represented in the pie chart in Fig. 10. The most represented functional groups were amino acid transport and metabolism (12%); translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (11%); and carbohydrate transport and metabolism (9%). Genes/proteins involved in the defense mechanisms and the exchange of genetic material (i.e., mobilome) had a relatively small representation (3% and 0.1%, respectively). Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Pie chart of the cluster of orthologous groups. Functional assessment was performed by comparing the annotated MAGs against the COG database and assigning each COG ID to a category. The counts from each category are displayed as a percentage of the total counts in the pie chartWe decided to examine MAG Pseudomonas granadensis (bin.33, 99.38% completion) in further detail because it was 99.97% similar (compared by average nucleotide identity) to the whole-genome sequences of P. granadensis isolates, cultured during this study (flight 4, dining table) [27]. In addition, P. granadensis belongs to the P. fluorescens group which has many biologically relevant properties. While generally considered a BSL-1 organism, it can cause severe diseases in people who are immunocompromised and can lead to the spoilage of milk. It also exhibits biocontrol properties through its protection of plant roots from plant pathogens. Examination of MAG P. granadensis (bin.33) showed 17 genomic islands, which is indicative of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Functional analysis showed that 3% of its genome was made up of virulence and defense genes specifically related to tolerance/resistance of fluroquinolones, beta-lactams, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium, streptothricin, chromium, and colicin E2, as well as having multi-drug efflux pumps (Fig. S8). The genome also carried genes that could increase survival under unfavorable conditions, such as those involved in biofilm formation; osmotic, periplasmic, and oxidative stress; and dormancy and sporulation (Fig. S8).Discussion The microbiome of eight surfaces from across the ISS was sampled during four separate sampling sessions (F4–F7). The viable microbiome was assessed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples that had been treated with PMA, as well as with plate count assays. Both techniques were consistent in their results, showing that the microbiome was similar across all eight locations for a given flight and validates what was previously published for MT-1 [26, 28] and with other ISS surface microbiome studies [29]. The spatial uniformity in this hermetically sealed, closed habitat suggests that microbial movement occurs readily, which should be taken into consideration if a situation arises that requires microbial sequestration. While no spatial differences were found, temporal differences did exist, with different microbial profiles and microbial loads observed among the various flights, consistent with our previous analyses [26, 28]. One influence driving these temporal differences could be the different cohorts of astronauts onboard the ISS during each sampling session. Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [29, 30], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Malassezia or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as Aspergillus kawachii and Lactococcus lactis. Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [2, 31, 32]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome. Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10% in the total population (viable/dead) to 37% in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82% (total) to 58% (viable). This would suggest that viable/intact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storage/descent to Earth/sample processing, better than those bacteria. In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices to mitigate harmful effects on astronauts and the spacecraft. One such functional examination was that of the ISS “viable resistome” which is the composition of antimicrobial resistance genes within the PMA-treated metagenomic dataset. We found a genetic composition that could provide resistance against 17 classes of drugs, many of which were broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, all of which are part of the medical toolkit onboard the ISS. The most prevalent resistance genes were against macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics and those involved in multidrug resistance, such as outer membrane porins, efflux pumps, and ABC transporters. MLS antibiotics occupy one of the leading positions among antibiotics used in outpatient treatment [33] and are used to treat a range of bacterial infections, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [34, 35], thus making it a very important drug on the ISS. Genetic resistance to MLS was found in every single sample in the total metagenomic dataset (non-PMA-treated), and in 17 out of 32 PMA-treated samples, making MLS resistance widespread across the ISS. The AMR resistance profiles did not differ across all seven flights, suggesting that even amidst changes in community composition (which we observed among the seven flights), the resistome of this microbial community is relatively stable and alludes to genetic redundancy. Functional redundancy has been documented in other microbial systems such as in plants [36], human gut [37], oceans [38], and soil [39]. One study has shown that HGT plays a substantial role in maintaining redundancy, and when HGT rates were high, the functional profile of the microbiome was very stable and recalcitrant to change, even when taxonomy was variable [40]. Our results emphasize the importance of deciphering microbial behavior and community interactions for better approaches to safety and health, since removing or preventing the growth of one or two species may not ameliorate any negative functional effects. Strong microbial interactions were observed in this study through a co-occurrence analysis used to predict the likelihood of genera to co-inhabit a particular niche, either through positive associations or through negative ones. While many positive associations were calculated, no negative associations were accounted for. The genus that exhibited the most positive associations was Aspergillus and co-occurred with both bacteria and fungi, while at the other “end” of the spectrum, Pseudomonas had no associations and exhibited only random occurrences. While wet lab studies would need to be conducted to make an accurate assessment of the impact of these ISS polymicrobial community interactions on the surrounding environment and astronaut health, some inferences can be made from the literature. In our study, Aspergillus and Fusarium formed a strong association. Co-infection studies of A. flavus with F. graminearum or F. verticillioides in maize have shown that the presence of these Fusarium species leads to enhanced aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by A. flavus, even in the absence of any changes in growth, probably due to a stress response caused by fungal competition [41, 42]. AFB1 is a secondary metabolite produced by A. flavus and A. parasiticus and is a very potent carcinogen that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma in humans when ingested or when it permeates the skin [43]. While reads for A. flavus were extremely low on ISS surfaces, the species is naturally found in foods, such as grains, cereal, corn, and peanuts. In light of the co-occurrence interactions described above and the known fact that the ISS is a stressed environment for microbes, which could increase AFB1 production as well as other mycotoxins, it may be necessary to pay close attention to microbial monitoring of food sources destined for space. Aspergillus and Staphylococcus were another positive association found in the dataset and may prove to be beneficial for both crew and the ISS. In an in vitro study analyzing mixed A. fumigatus-S. aureus biofilms, it was shown that S. aureus strongly inhibited the development of A. fumigatus biofilms [44]. The antibiofilm effects of S. aureus on A. fumigatus were a lack of extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganized fungal structures, abortive hyphae, and limited hyphal growth [44]. Conidia were also scarce, had modifications on their surface, and showed lysis [44]. In contrast, A. fumigatus single culture biofilms showed extremely organized structures, abundant hyphal growth, hyphal anastomosis, and channels, as well as some conidia and ECM [44]. Aspergillus biofilms (i) cause aspergillosis, an infection causing allergic reactions, lung disease, and infections in other organs [45, 46]; (ii) have been implicated in microbially induced corrosion of bronze and copper [47]; and (iii) have been found in tap water in private homes, hospitals, and industrial premises, resulting in altered taste, odor, the production of allergenic compounds, and mycotoxins [48, 49]. Aspergillus biofilms are difficult to eradicate once formed, so preventing their formation, possibly with mixed microbial communities of the “right” organisms, may be the best way to combat its effects on the ISS. Functional assessment was also performed by assembling reads into contigs to obtain metagenome-associated genomes or “MAGs.” Across the samples collected, 82 MAGs were able to be constructed and annotated with 15 having over 90% completeness, and comprising environmental, human-associated, and probiotic bacteria. The functional profile of the collective MAGs showed the highest representation of (i) amino acid transport and metabolism and (ii) translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. While these two pathways are among the main metabolic pathways in bacteria and fungi, their relative abundances were higher than carbohydrate utilization pathways. This may be significant in the context of a recent study comparing “unrestricted” built environments (public houses, public buildings, private houses) with “confined” built environments (intensive care units (ICU), cleanrooms, cleanroom gowning areas) where it was shown that each of the three “confined” environments had a considerably higher representation of amino acid utilization compared to carbohydrate utilization, with the opposite being true for the “unrestricted” environments (higher carbohydrate utilization compared to amino acids) [50]. While there are too few comparative studies to make any assumptions, it does raise the question as to whether organisms in more extreme built environments such as the ISS, ICU, and cleanrooms rely on different metabolic processes to survive and/or proliferate. The ability to generate good-quality MAGs from this dataset will allow us to better understand the dynamics of exchange across the ISS. For example, future analyses by the MT-2 project team will compare the ISS surface MAGs and astronaut MAGs (who were onboard the ISS at the time of collection) to track the movement of strains across ISS locations and across astronauts. Questions we hope to address in the forthcoming work are what factors contribute to the spread of certain organisms from one location to another, how long does a strain persist once deposited on a surface and after cleaning, and whether there is an exchange between astronauts even if they were not on board at the same time.Conclusion Utilizing various metagenomics analyses as well as culture, this paper has provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, how the microbiome and resistome changes over time and space, and the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built environment. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.Methods Sample kit preparation and sample collection Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA) by moistening polyester wipes (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ), each with 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Moistened wipes were aseptically transferred to a sterile zip lock bag and then assembled into the ISS sampling kit (at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)), which also contained sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190), benzalkonium chloride wipes (Hygea®, PDI-BZK D35185), and sterile bitran bags (VWR, Cat. 4742-S) for return. The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the premoistened polyester wipes which were the same locations as those sampled during the previous microbial tracking study (MT-1). The list of locations sampled is presented in Table 1. Flight 4 sampling occurred in 2017, and flight 5, 6, and 7 sampling occurred in 2018. A diagram of locations can be found in Figure 1 of the MT-1 published manuscript [26]. As per the study requirements, there was no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. Cleaning outside that time frame was conducted as per routine ISS activities and was performed with disinfectant wipes containing octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%). During each flight sampling session, the same crew member sampled each of the eight locations. Using the sterile gloves from the sampling kit, he/she sampled 1 m2 with the pre-moistened polyester wipes and donned a new pair of individually packed sterile gloves before sampling the next location. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. After sample collection, the samples were stored at 4 °C in orbit and then returned to Earth after 10 days for flight 4, 8 days for flight 5, 22 days for flight 6, and 11 days for flight 7. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4 °C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt.Sample processing Sample processing took place in a cleanroom at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500-mL bottle containing 200 mL of molecular grade sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4, Sigma). The wipe inside the bottle was shaken vigorously for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette using 0.22-μm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO). The captured microbes were released from the concentrating pipette using 1 mL of InnovaPrep’s elution fluid containing PBS with 0.075% Tween. The concentrate was topped up to 5 mL using sterile, molecular grade 1× PBS (pH 7.4, Sigma).DNA extraction The concentrate, from above, was split into two 1.5-mL aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PMA (18.25 μL of 2 mM, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μM) to assess cells that were viable or had an intact cell membrane [51], while the second aliquot was handled in a similar manner but without the addition of PMA. The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-Lite™ LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were split into two 0.75-mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with the samples. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μL of water and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis.Culture analysis One hundred microliters, in duplicate, of the concentrate, was plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) (for environmental bacteria), blood agar (for pathogenic bacteria), and potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 100 μg/mL of chloramphenicol (for fungi). All plates were purchased from Hardy Diagnostics (Santa Maria, CA). R2A and PDA plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days, while blood agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 days (depending on growth). Colonies were counted and the colony-forming units per m2 calculated. After colony counting, single colonies were re-streaked on fresh plates to ensure pure culture and incubated at the appropriate temperature and time, and the biomass was then archived in 30% glycerol and stored at − 80 °C.Shotgun metagenomics sequencing and taxonomic classification Metagenomics sequencing and taxonomic classification were performed as described previously [30]. Briefly, DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Quality and fragment size were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were quantitated using the Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and normalized to equivalent DNA quantities, pooled, and diluted according to the manufacturer’s standard recommendations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 with the NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair paired-end reads. Taxonomic classification of the metagenomic reads was accomplished using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT version 1.2.4b with the “April 4, 2014, LMAT Grand” reference database [lmat-4-14.20mer.db]) [52]. Reads mapping to genus Homo or below were removed from the analysis. The raw sequencing data has been deposited in NASA’s GeneLab Database accession number GLDS-252. A list of read counts for all species detected from each sample and control wipe is shown in Dataset S4.Contamination control The total number of reads and the number of reads annotated at the genus and species level are shown in Table S1. The F4–F7 negative control wipe flown to the ISS had fewer total reads compared to their corresponding flight group wipes used to sample the ISS surfaces. The microbial composition of the control samples was determined the same way as the surface samples, and the top species detected among the control samples is shown by read number (Fig. S9). The control samples showed no indication of contamination or microbial read counts that could alter the microbial profiles identified in the surface samples.Alpha diversity The alpha diversity of each sample was calculated at the genus and species level using the “renyi” and “estimateR” functions available through the vegan package (v.2.5-5) [24]. The Renyi entropy of each sample was calculated for orders 0, 1, and 2, some things referred to as the Hill numbers [25], representing the sample’s observed richness, exponentiated Shannon index, and reciprocal Simpson index, respectively. We compared the alpha diversity estimations between locations and flight groups to track the changes between the sampling locations and across all flight groups. Statistical testing was done using Student’s t-test and Kruskal-Wallis test.Beta diversity and ordination The ecological distance between the surface samples was measured using the “distance” function and visualized using the “ordinate” function from the phyloseq package (v.1.24.3) [26]. Non-metric and classical multidimensional scaling was used to visualize the similarity between the surface samples using the Jaccard and Euclidean distance, respectively. The Jaccard distance was used to measure the difference in taxon presence-absence profiles, and the Euclidean distance was used to measure the difference in taxon abundance profiles between samples. Prior to measuring the Euclidean distance between each sample, the taxon read counts were transformed into Euclidean space using the center-log ratio (clr) [27]. To determine if the centroid and dispersion between the locations and flight groups were different, a PERMANOVA test was performed using the “adonis2” function available through the vegan package (v.2.5-6) [24].Differential abundant analysis Genus and species level read counts were transformed using the clr method prior to testing for differentially abundant taxa. We performed two separate differential abundance analyses. The first analysis looked at the differences in taxon abundance between the surface locations, and the second analysis looked at the differences in taxon abundance between the flight groups. Differential abundance analysis on the clr-transformed reads was performed using the ALDEx2 package (v.1.16.0) using the “aldex.kw” function [53]. Taxa with P values < 0.05 were considered differentially abundant, and all P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [29].Antimicrobial resistance profiles The raw metagenomic sequences were analyzed with DeepARG: a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data which uses the CARD and ARDB databases for classification using the DIAMOND aligner [54]. Briefly, the pipeline first removes low-quality reads using TRIMMOMATIC, then merges the reads into one big file (VSEARCH) which are then classified with the deepARG algorithm, and the results are normalized to the 16S rRNA abundance in the sample. The parameters used to predict the AMR genes from our metagenomics dataset were based on 80% coverage, 50% homology, a minimum probability of 0.8, and an E-value of 1e−10.Co-occurrence analysis of viable organisms Genus co-occurrence from the PMA-treated samples was examined using the “cooccur” R package. This package applied the probabilistic model of genus co-occurrence [55] to a set of genera distributed among the 32 samples (8 locations, 4 flights). The algorithm calculated the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence between each pair of genera. The expected frequency was based on the distribution of each genus being random and independent of the other genera. The package also includes functions for visualizing co-occurrence results and was used to prepare Figs. 8 and 9.Functional profiles Metagenome assembled genomes were constructed from the 32 samples (F4–F7, non-PMA-treated samples) using the MetaWRAP pipeline (https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP) [56] which performed read quality control, assembly, visualization, taxonomic profiling, extracting draft genomes (binning), and functional annotation. Assembly was performed with MegaHit (due to the large dataset) and the bin_refinement cutoff set to minimum completion of 50% and maximum contamination of 10%. Taxonomy was assigned using _nt and _tax databases and verified with CheckM. The abundances of each bin (i.e., MAG) in each sample was expressed as genome copies per million reads using Salmon. Functional analysis of the annotated genomes was performed by extracting the cluster of orthologous group (COG) IDs from the annotated gff files generated by MetaWRAP and assigning each ID to a COG category (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog/). The draft genome of Pseudomonas granadensis was analyzed by SEED and the Rapid Annotation of microbial genomes using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [57] and genomic islands assessed with IslandViewer 4 [58].Supplementary Information 40168_2022_1293_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (983.5KB, pdf) Additional file 1: Figure S1.

The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson Index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. F4 (green), F5 (yellow), F6 (purple), and F7 (red) samples are grouped by surface location. Figure S3. NMDS plot of MT-1 and MT-2 surface samples. Samples were colored by surface location (A) and flight group (B) to visualize samples clustering. The distance between samples was determined using the Jaccard dissimilarity. Figure S4. Top 12 most abundant bacterial species by flight group. The top 12 most abundance fungal species for F4 (A), F5 (B), F6 (C), and F7 (D) were determined separately. The read counts for each species are shown by surface location. “Other” refers to those bacterial species detected that were not in the top 12. Figure S5. Top 12 most abundant fungal species by flight group. The top 12 most abundance fungal species for F4 (A), F5 (B), F6 (C), and F7 (D) were determined separately. The read counts for each species are shown by surface location. “Other” refers to those fungal species detected that were not in the top 12. Figure S6. Co-occurrence analysis. Co-occurrence analysis was performed using the 50 most abundant genera to determine associations amongst organisms. The x-axis shows the organisms that were included in the analysis and the y-axis shows the percent of either negative, positive or random associations. Gray bars represent random associations, blue bars represent positive associations and yellow bars represent negative associations. The genera are listed in order of least occurrences (left) to most occurrences (right). Figure S7. Heat map of ISS resistome. The metagenomic dataset was analyzed with DeepARG to look for anti-microbial resistance genes. The genes were then grouped into classes of resistance (i.e “beta-lactam”), which is displayed in this heatmap (y-axis). The heat-map shows the relative abundance of each resistance class in each sample collected, with red being the most abundant and green the least. Gray indicates zero counts detected in that sample The samples analyzed (x-axis) are from the non-PMA treated samples. x-axis naming: Fx_xS, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to cupola). The AMR counts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA counts. Figure S8. Subsystem category distribution of Pseudomonas fluroescens metagenome assembled genome. The metaWRAP pipeline was used to assemble and annotate draft genomes constructed from the metagenomic data of 32 samples (F4-F7), otherwise known as MAGs- metagenomic assembled genomes. The MAG of Pseudomonas fluorescens was further analyzed with SEED and RAST. Figure S9. Read counts for control samples. The top 12 most abundance species across the control samples are colored. The read counts in the controls were significantly less than those detected in the samples and had different profiles. 40168_2022_1293_MOESM2_ESM.docx (16.9KB, docx) Additional file 2: Table S1.

Copyright notice ID: 5958250 PMID: 29773617 ABSTRACT Here, we present the whole-genome sequences of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates cultured from infected Zinnia hybrida plants that were grown onboard the International Space Station (ISS).GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT The Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops (1), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans (2, 3). However, F. oxysporum, like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are beneficial to humans (4, 5) and could be exploited for use in the pharmaceutical/medical industries. During the course of the “Veggie” project (a vegetable production system flown onboard the International Space Station [ISS] to study the effects of the space environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became afflicted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2) of these infected plants, and the draft whole-genome sequences are described herein. The whole-genome sequences were paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size. A total of 33 million reads (GC content, 47.5%) and 46 million reads (GC content, 46.8%) were obtained from VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, respectively. Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch, 2; how accurate the match between the two adaptor ligated reads, 30; how accurate the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings, minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 (6) using k-mer sizes of 80 (VEG-01C1) and 88 (VEG-01C2). The VEG-01C1 assembly resulted in a genome size of 49.3 Mb, with an N50 value of 376,797 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,455, with a max scaffold length of 1,817,733 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 588. The VEG-01C2 assembly resulted in a genome size of 48.9 Mb, with an N50 of 334,342 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,398, with a max scaffold length of 2,326,957 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 637. The assembled genomes were compared to those of 66 F. oxysporum isolates downloaded from  (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/), as well as those of two isolates cultured from ISS environmental surfaces, using (i) 10 phylogenetically informative loci (7) and (ii) the presence/absence of effector proteins (8). Both methods showed that VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2 were most closely related to F. oxysporum IMV-00293, an isolate cultured in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_001931975). To note, this isolate was incorrectly identified and deposited as Fusarium solani (9). Interestingly, F. oxysporum strains VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and IMV-00293 (i.e., the Chernobyl strain) were very similar to the clinical F. oxysporum strain FOSC 3-a (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_000271745), an isolate cultured from blood from a patient in the United States suffering from fusariosis. Comparative genomics of these Z. hybrida leaf and root fungal strains with the Chernobyl (IMV-00293) strain could provide insight into which genes could allow for growth in extreme environments, such as those involved in radiation resistance. Accession number(s). The assembled whole-genome sequences have been deposited in DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers PXUO00000000 (VEG-01C1) and PXUN00000000 (VEG-01C2). The strains have also been deposited in NASA’s GeneLab; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-177/.

    "abstract": "Abstract Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate. Keywords: secondary metabolites, Aspergillus niger, International Space Station, pyranonigrin A, antioxidant",
    "introduction": "Introduction Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo (Pierson, 2001; Novikova et al., 2006; Van Houdt et al., 2012). Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system (Pierson, 2001; Sonnenfeld et al., 2003). Additionally, several studies have indicated that spacecraft environments increase microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance (Tixador et al., 1985; Wilson et al., 2007, 2008). As we make strides toward human interplanetary exploration, investigations into the characteristics of filamentous fungi that reside in spacecraft environments are critical for crew health. Additionally, such studies present diverse industrial and therapeutic opportunities, as fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to external stressors. These small molecules often kill or inhibit growth of other organisms, enabling fungi to successfully compete within the complex ecosystem they reside in. While some SMs are toxic to humans, others have diverse industrial and therapeutic applications, including antibiotic, anticancer, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and cholesterol-lowering activities (Newman and Cragg, 2012). The remarkable structural and functional diversity of fungal SMs arise from the combinatorial and modular nature of their biosynthesis, in which the SM core backbone is biosynthesized by a core synthase enzyme, such as a polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), or a hybrid PKS-NRPS, and further diversified by a number of tailoring enzymes that are clustered together within the genome (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006). In order to understand the characteristics of microbes residing in the International Space Station (ISS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has implemented a robust microbial monitoring system (Pierson et al., 2013). The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has been reported to be a predominant ISS isolate (Checinska et al., 2015), and is frequently detected in other built environments (Haleem Khan and Mohan Karuppayil, 2012; Varga et al., 2014). A. niger is a melanized fungal species commonly used in the biotech industry as a production host for citric acid and enzymes (Schuster et al., 2002). Melanized fungi are commonly isolated from highly irradiated environments (Singaravelan et al., 2008; Selbmann et al., 2015), and it has been reported that the electronic properties of melanin change following exposure to ionizing radiation (Dadachova et al., 2007). Additionally, several studies have reported the association of melanin production with fungal virulence (Kwon-Chung et al., 1982; Wang et al., 1995; Nosanchuk et al., 1998). Together, these findings demonstrate the need for studies that assess the characteristics of melanized fungi inhabiting spacecraft environments. Naphtho-γ-pyrones are the predominant class of SMs produced by A. niger, and they possess a diverse array of reported biological properties, including anti-HIV, anti-hyperuricemia, anti-tubercular, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant activities (Choque et al., 2015). Advances in genome sequencing of A. niger have revealed its capacity to produce many other SMs in addition to the naphtho-γ-pyrones, as its genome harbors 46 PKSs, 35 NRPSs, and 9 NRPS-PKS hybrid genes (Romsdahl and Wang, 2019). Many of these SM biosynthesis genes are silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions, which has resulted in a lack of studies on SMs that may have useful industrial and therapeutic properties. Given that fungi produce SMs in response to environmental stress, investigations into SM production of A. niger strains isolated from space environments may reveal enhanced production levels of bioactive molecules and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Here, we report the SM production of JSC-093350089, a previously described strain of A. niger isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Our analysis revealed that the ISS isolate produces high levels of the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), along with other bioactive SMs, such as kotanin, pestalamide B, and naphtho-γ-pyrones, when compared to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. To investigate differences between the strains that may explain the increased production of some SMs in JSC-093350089, we conducted a comparative genetic analysis of biosynthesis clusters and regulators of differentially produced SMs. Finally, the UV resistance potential of pyranonigrin A was assessed.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Secondary Metabolite Extraction and Analysis JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates, starting with 1 × 107 spores per Petri dish (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 25 ml methanol (MeOH), followed by 25 ml 1:1 MeOH-dichloromethane, each with 1 h of sonication and filtration. The extract was evaporated in vacuo and re-dissolved in 2 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in MeOH and a portion (10 μl) was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 μm; 2.1 by 100 mm; Alltech Prevail) at a flow rate of 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for HPLC-DAD-MS was 95% MeCN/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with solvent B from 45 to 50 min. Strains and Molecular Manipulations The A. niger wild-type and mutant strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1, primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2, and diagnostic PCR results are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Deletion cassettes were generated using the double joint PCR technique (Supplementary Figure S2; Yu et al., 2004). DNA insertions into the A. niger genome were performed using protoplasts and standard PEG transformation. To develop an efficient gene targeting system in JSC-093350089, the kusA gene was first deleted by replacing it with the hygromycin resistance marker (hph). The two amplified flanking sequences and the hygromycin phosphortransferase gene (hph) marker cassette amplified from pCB1003 (Fungal Genetics Stock Center) were fused together into one construct by fusion PCR using nested primers, and the mutation was selected for by growth on media containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Diagnostic PCR was performed on the deletant strain using external primers (P1 and P6) from the first round of PCR. The difference in size between the gene replaced by the selection marker and the native gene allowed us to determine whether the transformants carried the correct gene replacement. Next, an auxotrophic mutant in the kusA- background was generated by deleting the pyrG gene. Two ∼1500 base pair fragments upstream and downstream of pyrG were amplified and fused together (Supplementary Figure S3). The mutation was selected for by growth on media supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), as only cells lacking the pyrG gene can survive when 5-FOA is present. The correct transformants were identified by performing diagnostic PCR on the deletant strain using external primers (P1 and P6) from the first round of PCR. All other deletant strains were generated by replacing each target gene with the A. fumigatus pyrG gene (AfpyrG). Double deletion mutants were generated by recycling the AfpyrG gene in CW12006. This involved amplifying two ∼1500 base pair fragments upstream and downstream from the alba::AfpyrG region of JSC-093350089 albAΔ genome, which were then fused together. The mutation was selected for by growth on media supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of 5-FOA. Correct transformants were identified using diagnostic PCR with external and internal primers (P1 and AfpyrG rev; AfpyrG Fw and P6). To reintegrate the kusA gene into the genome of CW12005, the AfpyrG gene used to initially delete pyrA was deleted according to the strategy described in Supplementary Figure S3, which generated CW12014. The kusA gene was amplified from JSC-093350089 gDNA to include ∼1500 base pair fragment upstream and ∼500 bp fragment downstream from kusA. This fragment was then fused to the AfpyrG gene and the original 3′ region amplified for initial kusA deletion (Supplementary Figure S4). The kusA was reintegrated into the genome of CW12014 to generate CW12015. Correct transformants were identified using diagnostic PCR with external primers (P1 and P6). Genetic Variant Analysis Paired-end Illumina sequence reads, obtained from a previous study (Romsdahl et al., 2018), were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) and quality was checked using FastQC v 0.11.7 (Andrews, 2010). The A. niger ATCC 1015 genome and annotation files were downloaded from the FungiDB web portal (Stajich et al., 2012). Trimmed reads were mapped to the ATCC 1015 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package v 0.7.17 (Li and Durbin, 2009). Mapped read files were further processed using SAMtools v 1.9 (Li et al., 2009) and PCR artifacts were removed using Picard tools MarkDuplicates1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were identified using GATK v 3.8.7 (McKenna et al., 2010). Sequence reads containing putative INDELs were realigned using GATK’s IndelRealigner and variants within each sample were called using GATK’s Haplotype Caller. GATK’s VariantFiltration was used to filter the resulting Variant Call Format (VCF) file using stringent cutoffs for quality and coverage {SNPs: QD < 2.0, MQ < 40.0, QUAL < 100, FS > 60.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4.0, ReadPosRankSum < −8.0; INDELs: QD < 2.0, FS > 200.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4, InbreedingCoeff < −0.8, ReadPosRankSum < −20.0}, so that only high-quality variants remained. PromPredict was used to predict if any upstream intergenic variants within 1000 bps of the coding sequence (CDS) occurred within the promoter region (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010; Yella et al., 2018). UVC Resistance Analysis UVC radiation resistance was assessed using JSC-093350089 WT and CW12015. Both strains were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates by seeding 1 × 107 spores per Petri dish (D = 10 cm). Spores were collected after 5 days of growth and counted. An equal amount of spores were resuspended in 5 ml of GMM agar and poured onto Petri dishes consisting of 20 ml GMM agar. Mycelia-containing plates were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation in triplicate using a CL-1000 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (UVP, Inc.).",
    "results": "Results Secondary Metabolite Analysis of JSC-093350089 SM profiles of JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were examined after growth on GMM agar medium using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). SMs were identified based on mass, UV-Vis absorption, and retention time (Supplementary Figure S5), which were in good agreement with literature (Chiang et al., 2011). The identity of pyranonigrin A was further verified by purchasing the pure compound from Enzo Life Sciences (Supplementary Figure S6). The data revealed that each strain produced a distinct SM profile, with the production yield of most SMs significantly altered (Figure 1A). Production yield analysis was carried out for each SM (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S7). Compared to ATCC 1015, a significant decrease in the production of nigragillin, an insecticide (Isogai et al., 1975), was observed (P = 0.0001). The most significant difference was observed with the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), highlighted in purple in Figure 1A, which exhibited a 6000% increase in production in JSC-093350089 (P = 0.04), as it was produced at basal levels in ATCC 1015. Nigerazine B displayed no statistical difference in production levels (P = 0.06). In the ISS strain, pestalamide B production was approximately 2 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03), and bicoumanigrin, which was reported to have cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines (Hiort et al., 2004), exhibited a production yield 2.5 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.01). Kotanin production in the ISS strain was approximately 10 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab (A) Secondary metabolite production in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015 following growth on GMM for 5 days, as detected by DAD total scan. Each individual metabolite’s production yield is reported as increased, decreased, or no change, compared to that of ATCC 1015. Pyranonigrin A is highlighted in purple and albA pathway SMs are highlighted in green. (B) Quantification of secondary metabolites showing percent change for each metabolite in JSC-093350089 when compared to ATCC 1015. Significance was determined using Welch’s t-test. *P ≤ 0.05; ****P ≤ 0.0001.The majority of SMs produced were identified as naphtho-γ-pyrones, including aurasperone A, B, and C, fonsecinone A, B, and C, a fonsecinone C derivative, and asperpyrone B and C. These SMs, highlighted in green in Figure 1A, are biosynthesized by the PKS AlbA (Chiang et al., 2011). The molecular formula of the final SM, labeled as peak 6 in Figure 1A, was predicted using high-resolution mass spectrometry, and a thorough literature search revealed that no known A. niger SM matched this formula. This SM was later determined to also be biosynthesized by the albA pathway when A. niger devoid of AlbA failed to produce the unknown compound. The combined production yields of albA pathway SMs were approximately 2.5 times higher in the ISS stain compared to ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03). Analysis of the Potential Gene Clusters Responsible for Production of Pyranonigrin A in silico To facilitate a more detailed analysis of the underlying genetics that may have led to enhanced production of pyranonigrin A in JSC-093350089, we set out to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster in A. niger. First, we searched for the core backbone synthase gene involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. The biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin E, a SM very similar to pyranonigrin A, was recently proposed and pynA (An11g00250) was identified as the PKS-NRPS hybrid involved in its biosynthesis (Awakawa et al., 2013). We hypothesized that pyranonigrin A is either biosynthesized by the same cluster responsible for pyranonigrin E production, or by a different cluster harboring a PKS-NRPS hybrid gene similar to pynA. The genome of ATCC 1015 possesses 8 PKS-NRPS hybrid genes other than pynA. BLAST analysis was performed using the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) MycoCosm database (Grigoriev et al., 2014) on the 8 remaining PKS-NRPS hybrids to determine which genes possessed high sequence homology to pynA. The results revealed that An18g00520 (pyrA) possessed high sequence similarity to pynA, with 53.4% sequence identity and 89.8% subject coverage (Supplementary Table S3). Development of an Efficient Gene Targeting System in JSC-093350089 and Identification of the PKS-NRPS Hybrid Responsible for Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis To determine which of the two putative PKS-NRPS hybrids is involved in the biosynthesis of pyranonigrin A, a genetic system was developed in JSC-093350089. The kusA gene was first deleted to decrease the rate of nonhomologous integration of transforming DNA fragments, thereby improving gene targeting efficiency (Meyer et al., 2007). Next, the pyrG gene was deleted in the kusA- background to generate CW12003, an auxotrophic mutant that requires uracil and uridine supplementation (Arentshorst et al., 2015). CW12003 was then used to generate mutant strains CW12004 and CW12005, which had the pynA gene and An18g00520 genes deleted, respectively. JSC-093350089 and the two mutant strains were then cultured on GMM, and SMs were extracted following 5 days of growth and subjected to HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Observation of SM traces as detected by UV-Vis total scan and mass spectroscopy in positive ion mode [M+H]+ m/z = 224 revealed pyranonigrin A production in pynA- (CW12004) and the complete elimination of pyranonigrin A in An18g00520- (CW12005) (Supplementary Figure S8), indicating that An18g00520 is responsible for the production of pyranonigrin A. This finding was recently confirmed in Penicillium thymicola and reported while our work was being completed (Tang et al., 2018). Identification of Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Next, we aimed to identify additional genes involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. To accomplish this, we identified genes surrounding pyrA (Figure 2A and Table 1), as the genes involved in fungal SM biosynthesis are usually clustered in the genome (Keller et al., 2005). Interestingly, when we compared the genes surrounding pyrA in A. niger to their homologs in P. thymicola using the JGI MycoCosm database (Grigoriev et al., 2014), we noticed that the distribution of genes surrounding pyrA differed between the P. thymicola and A. niger genomes (Supplementary Figure S9; Tang et al., 2018). For example, pyrD, a hydrolase predicted to be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis in P. thymicola, is adjacent to pyrC in the P. thymicola genome and has only two genes separating it from pyrA. However, its homolog within the A. niger genome, An18g00470, is adjacent to An18g00480 and has four genes separating it from pyrA. Similarly, although An18g00510 is adjacent to pyrA in the A. niger genome, its P. thymicola homolog has three genes separating it from pyrA in the P. thymicola genome, and was predicted to not be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis (Tang et al., 2018). To investigate these observations and identify genes encoding pyranonigrin A biosynthetic tailoring enzymes, we generated a gene deletion library to identify the genes involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis.

To circumvent this, we first generated CW12006, a JSC-093350089 mutant strain deficient in AlbA, and therefore also deficient in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. The AfpyrG gene was then recycled (Supplementary Figure S3) to enable the generation of additional deletion mutations in CW12007. Next, we used CW12007 to individually delete 5 genes surrounding pyrA and generate a pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster mutant library with albA- genetic background. The deletant strains were cultured in pyranonigrin A-producing conditions and their SM production was analyzed using HPLC-DAD-MS (Figure 2B). Deletion strains CW12009, CW12010, and CW12011, which had An18g00490, An18g00500, and An18g00510 deleted, respectively, resulted in the complete elimination of pyranonigrin A, which confirmed their involvement in its biosynthesis. Deletion strains CW12008 and CW12013, which had An18g00480 and An18g00530 deleted, respectively, resulted in unchanged SM profiles, which indicated that these two genes are not involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. These results suggest that the pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster includes pyrA, pyrB, pyrC, and An18g00510, which we designated as pyrE (Figure 2A and Table 1). These findings are in contrast to the recent study conducted in P. thymicola, which did not include pyrE in the proposed pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster (Tang et al., 2018). In this study, heterologous expression of the suspected pyr cluster and adjacent genes, which included pyrE, led to production of pyranonigrin A. However, pyrE (orf2) was excluded from the proposed pathway because it was found to not be expressed with the rest of the cluster in pyranonigrin A-producing conditions. Our data indicates that pyrE is involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which as an oxidoreductase may be responsible for the final dehydrogenation or hydroxylation step, which were previously proposed to both be carried out by pyrB. This does not exclude the potential involvement of pyrD in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which was found by Tang et al. (2018) to be co-regulated with pyrA-pyrC and was suggested to be involved in tetramic acid formation. Genetic Variant Analysis of Clusters Producing SMs That Exhibit Increased Production Levels in JSC-093350089 Having identified the genes responsible for pyranonigrin A production in A. niger, we next conducted a genome-level analysis to investigate potential reasons for the enhanced pyranonigrin A production levels in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015. For this analysis, we also investigated genes involved in the production of kotanin, pestalamide B, and albA pathway SMs (aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones), all of which also featured increased production levels in JSC-093350089 (Figure 1). The biosynthetic gene cluster for kotanin has been identified in A. niger, and includes genes encoding non-reducing-PKS (NR-PKS) ktnS, O-methytransferase ktnB, cytochrome P450 ktnC, and flavine-binding monooxygenase ktnD (Gil Girol et al., 2012). The biosynthetic gene cluster for pestalamide A was recently elucidated following deletion of the histone acetyltransferase gcnE, which led to production of pestalamide A as well as other SMs (Wang et al., 2018). Pestalamide A is a 4H-pyran-4-one derivative of pestalamide B, and therefore pestalamide B is likely formed from the same cluster as pestalamide A. This cluster harbors genes encoding NR-PKS epaA, ferulate:CoA ligase epaB, acyl-CoA transferase epaC, oxidoreductase orf1, 3-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydoxylase orf2, and salicylate hydroxylase orf3. Naphtho-γ-pyrones, including the aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones, are biosynthesized by albA, which encodes a PKS that is also crucial for melanin production (Chiang et al., 2011). Tailoring enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these naphtho-γ-pyrones are not clustered with albA and have not been identified. With this information at hand, we set out to identify SNPs and INDELs occurring in SM cluster regions in JSC-093350089 when compared to ATCC 1015. To accomplish this, JSC-093350089 paired-end reads, obtained from a previous study (Romsdahl et al., 2018), were aligned to the ATCC 1015 reference genome, which resulted in the identification of 5264 SNPs (Supplementary Table S4) and 47446 INDELs (Supplementary Table S5). Variants occurring within the pyr, ktn, and epa clusters and near the albA gene are displayed in Table 2. Within the pyr cluster, no variants were observed within the coding sequence (CDS) or in the upstream intergenic promoter region. One INDEL was identified downstream of the pyrA gene. Two INDEL variations were also observed in pyrC introns, and the region downstream of the pyrC gene was highly variable compared to ATCC 1015, harboring 19 INDELs. TABLE 2.

One synonymous and two missense SNPs were observed within ktnD, and 3 deletions were observed in the ktnD upstream intergenic region 339, 458, and 555 bps away from the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Notably, the second of these deletions, which featured a loss of 13 bps, was predicted to be within the promoter region (genomic coordinates 23456–23311) using PromPredict, which predicts promoter regions based on DNA duplex stability and has been verified across a broad range of eukaryotic genomes (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010; Yella et al., 2018). Other variations occurring within the ktn cluster included 3 SNPs within the intron region of ktnA. Many variants were observed within the pestalamide biosynthetic gene cluster, including two missense SNPs within epaA, whose gene product was proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2018). INDELs were observed within the 3′ UTR of epaB, and in both the 5′ and 3′ UTR of orf1. Additionally, intergenic INDELs were observed upstream of epaC, orf1, and orf3, and downstream of epaA, epaC, and orf2. One synonymous SNP was observed within PKS-encoding albA, along with a 2 bp insertion in the downstream intergenic region. Genetic Variant Analysis of SM Cluster Regulators Next, we turned our attention to variations occurring in genes known to regulate the SMs that exhibited differential production in JSC-093350089, as variations in these genes may explain increased SM production levels. The transcription factor Fum21 has been reported to play a role in both pyranonigrin A and fumonisin production, with Fum21 deficiency resulting in a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production (Aerts et al., 2018). Fum21 is regulated by FlbA, which is a regulator of G-protein signaling and plays a major role in sporulation (Krijgsheld et al., 2013). While the only variant associated with fum21 was a downstream intergenic INDEL, several genetic variants within the flbA promoter (genomic coordinates 815849-815999) were observed, including a 16 bp insertion, a 7 bp deletion, and a 6 bp deletion (Table 3). Our investigation also revealed one splice region insertion and two intergenic INDELs downstream of flbA. TABLE 3.

Our analysis revealed an upstream intergenic SNP 26 bps away from the CDS start codon, as well as a deletion in the intron region and an insertion in the downstream intergenic region (Table 3). Finally, we turned our attention to azaR, which is harbored within the pestalamide biosynthetic gene cluster and encodes a pathway-specific transcription factor (Zabala et al., 2012). We identified an insertion 222 bps away from the CDS start codon, along with a synonymous SNP and 2 downstream intergenic INDELs (Table 3). Assessment of the UV Resistance Potential of Pyranonigrin A We hypothesized that the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate played a role in protecting the strain from the high levels of radiation present in the spacecraft. This hypothesis was evaluated by comparing the UV sensitivity of pyranonigrin A-producing JSC-093350089 to pyranonigrin A-deficient JSC-093350089. It has been reported that kusA deletion significantly enhances the sensitivity of A. niger to UV exposure (Meyer et al., 2007). Therefore, to investigate whether pyranonigrin A confers UV resistance to A. niger, the kusA gene was first reintegrated into the pyrA- deletion strain (CW12005) to generate CW12015. Next, the JSC-093350089 WT and pyrA- strains were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation ranging from 5–25 mJ/cm2 in triplicate. The results indicated that pyranonigrin A deficiency significantly reduces the viability of UV-exposed strains at doses greater than 15 mJ/cm2 (Figure 3). The effect became more pronounced as the radiation dose increased, with an approximate viability reduction of 34% observed at 15 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), 43% observed at 20 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), and 68% observed at 25 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.0002). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Percent survival following exposure to varying doses of UVC radiation for JSC-093350089 WT and JSC-093350089 pyrA- (CW12005). *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Although the persistence of A. niger in spacecraft (Pierson et al., 2013; Checinska et al., 2015) has been well-documented, few studies have investigated how spacecraft conditions alter its SM production. Metabolomic characterization combined with genetic analysis of A. niger strains that have inhabited spacecraft can provide valuable information about SM-based adaptation mechanisms of fungi capable of surviving in such environments. Additionally, despite a substantial effort to map fungal SMs to their biosynthesis genes, most clusters remain unlinked to their final product, which, in many cases, is due to the low production levels of many metabolites. There is therefore significant potential in analyzing SM production in fungal species isolated from various extreme environments, as such conditions may naturally optimize production yields of useful SMs, thereby reducing the cost of laborious laboratory-based optimization. Metabolomic analysis of the A. niger laboratory strain and ISS isolate revealed significant differences in SM production levels. This finding is not surprising given the unique stresses associated with spaceflight and the fact that SM production is an evolutionary-derived trait to confer selective advantage in distinct ecological niches (Brakhage, 2013). While a recent study found that growth in ISS conditions is capable of altering SM production in Aspergillus nidulans (Romsdahl et al., 2019), the metabolomic changes encountered in JSC-093350089, which are conserved on Earth, are likely the result of a substantial changes at the genomic or epigenomic level, which may have been selected for by pressures associated with ISS conditions, such as microgravity, enhanced radiation, and low nutrient availability. Interestingly, the spaceflight environment appeared to select for a strain that produces enhanced levels of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A (Hiort et al., 2004), the antimicrobial aurasperone A (Shaaban et al., 2012), and the antifungal and antioxidant aurasperone B (Choque et al., 2015). Perhaps the most significant observation was enhanced production of pyranonigrin A in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015, which only produces the SM at basal levels. On the ISS, radiation capable of penetrating the spacecraft generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) within biological systems (Gabani and Singh, 2013). Oxidative stress occurs when ROS overwhelm an organism’s antioxidant defense mechanisms, resulting in the generation of oxidative damage among DNA, proteins, lipids, and other vital cell components (Lehnert and Iyer, 2002; Gabani and Singh, 2013). Antioxidants have enormous therapeutic potential, as they neutralize the harmful effects of ROS, which can cause or exacerbate a range of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (Firuzi et al., 2011). Examination of metabolic reserves of fungi isolated from enhanced radiation environments therefore provides a means of identifying fungal strains that produce optimized levels of specific therapeutics, as illustrated by this study. Further, investigation into the underlying genetics that may be responsible for increased production of bioactive compounds provides a useful starting point for future production yield optimization efforts. We suspected that the conserved increase in some SM production levels may be due to variations within genomic regions that commonly possess regulatory elements, such as the promoter, the 5′ UTR, or the 3′ UTR. This was investigated by performing a comparative genetic analysis of SM clusters and regulators. This initially required identification of the pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster in A. niger, which has a different genetic architecture than the cluster identified in P. thymicola (Supplementary Figure S9; Tang et al., 2018). While confirming the involvement of these genes in A. niger, we identified an additional cluster gene, pyrE, that was previously reported to not be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we did not identify any variants within the pyr cluster that could clearly explain the significant increase in pyranonigrin A production in the ISS strain. We therefore extended our study to include genes encoding products known to regulate pyranonigrin A. Thus far, this is limited to the transcription factor Fum21, which is regulated by FlbA, a regulator of G-protein signaling that plays a critical role in sporulation and whose deficiency results in thin cell walls and cell lysis (Krijgsheld et al., 2013; Aerts et al., 2018). It has been reported that Fum21 deficiency leads to downregulation of genes from 4 different SM clusters, accompanied by a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production (Aerts et al., 2018). Although we did not identify any critical mutation within/near fum21, our investigation revealed 3 INDELs that account for the modification of 29 bps within the promoter region of flbA. It is highly probable that these mutations could lead to altered regulation of FlbA, which may help explain the dramatic increase in pyranonigrin A production in the ISS strain. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm this possibility, and to explore the potential impact of the observed promoter-region mutations on other biological processes within A. niger, such as sporulation and cell wall structure, as such studies may provide insight into why these variations may be favorable in ISS conditions. On the other hand, increased pyranonigrin A production levels may also be the result of differences at the epigenetic level, which would be an interesting avenue to explore but was outside the scope of this investigation. Second only to pyranonigrin A, kotanin exhibited a 10-fold increase in production levels in JSC-093350089. Within its biosynthetic gene cluster, mutations were observed within ktnD that could have altered both its regulation and activity, including a 13 bp deletion within the promoter region and 2 missense mutations. It is unclear whether altered regulation of ktnD could explain the increase in kotanin production levels, as the specific role of KtnD, a monooxygenase, in the biosynthesis of kotanin has not been determined, and KtnS was proposed to be the rate-limiting step in the pathway (Gil Girol et al., 2012). Within the pestalamide biosynthetic cluster, several mutations were observed which may explain its twofold increase in production in the ISS strain. Two missense mutations were observed within the gene encoding EpaA, the NR-PKS proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis. Notably, INDELs were observed within the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR of orf1. UTRs often contain regulatory elements that play key roles in appropriate expression of a gene, and therefore the observed variation may be responsible for altered regulatory patterns of orf1, which encodes for an oxidoreductase. The gene product of orf1, also known as AzaJ, is also involved in the biosynthesis of the azanigerones, which are produced by the same cluster as the pestalamides (Zabala et al., 2012). In azanigerone biosynthesis, AzaJ is proposed to catalyze the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, partially facilitating the transformation of azanigerone C to azanigerone A. In pestalamide biosynthesis, AzaJ was proposed to be involved in the generation of the intermediate carbonarone A from the polyketide precursor, which involves oxidation and transamination (Wang et al., 2018). Further studies need to be performed to determine if this step in the pathway is rate-limiting, and if altered expression of azaJ could be responsible for the increase in pestalamide production levels. Another potentially significant mutation that we observed was an insertion in the 3′ UTR of epaB, which encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that may catalyze the formation of 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA, as it plays a similar role in the azanigerone pathway. 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA is then used as a substrate by EpaC followed by cyclization to form pestalamide. Further experiments should be performed to confirm whether the observed 3′ UTR variant alters expression levels of epaB, which then leads to altered pestalamide production levels. Next, we investigated genetic variants associated with genes encoding known regulators of pestalamide, including the pathway-specific transcription factor AzaR and the epigenetic regulator GcnE (Zabala et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018). However, this analysis did not reveal any substantial findings; while both genes possess upstream intergenic variants in JSC-093350089, they were predicted to outside the promoter region. It is reasonable to presume that enhanced production of molecules that confer oxidative stress resistance is a key adaptive characteristic of fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments, as this has been observed among other species (Baqai et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2011). This may explain the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate, and is supported by the UV resistance study, which suggests that pyranonigrin A plays a role in conferring radiation resistance in A. niger. Additionally, we observed a cumulative increase in the production of naphtho-γ-pyrones, which are produced by AlbA, the same PKS responsible for 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) biosynthesis. This stays in agreement with the observed enrichment of AlbA in the proteome of JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Such observations suggest that the ISS isolate produces enhanced levels of DHN-melanin, and is consistent with previous reports that fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments produce enhanced levels of melanin (Singaravelan et al., 2008). In microbial systems, melanin functions as a UV-protectant, an antioxidant, a thermoregulator, and as a toxin-sequestering agent (Cordero and Casadevall, 2017). It is therefore reasonable to presume that increased melanin production may be an adaptive feature that is selected for by spaceflight environments. We were unable to identify any mutations associated with albA that may explain its upregulation and the associated increase in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. Additionally, we could not investigate variants occurring in naphtho-γ-pyrone tailoring enzymes, as those genes are not clustered with albA and have not yet been characterized. Further, as discussed before with regard to the pestalamides, while production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones were reported to increase following deletion of the epigenetic regulator gcnE, we did not identify any mutations associated with gcnE that may explain increased production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones. In summary, this investigation revealed the distinct metabolomic fingerprint of a melanized fungal species capable of withstanding ISS conditions, which featured enhanced production of a molecule with antioxidant and UV-protective properties. Genetic analysis revealed variants that may be responsible for the observed increase in SM production levels. These findings illustrate the therapeutic and economic potential associated with investigating metabolite production in microbes isolated from extreme environments and provide a framework for future efforts to genetically optimize production yields of the bioactive SMs described in this study.",

Copyright notice ID: 7326050 PMID: 32670208 Abstract Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate. Keywords: secondary metabolites, Aspergillus niger, International Space Station, pyranonigrin A, antioxidantIntroduction Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo (Pierson, 2001; Novikova et al., 2006; Van Houdt et al., 2012). Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system (Pierson, 2001; Sonnenfeld et al., 2003). Additionally, several studies have indicated that spacecraft environments increase microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance (Tixador et al., 1985; Wilson et al., 2007, 2008). As we make strides toward human interplanetary exploration, investigations into the characteristics of filamentous fungi that reside in spacecraft environments are critical for crew health. Additionally, such studies present diverse industrial and therapeutic opportunities, as fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to external stressors. These small molecules often kill or inhibit growth of other organisms, enabling fungi to successfully compete within the complex ecosystem they reside in. While some SMs are toxic to humans, others have diverse industrial and therapeutic applications, including antibiotic, anticancer, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and cholesterol-lowering activities (Newman and Cragg, 2012). The remarkable structural and functional diversity of fungal SMs arise from the combinatorial and modular nature of their biosynthesis, in which the SM core backbone is biosynthesized by a core synthase enzyme, such as a polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), or a hybrid PKS-NRPS, and further diversified by a number of tailoring enzymes that are clustered together within the genome (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006). In order to understand the characteristics of microbes residing in the International Space Station (ISS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has implemented a robust microbial monitoring system (Pierson et al., 2013). The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has been reported to be a predominant ISS isolate (Checinska et al., 2015), and is frequently detected in other built environments (Haleem Khan and Mohan Karuppayil, 2012; Varga et al., 2014). A. niger is a melanized fungal species commonly used in the biotech industry as a production host for citric acid and enzymes (Schuster et al., 2002). Melanized fungi are commonly isolated from highly irradiated environments (Singaravelan et al., 2008; Selbmann et al., 2015), and it has been reported that the electronic properties of melanin change following exposure to ionizing radiation (Dadachova et al., 2007). Additionally, several studies have reported the association of melanin production with fungal virulence (Kwon-Chung et al., 1982; Wang et al., 1995; Nosanchuk et al., 1998). Together, these findings demonstrate the need for studies that assess the characteristics of melanized fungi inhabiting spacecraft environments. Naphtho-γ-pyrones are the predominant class of SMs produced by A. niger, and they possess a diverse array of reported biological properties, including anti-HIV, anti-hyperuricemia, anti-tubercular, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant activities (Choque et al., 2015). Advances in genome sequencing of A. niger have revealed its capacity to produce many other SMs in addition to the naphtho-γ-pyrones, as its genome harbors 46 PKSs, 35 NRPSs, and 9 NRPS-PKS hybrid genes (Romsdahl and Wang, 2019). Many of these SM biosynthesis genes are silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions, which has resulted in a lack of studies on SMs that may have useful industrial and therapeutic properties. Given that fungi produce SMs in response to environmental stress, investigations into SM production of A. niger strains isolated from space environments may reveal enhanced production levels of bioactive molecules and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Here, we report the SM production of JSC-093350089, a previously described strain of A. niger isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Our analysis revealed that the ISS isolate produces high levels of the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), along with other bioactive SMs, such as kotanin, pestalamide B, and naphtho-γ-pyrones, when compared to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. To investigate differences between the strains that may explain the increased production of some SMs in JSC-093350089, we conducted a comparative genetic analysis of biosynthesis clusters and regulators of differentially produced SMs. Finally, the UV resistance potential of pyranonigrin A was assessed.Materials and Methods Secondary Metabolite Extraction and Analysis JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates, starting with 1 × 107 spores per Petri dish (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 25 ml methanol (MeOH), followed by 25 ml 1:1 MeOH-dichloromethane, each with 1 h of sonication and filtration. The extract was evaporated in vacuo and re-dissolved in 2 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in MeOH and a portion (10 μl) was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 μm; 2.1 by 100 mm; Alltech Prevail) at a flow rate of 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for HPLC-DAD-MS was 95% MeCN/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with solvent B from 45 to 50 min.Strains and Molecular Manipulations The A. niger wild-type and mutant strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1, primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2, and diagnostic PCR results are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Deletion cassettes were generated using the double joint PCR technique (Supplementary Figure S2; Yu et al., 2004). DNA insertions into the A. niger genome were performed using protoplasts and standard PEG transformation. To develop an efficient gene targeting system in JSC-093350089, the kusA gene was first deleted by replacing it with the hygromycin resistance marker (hph). The two amplified flanking sequences and the hygromycin phosphortransferase gene (hph) marker cassette amplified from pCB1003 (Fungal Genetics Stock Center) were fused together into one construct by fusion PCR using nested primers, and the mutation was selected for by growth on media containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Diagnostic PCR was performed on the deletant strain using external primers (P1 and P6) from the first round of PCR. The difference in size between the gene replaced by the selection marker and the native gene allowed us to determine whether the transformants carried the correct gene replacement. Next, an auxotrophic mutant in the kusA- background was generated by deleting the pyrG gene. Two ∼1500 base pair fragments upstream and downstream of pyrG were amplified and fused together (Supplementary Figure S3). The mutation was selected for by growth on media supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), as only cells lacking the pyrG gene can survive when 5-FOA is present. The correct transformants were identified by performing diagnostic PCR on the deletant strain using external primers (P1 and P6) from the first round of PCR. All other deletant strains were generated by replacing each target gene with the A. fumigatus pyrG gene (AfpyrG). Double deletion mutants were generated by recycling the AfpyrG gene in CW12006. This involved amplifying two ∼1500 base pair fragments upstream and downstream from the alba::AfpyrG region of JSC-093350089 albAΔ genome, which were then fused together. The mutation was selected for by growth on media supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of 5-FOA. Correct transformants were identified using diagnostic PCR with external and internal primers (P1 and AfpyrG rev; AfpyrG Fw and P6). To reintegrate the kusA gene into the genome of CW12005, the AfpyrG gene used to initially delete pyrA was deleted according to the strategy described in Supplementary Figure S3, which generated CW12014. The kusA gene was amplified from JSC-093350089 gDNA to include ∼1500 base pair fragment upstream and ∼500 bp fragment downstream from kusA. This fragment was then fused to the AfpyrG gene and the original 3′ region amplified for initial kusA deletion (Supplementary Figure S4). The kusA was reintegrated into the genome of CW12014 to generate CW12015. Correct transformants were identified using diagnostic PCR with external primers (P1 and P6).Genetic Variant Analysis Paired-end Illumina sequence reads, obtained from a previous study (Romsdahl et al., 2018), were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) and quality was checked using FastQC v 0.11.7 (Andrews, 2010). The A. niger ATCC 1015 genome and annotation files were downloaded from the FungiDB web portal (Stajich et al., 2012). Trimmed reads were mapped to the ATCC 1015 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package v 0.7.17 (Li and Durbin, 2009). Mapped read files were further processed using SAMtools v 1.9 (Li et al., 2009) and PCR artifacts were removed using Picard tools MarkDuplicates1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were identified using GATK v 3.8.7 (McKenna et al., 2010). Sequence reads containing putative INDELs were realigned using GATK’s IndelRealigner and variants within each sample were called using GATK’s Haplotype Caller. GATK’s VariantFiltration was used to filter the resulting Variant Call Format (VCF) file using stringent cutoffs for quality and coverage {SNPs: QD < 2.0, MQ < 40.0, QUAL < 100, FS > 60.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4.0, ReadPosRankSum < −8.0; INDELs: QD < 2.0, FS > 200.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4, InbreedingCoeff < −0.8, ReadPosRankSum < −20.0}, so that only high-quality variants remained. PromPredict was used to predict if any upstream intergenic variants within 1000 bps of the coding sequence (CDS) occurred within the promoter region (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010; Yella et al., 2018).UVC Resistance Analysis UVC radiation resistance was assessed using JSC-093350089 WT and CW12015. Both strains were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates by seeding 1 × 107 spores per Petri dish (D = 10 cm). Spores were collected after 5 days of growth and counted. An equal amount of spores were resuspended in 5 ml of GMM agar and poured onto Petri dishes consisting of 20 ml GMM agar. Mycelia-containing plates were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation in triplicate using a CL-1000 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (UVP, Inc.).Results Secondary Metabolite Analysis of JSC-093350089 SM profiles of JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were examined after growth on GMM agar medium using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). SMs were identified based on mass, UV-Vis absorption, and retention time (Supplementary Figure S5), which were in good agreement with literature (Chiang et al., 2011). The identity of pyranonigrin A was further verified by purchasing the pure compound from Enzo Life Sciences (Supplementary Figure S6). The data revealed that each strain produced a distinct SM profile, with the production yield of most SMs significantly altered (Figure 1A). Production yield analysis was carried out for each SM (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S7). Compared to ATCC 1015, a significant decrease in the production of nigragillin, an insecticide (Isogai et al., 1975), was observed (P = 0.0001). The most significant difference was observed with the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), highlighted in purple in Figure 1A, which exhibited a 6000% increase in production in JSC-093350089 (P = 0.04), as it was produced at basal levels in ATCC 1015. Nigerazine B displayed no statistical difference in production levels (P = 0.06). In the ISS strain, pestalamide B production was approximately 2 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03), and bicoumanigrin, which was reported to have cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines (Hiort et al., 2004), exhibited a production yield 2.5 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.01). Kotanin production in the ISS strain was approximately 10 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03). FIGURE 1.

Each individual metabolite’s production yield is reported as increased, decreased, or no change, compared to that of ATCC 1015. Pyranonigrin A is highlighted in purple and albA pathway SMs are highlighted in green.

Significance was determined using Welch’s t-test. *P ≤ 0.05; ****P ≤ 0.0001.The majority of SMs produced were identified as naphtho-γ-pyrones, including aurasperone A, B, and C, fonsecinone A, B, and C, a fonsecinone C derivative, and asperpyrone B and C. These SMs, highlighted in green in Figure 1A, are biosynthesized by the PKS AlbA (Chiang et al., 2011). The molecular formula of the final SM, labeled as peak 6 in Figure 1A, was predicted using high-resolution mass spectrometry, and a thorough literature search revealed that no known A. niger SM matched this formula. This SM was later determined to also be biosynthesized by the albA pathway when A. niger devoid of AlbA failed to produce the unknown compound. The combined production yields of albA pathway SMs were approximately 2.5 times higher in the ISS stain compared to ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03).Analysis of the Potential Gene Clusters Responsible for Production of Pyranonigrin A in silico To facilitate a more detailed analysis of the underlying genetics that may have led to enhanced production of pyranonigrin A in JSC-093350089, we set out to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster in A. niger. First, we searched for the core backbone synthase gene involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. The biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin E, a SM very similar to pyranonigrin A, was recently proposed and pynA (An11g00250) was identified as the PKS-NRPS hybrid involved in its biosynthesis (Awakawa et al., 2013). We hypothesized that pyranonigrin A is either biosynthesized by the same cluster responsible for pyranonigrin E production, or by a different cluster harboring a PKS-NRPS hybrid gene similar to pynA. The genome of ATCC 1015 possesses 8 PKS-NRPS hybrid genes other than pynA. BLAST analysis was performed using the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) MycoCosm database (Grigoriev et al., 2014) on the 8 remaining PKS-NRPS hybrids to determine which genes possessed high sequence homology to pynA. The results revealed that An18g00520 (pyrA) possessed high sequence similarity to pynA, with 53.4% sequence identity and 89.8% subject coverage (Supplementary Table S3).Development of an Efficient Gene Targeting System in JSC-093350089 and Identification of the PKS-NRPS Hybrid Responsible for Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis To determine which of the two putative PKS-NRPS hybrids is involved in the biosynthesis of pyranonigrin A, a genetic system was developed in JSC-093350089. The kusA gene was first deleted to decrease the rate of nonhomologous integration of transforming DNA fragments, thereby improving gene targeting efficiency (Meyer et al., 2007). Next, the pyrG gene was deleted in the kusA- background to generate CW12003, an auxotrophic mutant that requires uracil and uridine supplementation (Arentshorst et al., 2015). CW12003 was then used to generate mutant strains CW12004 and CW12005, which had the pynA gene and An18g00520 genes deleted, respectively. JSC-093350089 and the two mutant strains were then cultured on GMM, and SMs were extracted following 5 days of growth and subjected to HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Observation of SM traces as detected by UV-Vis total scan and mass spectroscopy in positive ion mode [M+H]+ m/z = 224 revealed pyranonigrin A production in pynA- (CW12004) and the complete elimination of pyranonigrin A in An18g00520- (CW12005) (Supplementary Figure S8), indicating that An18g00520 is responsible for the production of pyranonigrin A. This finding was recently confirmed in Penicillium thymicola and reported while our work was being completed (Tang et al., 2018).Identification of Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Next, we aimed to identify additional genes involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. To accomplish this, we identified genes surrounding pyrA (Figure 2A and Table 1), as the genes involved in fungal SM biosynthesis are usually clustered in the genome (Keller et al., 2005). Interestingly, when we compared the genes surrounding pyrA in A. niger to their homologs in P. thymicola using the JGI MycoCosm database (Grigoriev et al., 2014), we noticed that the distribution of genes surrounding pyrA differed between the P. thymicola and A. niger genomes (Supplementary Figure S9; Tang et al., 2018). For example, pyrD, a hydrolase predicted to be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis in P. thymicola, is adjacent to pyrC in the P. thymicola genome and has only two genes separating it from pyrA. However, its homolog within the A. niger genome, An18g00470, is adjacent to An18g00480 and has four genes separating it from pyrA. Similarly, although An18g00510 is adjacent to pyrA in the A. niger genome, its P. thymicola homolog has three genes separating it from pyrA in the P. thymicola genome, and was predicted to not be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis (Tang et al., 2018). To investigate these observations and identify genes encoding pyranonigrin A biosynthetic tailoring enzymes, we generated a gene deletion library to identify the genes involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis.

To circumvent this, we first generated CW12006, a JSC-093350089 mutant strain deficient in AlbA, and therefore also deficient in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. The AfpyrG gene was then recycled (Supplementary Figure S3) to enable the generation of additional deletion mutations in CW12007. Next, we used CW12007 to individually delete 5 genes surrounding pyrA and generate a pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster mutant library with albA- genetic background. The deletant strains were cultured in pyranonigrin A-producing conditions and their SM production was analyzed using HPLC-DAD-MS (Figure 2B). Deletion strains CW12009, CW12010, and CW12011, which had An18g00490, An18g00500, and An18g00510 deleted, respectively, resulted in the complete elimination of pyranonigrin A, which confirmed their involvement in its biosynthesis. Deletion strains CW12008 and CW12013, which had An18g00480 and An18g00530 deleted, respectively, resulted in unchanged SM profiles, which indicated that these two genes are not involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. These results suggest that the pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster includes pyrA, pyrB, pyrC, and An18g00510, which we designated as pyrE (Figure 2A and Table 1). These findings are in contrast to the recent study conducted in P. thymicola, which did not include pyrE in the proposed pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster (Tang et al., 2018). In this study, heterologous expression of the suspected pyr cluster and adjacent genes, which included pyrE, led to production of pyranonigrin A. However, pyrE (orf2) was excluded from the proposed pathway because it was found to not be expressed with the rest of the cluster in pyranonigrin A-producing conditions. Our data indicates that pyrE is involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which as an oxidoreductase may be responsible for the final dehydrogenation or hydroxylation step, which were previously proposed to both be carried out by pyrB. This does not exclude the potential involvement of pyrD in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which was found by Tang et al. (2018) to be co-regulated with pyrA-pyrC and was suggested to be involved in tetramic acid formation.Genetic Variant Analysis of Clusters Producing SMs That Exhibit Increased Production Levels in JSC-093350089 Having identified the genes responsible for pyranonigrin A production in A. niger, we next conducted a genome-level analysis to investigate potential reasons for the enhanced pyranonigrin A production levels in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015. For this analysis, we also investigated genes involved in the production of kotanin, pestalamide B, and albA pathway SMs (aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones), all of which also featured increased production levels in JSC-093350089 (Figure 1). The biosynthetic gene cluster for kotanin has been identified in A. niger, and includes genes encoding non-reducing-PKS (NR-PKS) ktnS, O-methytransferase ktnB, cytochrome P450 ktnC, and flavine-binding monooxygenase ktnD (Gil Girol et al., 2012). The biosynthetic gene cluster for pestalamide A was recently elucidated following deletion of the histone acetyltransferase gcnE, which led to production of pestalamide A as well as other SMs (Wang et al., 2018). Pestalamide A is a 4H-pyran-4-one derivative of pestalamide B, and therefore pestalamide B is likely formed from the same cluster as pestalamide A. This cluster harbors genes encoding NR-PKS epaA, ferulate:CoA ligase epaB, acyl-CoA transferase epaC, oxidoreductase orf1, 3-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydoxylase orf2, and salicylate hydroxylase orf3. Naphtho-γ-pyrones, including the aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones, are biosynthesized by albA, which encodes a PKS that is also crucial for melanin production (Chiang et al., 2011). Tailoring enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these naphtho-γ-pyrones are not clustered with albA and have not been identified. With this information at hand, we set out to identify SNPs and INDELs occurring in SM cluster regions in JSC-093350089 when compared to ATCC 1015. To accomplish this, JSC-093350089 paired-end reads, obtained from a previous study (Romsdahl et al., 2018), were aligned to the ATCC 1015 reference genome, which resulted in the identification of 5264 SNPs (Supplementary Table S4) and 47446 INDELs (Supplementary Table S5). Variants occurring within the pyr, ktn, and epa clusters and near the albA gene are displayed in Table 2. Within the pyr cluster, no variants were observed within the coding sequence (CDS) or in the upstream intergenic promoter region. One INDEL was identified downstream of the pyrA gene. Two INDEL variations were also observed in pyrC introns, and the region downstream of the pyrC gene was highly variable compared to ATCC 1015, harboring 19 INDELs. TABLE 2.

One synonymous and two missense SNPs were observed within ktnD, and 3 deletions were observed in the ktnD upstream intergenic region 339, 458, and 555 bps away from the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Notably, the second of these deletions, which featured a loss of 13 bps, was predicted to be within the promoter region (genomic coordinates 23456–23311) using PromPredict, which predicts promoter regions based on DNA duplex stability and has been verified across a broad range of eukaryotic genomes (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010; Yella et al., 2018). Other variations occurring within the ktn cluster included 3 SNPs within the intron region of ktnA. Many variants were observed within the pestalamide biosynthetic gene cluster, including two missense SNPs within epaA, whose gene product was proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2018). INDELs were observed within the 3′ UTR of epaB, and in both the 5′ and 3′ UTR of orf1. Additionally, intergenic INDELs were observed upstream of epaC, orf1, and orf3, and downstream of epaA, epaC, and orf2. One synonymous SNP was observed within PKS-encoding albA, along with a 2 bp insertion in the downstream intergenic region.Genetic Variant Analysis of SM Cluster Regulators Next, we turned our attention to variations occurring in genes known to regulate the SMs that exhibited differential production in JSC-093350089, as variations in these genes may explain increased SM production levels. The transcription factor Fum21 has been reported to play a role in both pyranonigrin A and fumonisin production, with Fum21 deficiency resulting in a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production (Aerts et al., 2018). Fum21 is regulated by FlbA, which is a regulator of G-protein signaling and plays a major role in sporulation (Krijgsheld et al., 2013). While the only variant associated with fum21 was a downstream intergenic INDEL, several genetic variants within the flbA promoter (genomic coordinates 815849-815999) were observed, including a 16 bp insertion, a 7 bp deletion, and a 6 bp deletion (Table 3). Our investigation also revealed one splice region insertion and two intergenic INDELs downstream of flbA. TABLE 3.

Our analysis revealed an upstream intergenic SNP 26 bps away from the CDS start codon, as well as a deletion in the intron region and an insertion in the downstream intergenic region (Table 3). Finally, we turned our attention to azaR, which is harbored within the pestalamide biosynthetic gene cluster and encodes a pathway-specific transcription factor (Zabala et al., 2012). We identified an insertion 222 bps away from the CDS start codon, along with a synonymous SNP and 2 downstream intergenic INDELs (Table 3).Assessment of the UV Resistance Potential of Pyranonigrin A We hypothesized that the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate played a role in protecting the strain from the high levels of radiation present in the spacecraft. This hypothesis was evaluated by comparing the UV sensitivity of pyranonigrin A-producing JSC-093350089 to pyranonigrin A-deficient JSC-093350089. It has been reported that kusA deletion significantly enhances the sensitivity of A. niger to UV exposure (Meyer et al., 2007). Therefore, to investigate whether pyranonigrin A confers UV resistance to A. niger, the kusA gene was first reintegrated into the pyrA- deletion strain (CW12005) to generate CW12015. Next, the JSC-093350089 WT and pyrA- strains were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation ranging from 5–25 mJ/cm2 in triplicate. The results indicated that pyranonigrin A deficiency significantly reduces the viability of UV-exposed strains at doses greater than 15 mJ/cm2 (Figure 3). The effect became more pronounced as the radiation dose increased, with an approximate viability reduction of 34% observed at 15 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), 43% observed at 20 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), and 68% observed at 25 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.0002). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Percent survival following exposure to varying doses of UVC radiation for JSC-093350089 WT and JSC-093350089 pyrA- (CW12005). *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01.Discussion Although the persistence of A. niger in spacecraft (Pierson et al., 2013; Checinska et al., 2015) has been well-documented, few studies have investigated how spacecraft conditions alter its SM production. Metabolomic characterization combined with genetic analysis of A. niger strains that have inhabited spacecraft can provide valuable information about SM-based adaptation mechanisms of fungi capable of surviving in such environments. Additionally, despite a substantial effort to map fungal SMs to their biosynthesis genes, most clusters remain unlinked to their final product, which, in many cases, is due to the low production levels of many metabolites. There is therefore significant potential in analyzing SM production in fungal species isolated from various extreme environments, as such conditions may naturally optimize production yields of useful SMs, thereby reducing the cost of laborious laboratory-based optimization. Metabolomic analysis of the A. niger laboratory strain and ISS isolate revealed significant differences in SM production levels. This finding is not surprising given the unique stresses associated with spaceflight and the fact that SM production is an evolutionary-derived trait to confer selective advantage in distinct ecological niches (Brakhage, 2013). While a recent study found that growth in ISS conditions is capable of altering SM production in Aspergillus nidulans (Romsdahl et al., 2019), the metabolomic changes encountered in JSC-093350089, which are conserved on Earth, are likely the result of a substantial changes at the genomic or epigenomic level, which may have been selected for by pressures associated with ISS conditions, such as microgravity, enhanced radiation, and low nutrient availability. Interestingly, the spaceflight environment appeared to select for a strain that produces enhanced levels of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A (Hiort et al., 2004), the antimicrobial aurasperone A (Shaaban et al., 2012), and the antifungal and antioxidant aurasperone B (Choque et al., 2015). Perhaps the most significant observation was enhanced production of pyranonigrin A in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015, which only produces the SM at basal levels. On the ISS, radiation capable of penetrating the spacecraft generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) within biological systems (Gabani and Singh, 2013). Oxidative stress occurs when ROS overwhelm an organism’s antioxidant defense mechanisms, resulting in the generation of oxidative damage among DNA, proteins, lipids, and other vital cell components (Lehnert and Iyer, 2002; Gabani and Singh, 2013). Antioxidants have enormous therapeutic potential, as they neutralize the harmful effects of ROS, which can cause or exacerbate a range of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (Firuzi et al., 2011). Examination of metabolic reserves of fungi isolated from enhanced radiation environments therefore provides a means of identifying fungal strains that produce optimized levels of specific therapeutics, as illustrated by this study. Further, investigation into the underlying genetics that may be responsible for increased production of bioactive compounds provides a useful starting point for future production yield optimization efforts. We suspected that the conserved increase in some SM production levels may be due to variations within genomic regions that commonly possess regulatory elements, such as the promoter, the 5′ UTR, or the 3′ UTR. This was investigated by performing a comparative genetic analysis of SM clusters and regulators. This initially required identification of the pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster in A. niger, which has a different genetic architecture than the cluster identified in P. thymicola (Supplementary Figure S9; Tang et al., 2018). While confirming the involvement of these genes in A. niger, we identified an additional cluster gene, pyrE, that was previously reported to not be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we did not identify any variants within the pyr cluster that could clearly explain the significant increase in pyranonigrin A production in the ISS strain. We therefore extended our study to include genes encoding products known to regulate pyranonigrin A. Thus far, this is limited to the transcription factor Fum21, which is regulated by FlbA, a regulator of G-protein signaling that plays a critical role in sporulation and whose deficiency results in thin cell walls and cell lysis (Krijgsheld et al., 2013; Aerts et al., 2018). It has been reported that Fum21 deficiency leads to downregulation of genes from 4 different SM clusters, accompanied by a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production (Aerts et al., 2018). Although we did not identify any critical mutation within/near fum21, our investigation revealed 3 INDELs that account for the modification of 29 bps within the promoter region of flbA. It is highly probable that these mutations could lead to altered regulation of FlbA, which may help explain the dramatic increase in pyranonigrin A production in the ISS strain. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm this possibility, and to explore the potential impact of the observed promoter-region mutations on other biological processes within A. niger, such as sporulation and cell wall structure, as such studies may provide insight into why these variations may be favorable in ISS conditions. On the other hand, increased pyranonigrin A production levels may also be the result of differences at the epigenetic level, which would be an interesting avenue to explore but was outside the scope of this investigation. Second only to pyranonigrin A, kotanin exhibited a 10-fold increase in production levels in JSC-093350089. Within its biosynthetic gene cluster, mutations were observed within ktnD that could have altered both its regulation and activity, including a 13 bp deletion within the promoter region and 2 missense mutations. It is unclear whether altered regulation of ktnD could explain the increase in kotanin production levels, as the specific role of KtnD, a monooxygenase, in the biosynthesis of kotanin has not been determined, and KtnS was proposed to be the rate-limiting step in the pathway (Gil Girol et al., 2012). Within the pestalamide biosynthetic cluster, several mutations were observed which may explain its twofold increase in production in the ISS strain. Two missense mutations were observed within the gene encoding EpaA, the NR-PKS proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis. Notably, INDELs were observed within the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR of orf1. UTRs often contain regulatory elements that play key roles in appropriate expression of a gene, and therefore the observed variation may be responsible for altered regulatory patterns of orf1, which encodes for an oxidoreductase. The gene product of orf1, also known as AzaJ, is also involved in the biosynthesis of the azanigerones, which are produced by the same cluster as the pestalamides (Zabala et al., 2012). In azanigerone biosynthesis, AzaJ is proposed to catalyze the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, partially facilitating the transformation of azanigerone C to azanigerone A. In pestalamide biosynthesis, AzaJ was proposed to be involved in the generation of the intermediate carbonarone A from the polyketide precursor, which involves oxidation and transamination (Wang et al., 2018). Further studies need to be performed to determine if this step in the pathway is rate-limiting, and if altered expression of azaJ could be responsible for the increase in pestalamide production levels. Another potentially significant mutation that we observed was an insertion in the 3′ UTR of epaB, which encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that may catalyze the formation of 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA, as it plays a similar role in the azanigerone pathway. 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA is then used as a substrate by EpaC followed by cyclization to form pestalamide. Further experiments should be performed to confirm whether the observed 3′ UTR variant alters expression levels of epaB, which then leads to altered pestalamide production levels. Next, we investigated genetic variants associated with genes encoding known regulators of pestalamide, including the pathway-specific transcription factor AzaR and the epigenetic regulator GcnE (Zabala et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018). However, this analysis did not reveal any substantial findings; while both genes possess upstream intergenic variants in JSC-093350089, they were predicted to outside the promoter region. It is reasonable to presume that enhanced production of molecules that confer oxidative stress resistance is a key adaptive characteristic of fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments, as this has been observed among other species (Baqai et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2011). This may explain the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate, and is supported by the UV resistance study, which suggests that pyranonigrin A plays a role in conferring radiation resistance in A. niger. Additionally, we observed a cumulative increase in the production of naphtho-γ-pyrones, which are produced by AlbA, the same PKS responsible for 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) biosynthesis. This stays in agreement with the observed enrichment of AlbA in the proteome of JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Such observations suggest that the ISS isolate produces enhanced levels of DHN-melanin, and is consistent with previous reports that fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments produce enhanced levels of melanin (Singaravelan et al., 2008). In microbial systems, melanin functions as a UV-protectant, an antioxidant, a thermoregulator, and as a toxin-sequestering agent (Cordero and Casadevall, 2017). It is therefore reasonable to presume that increased melanin production may be an adaptive feature that is selected for by spaceflight environments. We were unable to identify any mutations associated with albA that may explain its upregulation and the associated increase in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. Additionally, we could not investigate variants occurring in naphtho-γ-pyrone tailoring enzymes, as those genes are not clustered with albA and have not yet been characterized. Further, as discussed before with regard to the pestalamides, while production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones were reported to increase following deletion of the epigenetic regulator gcnE, we did not identify any mutations associated with gcnE that may explain increased production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones. In summary, this investigation revealed the distinct metabolomic fingerprint of a melanized fungal species capable of withstanding ISS conditions, which featured enhanced production of a molecule with antioxidant and UV-protective properties. Genetic analysis revealed variants that may be responsible for the observed increase in SM production levels. These findings illustrate the therapeutic and economic potential associated with investigating metabolite production in microbes isolated from extreme environments and provide a framework for future efforts to genetically optimize production yields of the bioactive SMs described in this study.Data Availability Statement All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.Author Contributions JR drafted the manuscript, contributed to sample processing, and was responsible for data analysis and interpretation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis.Results Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains.Conclusion Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Enterobacter, International Space Station, Phylogenomic analyses",

    "methods": "Methods Sample collection from ISS environmental surfaces, processing, cultivation of bacteria were already reported [9]. When 105 bacterial strains isolated from various ISS locations were analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations, five isolates were identified as Enterobacter bugandensis. The five Enterobacter isolates characterized during this study were isolated from two different locations of the ISS flight in March 2015. Four isolates were isolated from the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC), and one strain from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) foot platform of ISS. Phenotypic characterization The isolates were biochemically identified using Vitek®2 Compact gram-negative (GN) cards (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) [16] and BioLog (Hayward, CA) carbon substrate utilization profile characterization [17]. Sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS protein analysis was carried out as previously established [18]. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained from an Ultraflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Billerica, MA) operated in linear positive mode under Flex-Control 3.1 software. Mass spectra were processed using Flex Analysis (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik) and BioTyper software (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik). Genome sequence analysis Genomic DNA extraction was performed as described previously [9]. WGS was performed on the Oxford Nanopore MinION (Oxford, United Kingdom) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (San Diego, CA). A hybrid approach was utilized for genome assembly using reads from both platforms. Nanopore reads were processed using Poretools [19] toolkit for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Error corrected Nanopore and MiSeq reads were assembled using SPAdes [20]. Scaffolding of the assembled contigs was done using SSpace [21] and gap filling was executed using GapFiller [22]. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the help of the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [23] and RNAmmer servers [24] for downstream analysis [25, 26] ISS strains assembly characteristics are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. The 16S rRNA, gyrB, and rpoB gene sequences were retrieved from the WGS and analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA7 software package [27]. MLST analysis was carried out as described previously [28]. The MLST scheme employed here uses seven house-keeping genes: dnaA (DNA replication initiator), fusA (codes Elongation factor G), gyrB (DNA replication and repair), leuS (Leucine tRNA ligase), pyrG (CTP synthase), rplB (50S ribosomal protein), and rpoB (β subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase) [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at E. cloacae MLST database [30], concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The genes were analyzed independently, or as a single concatenate using neighbor-joining algorithms. The SNP-based phylogenetic tree was generated using CSIPhylogeny [28] version 1.4. Using genome sequences of multiple isolates CSIPhylogeny calls SNP, filters the SNPs, performs site validation, and infers a phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of high-quality SNPs. The analysis included Enterobacter reference whole genome sequences which were downloaded from the  GenBank database. This genome-wide SNP analysis allows for higher resolution phylogenetic analysis compared to other methods, which is necessary for comparing highly similar genomes. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. A total of 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree. Hybrid-genome-assembly (ONT and Illumina data) of strain IF3SW-P2 was nominated as reference genome of the 5 strains sequenced. The IF3SW-P2 genome was used to realign the Illumina MiSeq reads with reads of other 4 strains using bwa-mem (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). Postprocessing of the BAM files was performed using SAMtools [31] and picard (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard). GATK HaplotypeCaller (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used for SNP and indels identification. Pairwise average nucleotide index (ANI) was calculated using the algorithm from Goris et al. 2007 [32] and GC content was determined using EzTaxon-e [33]. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed using the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator 2.0 (GGDC 2.0) [34]. Briefly, the genome sequences in FASTA format were submitted to GGDC 2.0 along with the sequences in FASTA format for the Enterobacter reference genome that were available: E. aerogenes KCTC 2190, E. asburiae ATCC 35953, E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus ATCC 35316, E. cloacae ATCC 13047, E. hormaechei ATCC 49162, E. kobei DSM 13645, E. lignolyticus SCF1, E. ludwigii EN119, E. massiliensis JC163, E. mori LMG25706, E. muelleri JM-458T, E. xiangfangensis LMG 27195, and E. soli ATCC BAA-2102. The results were obtained by comparing query genomes (ISS isolates) with each of the reference genomes to calculate dDDH and intergenomic distances. Global comparison of ISS isolates with other species was done using local BLAST [35]. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) software [36]. Nucleotide sequence deposition The WGS data submitted to the  () GenBank and NASA GenLab databases were downloaded and characterized during this study. The complete genome sequences of all ISS strains were deposited in  under Bioproject PRJNA319366 as well as at the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-67; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-67/#). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of isolated strains are: IF2SW-B1 (KY218809), IF2SW-B5 (KY218813), IF2SW-P2 T (KY218815), IF2SW-P3 (KY218816), and IF3SW-P2 (KY218819).",
    "results": "Results Phenotypic characteristics The ISS strains showed aerobic, motile, rod shape, Gram stain negative characteristics; colonies were pale yellow in color, formed within 24–36 h at 35 °C on R2A, TSA, and blood agar. Growth was observed at 1–8% NaCl and in pH range 5–7. The Vitek and BioLog systems as well as MALDI-TOF profiles identified the ISS strains as E. ludwigii. The MALDI-TOF profile scores for the tested strains were 2.16 (E. ludwigii) and 2.10 (E. asburiae). In general, no noticeable phenotypic differences were observed among the Enterobacter species tested including E. bugandensis EB-247T, whose genome is closer to ISS strains. As reported earlier, all these five ISS Enterobacter isolates were resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, strains were either resistant or intermediate resistant. For gentamycin and tobramycin some strains were resistant, some intermediate resistant, and some susceptible [9]. Molecular phylogeny The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of all five isolates placed them within the Enterobacter group and showed maximum similarity (99.6%) with E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus LMG 2693, E. ludwigii EN-119, and E. mori R18–2 (99 to 100%). Since 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis is insufficient to differentiate Enterobacter species, polygenic and whole genome-based analyses were further attempted. All ISS strains were phylogenetically characterized by the gyrB locus (~ 1.9 kb) and showed that the ISS isolates form a close group with E. bugandensis EB-247T and 153_ECLO strains (> 99%) while MBRL 1077 isolate was exhibiting 97% similarity with high bootstrap value. MLST analysis The genomic contigs of the ISS isolates were searched for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB. leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use of MLST analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The good congruence between the single-gene reconstructions and the concatenate reinforced the stability of the genealogy were observed. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [37] and the resulting MLST tree (Fig. 1) shows that the ISS isolates are phlylogenetically related to E. bugandensis clinical strains (EB-247, strain 153_ECLO, and isolate MBRL 1077). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Multiple-locus sequence types (MLST) analysis of ISS strains and related species of the Enterobacter. The obtained genomic contigs of the ISS isolates (in bold) were searched for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB, leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use in MLST analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at the Enterobacter MLST database, concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [4], and the bootstrap values were calculated using 1000 replicates. The bar indicates 2% sequence divergence SNP analysis Even though MLST analysis was clearly able to genomically resolve the ISS isolates to species level and distinguish them from other members of the genus Enterobacter, whole genome SNP analysis, SNP tree analysis excluding plasmid sequences, was carried out to validate these results. The snpTree does not ignore any nucleotide positions and is able to consider 100% of the chromosomal genome. All the available WGS of the Enterobacter genus reference genomes from GenBank were used for SNP analysis with snpTree. Of the 22 total nucleotide sequences; 58,121 positions were found in all analyzed genomes and 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree (Fig. 2). The snpTree analyses confirmed and gave a strong validation to the MLST/gyrB data, confirming that all ISS isolates are E. bugandensis but strain MBRL 1077 grouped differently from the members of the E. bugandensis group. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based phylogenetic tree, showing the relationship between the ISS isolates (in bold) and members of the Enterobacter genus. The tree was generated using CSI Phylogeny [28] version 1.4SNP identification within ISS strains was carried out using GATK HaplotypeCaller. Filtered SNP calls and indels (after removal of false positives) are given in the Additional file 1: Table S1. Post-filtration analyses showed that there were 9, 12, 15, 13, and 0 SNPs seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively. Further 6, 0, 4, 6, and 0 indels were seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1). A maximum of 15 SNPs was observed among ISS isolates, probably being clonal in origin, with a very recent common ancestor. However, it should be noted that 4 strains were isolated from location #2 (space toilet) and one strain from the exercise platform (ARED). ANI values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization The ANI values for the ISS strains were maximum against E. bugandensis EB-247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL 1077 strains (> 95%) as were those of MLST analyses, and the ANI values of rest of the Enterobacter genomes tested were < 91% (Table 1). The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) results of the ISS strain showed high similarity with E. bugandensis EB-247 (89.2%), 153_ECLO (89.4%), and MBRL 1077 (64%) strains whereas dDDH value was < 44.6% to all the other available Enterobacter reference genomes (Table 1). Based on various molecular analyses attempted during this study all five ISS Enterobacter strains were phenotypically and genotypically identified as E. bugandensis. Table 1.

A total of 4733 genes were classified as carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes) (Fig. 3). To test antimicrobial resistance at genomic level, the ISS strains were further compared with nosocomial isolates (1291 genomes) having more than 95% ANI identity with the ISS strains, which taxonomically identified them as same species. Genomes of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis 247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL-1077, whose ANI values were > 95%, were used for the genetic comparison to further broaden the picture. Fig. 3.

The predicted arsenic resistance (arsenic resistance protein, ArsH) noticed in E. bugandensis 247 but not in other strains should be phenotypically tested to confirm the resistance properties conferred in strain E. bugandensis 247 and cross checked with the ISS strains for their inability to degrade arsenic. Trace metals detected in ISS potable water samples, but typically below potability requirements, included arsenic, barium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc. No mercury or cadmium was detected and the arsenic levels varied from nondetectable in water samples to a maximum of 3.8 μg/L [38]. Table 2.

was reported to be invaluable [36] in determining the genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes. Visualizing a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Using BRIG, a global visual comparison of ISS isolates with other Enterobacter WGS from the GenBank Microbial Genomes Resource was carried out. The resulting output of the BRIG analysis [36], a visualization image, showed draft genome assembly information, read coverage, assembly breakpoints, and collapsed repeats. The mapping of unassembled sequencing reads of the ISS genomes against fully annotated E. cloacae central reference sequences is depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Global comparison of ISS E. bugandensis with other Enterobacter WGS from  Microbial Genomes Resource was done using BRIG. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BRIG software. The innermost ring indicates the genomic position of the reference genome (E. bugandensis 247T), next ring indicates GC content, and the third ring indicates GC skewness. The remaining 21 rings indicate the presence or absence of BLASTN hits at that position. Each ring represents WGS of single Enterobacter species, each shown in different color.

    "discussion": "Discussion In summary, a comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses of ISS isolates identified as E. bugandensis were carried out. Additional genomic analyses revealed a close genetic relatedness between ISS isolates and nosocomial earth isolates. MLST and whole genome SNP tree placed ISS and nosocomial isolates to a separate clade when phylogenetically aligned with other member of genus Enterobacter. A detailed functional and antimicrobial resistance analysis reveals that the ISS isolates have a 79% probability of being a human pathogen and share similar antimicrobial resistance pattern with E. bugandensis EB-247, MBRL-1077 and 153_ECLO strains, making them relevant for future missions and crew health considerations. A total of 112 identified genes of the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the multidrug resistance tripartite system (also known as 3-protein systems) as shown in a polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 [39], was noticed in the ISS strain. This protein forms the basic structure and plays a crucial role in, the functioning of an efflux pump rendering a microbe drug resistant [40, 41]. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12 [42–44]. Aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, whose role is spectinomycin 9-O-adenylyltransferases, which confers microbial resistance to the aminoglycosides in Salmonella enterica, was also seen in ISS strains [45]. Similarly, resistance to fluoroquinolones due to a mutation in gyrA gene in S. enterica [46], and fosfomycin resistance due to the presence of FosA protein-coding gene, which catalyzes the addition of glutathione to C1 of the oxirane in Serratia marcescens [47], were observed in ISS strains. Multiple copies of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes highly homologous to S. marcescens, a pathogen, were identified in the ISS Enterobacter genomes, which gives an indication that these strains may be a potential human pathogen. When tested with PathogenFinder [48] algorithm, strain IF2SW-P2T had > 77% probability to be a human pathogen. When compared with E. cloacae ATCC 13047, which is a well-described human pathogen [49], all five ISS strains showed a > 79% probability score. Astronauts have been taking beta-lactam based medical drugs for approximately two decades, and ß-lactamase (superfamily I [metal dependent hydrolases] and E.C.3.5.2.6) was present in all strains under study, while penicillin-binding proteins (PPB4B) were only present in MBRL-1077. Fluoroquinolone resistance due to gyrase and topoisomerase mutation was present in all the strains. Metal-dependent hydrolases, cation efflux system protein CusA, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein CzcA, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator, Co/Zn/Cd efflux system membrane fusion protein, zinc transporter ZitB were found in both ISS isolate and nosocomial organism understudy. These genes principally help in detoxification of periplasm by exporting toxic metal cation outside the cell. Determinants of the metal resistance are usually located on the plasmid and readily acquired from the environment and also complement antibiotic resistance [50, 51]. The plasmid encoded putative transcriptional regulators containing the CopG/Arc/MetJ DNA-binding domain and a metal-binding domain were present in the ISS strains (Additional file 2: Table S2). Further studies are required for phenotypic characterization to confirm this trait. Presence of active beta lactamase gene, efflux pump, and RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division protein family) protein family renders broad-spectrum resistance to ISS isolates from drugs and natural inhibitors. We have recently observed that competency of bacteria to acquire foreign genetic material increases in microgravity (in preparation) and similar mechanism for metal resistance of ISS strain was also predicted. Antimicrobial and metal resistance is also conferred by RND genes [52], which were present in all the strains under study. Genomic analysis reveals the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [41]. RND efflux system, inner membrane transporter CmeB, membrane fusion protein CmeA, outer membrane lipoprotein CmeC, outer membrane lipoprotein NodT family were found in all strains. These become important for the future space studies, as MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to the substances like bile, hormone and host defense molecule [53], which can make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to pathogenicity in humans.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion The genomic characterizations showed that the ISS Enterobacter strains might potentially exhibit pathogenicity to human. However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains compared to clinical strains isolated from patients should be explored in vivo experiments before making any assumption about whether these potential AMR gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not. Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms from the ISS may have some small impact on the response or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of opportunistic pathogen bacteria [25, 26]. To avoid this, future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing directly in microgravity as well as additional function and taxonomic classification methods [26, 54], and then leverage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge relevance for crew health and safety.",

Copyright notice ID: 6251167 PMID: 30466389 Abstract Background The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis.Results Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains.Conclusion Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Enterobacter, International Space Station, Phylogenomic analysesBackground Enterobacter species are facultative anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, and saprophytic microorganisms found in soil, sewage, and as a commensal enteric flora of the human gastrointestinal tract [1]. They have been associated with nosocomial infection in humans, causing bacteremia, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue infections, lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections [2, 3]. Some Enterobacter have also been reported plant pathogens [4]. Antibiotic resistance and its clinical implications have been extensively studied in genus Enterobacter, especially Enterobacter cloacae, which is resistant to cephalosporins, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and cefoxitin [5, 6]. In an ongoing effort of the International Space Station (ISS) Microbial Observatory investigation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is cataloging the total and viable microbial communities of crew-associated environments using cultivation and molecular techniques of microbial detection [7, 8]. As a result, five isolates belonging to the Enterobacter bugandensis group of bacteria from two different locations of the ISS were isolated [9]. Since the initial molecular screening identified these strains as Enterobacter but the identification was not able to resolve their taxonomy to species level, detailed genomic characterizations were warranted in addition to the traditional microbiological characterization. Due to its unstable taxonomic structure, methods utilized for the speciation of Enterobacter varied widely. Commercial biochemical typing systems such as API® 20E [10] or Vitek® 2, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) [11] methods have been used, but with limited success. On the basis of 16S rRNA analysis, Enterobacter was structured as a polyphyletic genus and most of the species could not be resolved [1]. Therefore, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was found to be more appropriate for phylogenetic classification of Enterobacter species [12]. To resolve this question further, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and de novo assembly was performed on all five ISS E. bugandensis strains, creating MLST and genome variation profiles of the ISS strains [13]. Furthermore, comparative genome alignment of the ISS strains with all publicly available 1291 Enterobacter genomes revealed that genomes of these five ISS strains were highly similar to only three clinical E. bugandensis with very high genome similarities and formed a unique ecotype. They are (a) EB-247 strain [13], isolated from neonatal blood of a patient from Tanzania, (b) 153_ECLO strain [14], isolated from the urine of a neonatal patient strain admitted to the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA and (c) MBRL 1077 strain, a carbapenemase-producing strain [15] isolated from the wound of a 72-year-old woman with a history of cutaneous scleroderma, medically complicated obesity, and venous insufficiency. In this study, comparative genomic analyses of five ISS strains and three clinical isolates were carried out to elucidate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, MDR gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic potential of the ISS Enterobacter strains.Methods Sample collection from ISS environmental surfaces, processing, cultivation of bacteria were already reported [9]. When 105 bacterial strains isolated from various ISS locations were analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations, five isolates were identified as Enterobacter bugandensis. The five Enterobacter isolates characterized during this study were isolated from two different locations of the ISS flight in March 2015. Four isolates were isolated from the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC), and one strain from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) foot platform of ISS. Phenotypic characterization The isolates were biochemically identified using Vitek®2 Compact gram-negative (GN) cards (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) [16] and BioLog (Hayward, CA) carbon substrate utilization profile characterization [17]. Sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS protein analysis was carried out as previously established [18]. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained from an Ultraflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Billerica, MA) operated in linear positive mode under Flex-Control 3.1 software. Mass spectra were processed using Flex Analysis (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik) and BioTyper software (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik).Genome sequence analysis Genomic DNA extraction was performed as described previously [9]. WGS was performed on the Oxford Nanopore MinION (Oxford, United Kingdom) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (San Diego, CA). A hybrid approach was utilized for genome assembly using reads from both platforms. Nanopore reads were processed using Poretools [19] toolkit for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Error corrected Nanopore and MiSeq reads were assembled using SPAdes [20]. Scaffolding of the assembled contigs was done using SSpace [21] and gap filling was executed using GapFiller [22]. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the help of the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [23] and RNAmmer servers [24] for downstream analysis [25, 26] ISS strains assembly characteristics are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. The 16S rRNA, gyrB, and rpoB gene sequences were retrieved from the WGS and analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA7 software package [27]. MLST analysis was carried out as described previously [28]. The MLST scheme employed here uses seven house-keeping genes: dnaA (DNA replication initiator), fusA (codes Elongation factor G), gyrB (DNA replication and repair), leuS (Leucine tRNA ligase), pyrG (CTP synthase), rplB (50S ribosomal protein), and rpoB (β subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase) [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at E. cloacae MLST database [30], concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The genes were analyzed independently, or as a single concatenate using neighbor-joining algorithms. The SNP-based phylogenetic tree was generated using CSIPhylogeny [28] version 1.4. Using genome sequences of multiple isolates CSIPhylogeny calls SNP, filters the SNPs, performs site validation, and infers a phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of high-quality SNPs. The analysis included Enterobacter reference whole genome sequences which were downloaded from the  GenBank database. This genome-wide SNP analysis allows for higher resolution phylogenetic analysis compared to other methods, which is necessary for comparing highly similar genomes. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. A total of 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree. Hybrid-genome-assembly (ONT and Illumina data) of strain IF3SW-P2 was nominated as reference genome of the 5 strains sequenced. The IF3SW-P2 genome was used to realign the Illumina MiSeq reads with reads of other 4 strains using bwa-mem (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). Postprocessing of the BAM files was performed using SAMtools [31] and picard (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard). GATK HaplotypeCaller (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used for SNP and indels identification. Pairwise average nucleotide index (ANI) was calculated using the algorithm from Goris et al. 2007 [32] and GC content was determined using EzTaxon-e [33]. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed using the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator 2.0 (GGDC 2.0) [34]. Briefly, the genome sequences in FASTA format were submitted to GGDC 2.0 along with the sequences in FASTA format for the Enterobacter reference genome that were available: E. aerogenes KCTC 2190, E. asburiae ATCC 35953, E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus ATCC 35316, E. cloacae ATCC 13047, E. hormaechei ATCC 49162, E. kobei DSM 13645, E. lignolyticus SCF1, E. ludwigii EN119, E. massiliensis JC163, E. mori LMG25706, E. muelleri JM-458T, E. xiangfangensis LMG 27195, and E. soli ATCC BAA-2102. The results were obtained by comparing query genomes (ISS isolates) with each of the reference genomes to calculate dDDH and intergenomic distances. Global comparison of ISS isolates with other species was done using local BLAST [35]. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) software [36].Nucleotide sequence deposition The WGS data submitted to the  () GenBank and NASA GenLab databases were downloaded and characterized during this study. The complete genome sequences of all ISS strains were deposited in  under Bioproject PRJNA319366 as well as at the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-67; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-67/#). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of isolated strains are: IF2SW-B1 (KY218809), IF2SW-B5 (KY218813), IF2SW-P2 T (KY218815), IF2SW-P3 (KY218816), and IF3SW-P2 (KY218819).Results Phenotypic characteristics The ISS strains showed aerobic, motile, rod shape, Gram stain negative characteristics; colonies were pale yellow in color, formed within 24–36 h at 35 °C on R2A, TSA, and blood agar. Growth was observed at 1–8% NaCl and in pH range 5–7. The Vitek and BioLog systems as well as MALDI-TOF profiles identified the ISS strains as E. ludwigii. The MALDI-TOF profile scores for the tested strains were 2.16 (E. ludwigii) and 2.10 (E. asburiae). In general, no noticeable phenotypic differences were observed among the Enterobacter species tested including E. bugandensis EB-247T, whose genome is closer to ISS strains. As reported earlier, all these five ISS Enterobacter isolates were resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, strains were either resistant or intermediate resistant. For gentamycin and tobramycin some strains were resistant, some intermediate resistant, and some susceptible [9].Molecular phylogeny The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of all five isolates placed them within the Enterobacter group and showed maximum similarity (99.6%) with E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus LMG 2693, E. ludwigii EN-119, and E. mori R18–2 (99 to 100%). Since 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis is insufficient to differentiate Enterobacter species, polygenic and whole genome-based analyses were further attempted. All ISS strains were phylogenetically characterized by the gyrB locus (~ 1.9 kb) and showed that the ISS isolates form a close group with E. bugandensis EB-247T and 153_ECLO strains (> 99%) while MBRL 1077 isolate was exhibiting 97% similarity with high bootstrap value.MLST analysis The genomic contigs of the ISS isolates were searched for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB. leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use of MLST analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The good congruence between the single-gene reconstructions and the concatenate reinforced the stability of the genealogy were observed. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [37] and the resulting MLST tree (Fig. 1) shows that the ISS isolates are phlylogenetically related to E. bugandensis clinical strains (EB-247, strain 153_ECLO, and isolate MBRL 1077). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Multiple-locus sequence types (MLST) analysis of ISS strains and related species of the Enterobacter. The obtained genomic contigs of the ISS isolates (in bold) were searched for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB, leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use in MLST analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at the Enterobacter MLST database, concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [4], and the bootstrap values were calculated using 1000 replicates. The bar indicates 2% sequence divergenceSNP analysis Even though MLST analysis was clearly able to genomically resolve the ISS isolates to species level and distinguish them from other members of the genus Enterobacter, whole genome SNP analysis, SNP tree analysis excluding plasmid sequences, was carried out to validate these results. The snpTree does not ignore any nucleotide positions and is able to consider 100% of the chromosomal genome. All the available WGS of the Enterobacter genus reference genomes from GenBank were used for SNP analysis with snpTree. Of the 22 total nucleotide sequences; 58,121 positions were found in all analyzed genomes and 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree (Fig. 2). The snpTree analyses confirmed and gave a strong validation to the MLST/gyrB data, confirming that all ISS isolates are E. bugandensis but strain MBRL 1077 grouped differently from the members of the E. bugandensis group. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based phylogenetic tree, showing the relationship between the ISS isolates (in bold) and members of the Enterobacter genus. The tree was generated using CSI Phylogeny [28] version 1.4SNP identification within ISS strains was carried out using GATK HaplotypeCaller. Filtered SNP calls and indels (after removal of false positives) are given in the Additional file 1: Table S1. Post-filtration analyses showed that there were 9, 12, 15, 13, and 0 SNPs seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively. Further 6, 0, 4, 6, and 0 indels were seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1). A maximum of 15 SNPs was observed among ISS isolates, probably being clonal in origin, with a very recent common ancestor. However, it should be noted that 4 strains were isolated from location #2 (space toilet) and one strain from the exercise platform (ARED).ANI values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization The ANI values for the ISS strains were maximum against E. bugandensis EB-247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL 1077 strains (> 95%) as were those of MLST analyses, and the ANI values of rest of the Enterobacter genomes tested were < 91% (Table 1). The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) results of the ISS strain showed high similarity with E. bugandensis EB-247 (89.2%), 153_ECLO (89.4%), and MBRL 1077 (64%) strains whereas dDDH value was < 44.6% to all the other available Enterobacter reference genomes (Table 1). Based on various molecular analyses attempted during this study all five ISS Enterobacter strains were phenotypically and genotypically identified as E. bugandensis. Table 1.

A total of 4733 genes were classified as carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes) (Fig. 3). To test antimicrobial resistance at genomic level, the ISS strains were further compared with nosocomial isolates (1291 genomes) having more than 95% ANI identity with the ISS strains, which taxonomically identified them as same species. Genomes of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis 247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL-1077, whose ANI values were > 95%, were used for the genetic comparison to further broaden the picture. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Metabolic functional profiles and subsystem categories distribution of strain IF3SW-P2. 4733 genes were identified that dominated by carbohydrate metabolism followed by amino acid and derivativesFeatures playing a broad role and implemented by the same domain such as Spectinomycin 9-O-adenylyltransferase and Streptomycin 3-O-adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.47) were only present in E. bugandensis 247 due to the probable lack of selective pressure that might have been encountered by the ISS isolates (Table 2). The predicted arsenic resistance (arsenic resistance protein, ArsH) noticed in E. bugandensis 247 but not in other strains should be phenotypically tested to confirm the resistance properties conferred in strain E. bugandensis 247 and cross checked with the ISS strains for their inability to degrade arsenic. Trace metals detected in ISS potable water samples, but typically below potability requirements, included arsenic, barium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc. No mercury or cadmium was detected and the arsenic levels varied from nondetectable in water samples to a maximum of 3.8 μg/L [38]. Table 2.

was reported to be invaluable [36] in determining the genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes. Visualizing a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Using BRIG, a global visual comparison of ISS isolates with other Enterobacter WGS from the GenBank Microbial Genomes Resource was carried out. The resulting output of the BRIG analysis [36], a visualization image, showed draft genome assembly information, read coverage, assembly breakpoints, and collapsed repeats. The mapping of unassembled sequencing reads of the ISS genomes against fully annotated E. cloacae central reference sequences is depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Global comparison of ISS E. bugandensis with other Enterobacter WGS from  Microbial Genomes Resource was done using BRIG. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BRIG software. The innermost ring indicates the genomic position of the reference genome (E. bugandensis 247T), next ring indicates GC content, and the third ring indicates GC skewness. The remaining 21 rings indicate the presence or absence of BLASTN hits at that position. Each ring represents WGS of single Enterobacter species, each shown in different color. Positions covered by BLASTN alignments are indicated in solid colors and gaps (white spaces) represent genomic regions not covered by BLASTN alignments. Order of genome from inner ring to outer is as follow: E. aerogenes KCTC 2190, E. asburiae ATCC 35953 T, E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus ATCC 35316, E. bugandensis 153_ECLO, E. cloacae ATCC 13047T, E. bugandensis MBRL1077, E. hormaechei ATCC 49162T, E. kobei DSM 13645T, E. lignolyticus SCF1, E. ludwigii EN-119T, E. massiliensis JC163T, E. mori LMG 25706T, E. muelleri JM-458T, Enterobacter soli ATCC BAA-2102T, Enterobacter xiangfangensis LMG 27195T, E. bugandensis IF2SW-B1, E. bugandensis IF2SW-B5, E. bugandensis IF2SW-P2, E. bugandensis IF2SW-P3, E. bugandensis IF3SW-P2, Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC 19061TDiscussion In summary, a comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses of ISS isolates identified as E. bugandensis were carried out. Additional genomic analyses revealed a close genetic relatedness between ISS isolates and nosocomial earth isolates. MLST and whole genome SNP tree placed ISS and nosocomial isolates to a separate clade when phylogenetically aligned with other member of genus Enterobacter. A detailed functional and antimicrobial resistance analysis reveals that the ISS isolates have a 79% probability of being a human pathogen and share similar antimicrobial resistance pattern with E. bugandensis EB-247, MBRL-1077 and 153_ECLO strains, making them relevant for future missions and crew health considerations. A total of 112 identified genes of the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the multidrug resistance tripartite system (also known as 3-protein systems) as shown in a polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 [39], was noticed in the ISS strain. This protein forms the basic structure and plays a crucial role in, the functioning of an efflux pump rendering a microbe drug resistant [40, 41]. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12 [42–44]. Aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, whose role is spectinomycin 9-O-adenylyltransferases, which confers microbial resistance to the aminoglycosides in Salmonella enterica, was also seen in ISS strains [45]. Similarly, resistance to fluoroquinolones due to a mutation in gyrA gene in S. enterica [46], and fosfomycin resistance due to the presence of FosA protein-coding gene, which catalyzes the addition of glutathione to C1 of the oxirane in Serratia marcescens [47], were observed in ISS strains. Multiple copies of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes highly homologous to S. marcescens, a pathogen, were identified in the ISS Enterobacter genomes, which gives an indication that these strains may be a potential human pathogen. When tested with PathogenFinder [48] algorithm, strain IF2SW-P2T had > 77% probability to be a human pathogen. When compared with E. cloacae ATCC 13047, which is a well-described human pathogen [49], all five ISS strains showed a > 79% probability score. Astronauts have been taking beta-lactam based medical drugs for approximately two decades, and ß-lactamase (superfamily I [metal dependent hydrolases] and E.C.3.5.2.6) was present in all strains under study, while penicillin-binding proteins (PPB4B) were only present in MBRL-1077. Fluoroquinolone resistance due to gyrase and topoisomerase mutation was present in all the strains. Metal-dependent hydrolases, cation efflux system protein CusA, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein CzcA, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator, Co/Zn/Cd efflux system membrane fusion protein, zinc transporter ZitB were found in both ISS isolate and nosocomial organism understudy. These genes principally help in detoxification of periplasm by exporting toxic metal cation outside the cell. Determinants of the metal resistance are usually located on the plasmid and readily acquired from the environment and also complement antibiotic resistance [50, 51]. The plasmid encoded putative transcriptional regulators containing the CopG/Arc/MetJ DNA-binding domain and a metal-binding domain were present in the ISS strains (Additional file 2: Table S2). Further studies are required for phenotypic characterization to confirm this trait. Presence of active beta lactamase gene, efflux pump, and RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division protein family) protein family renders broad-spectrum resistance to ISS isolates from drugs and natural inhibitors. We have recently observed that competency of bacteria to acquire foreign genetic material increases in microgravity (in preparation) and similar mechanism for metal resistance of ISS strain was also predicted. Antimicrobial and metal resistance is also conferred by RND genes [52], which were present in all the strains under study. Genomic analysis reveals the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [41]. RND efflux system, inner membrane transporter CmeB, membrane fusion protein CmeA, outer membrane lipoprotein CmeC, outer membrane lipoprotein NodT family were found in all strains. These become important for the future space studies, as MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to the substances like bile, hormone and host defense molecule [53], which can make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to pathogenicity in humans.Conclusion The genomic characterizations showed that the ISS Enterobacter strains might potentially exhibit pathogenicity to human. However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains compared to clinical strains isolated from patients should be explored in vivo experiments before making any assumption about whether these potential AMR gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not. Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms from the ISS may have some small impact on the response or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of opportunistic pathogen bacteria [25, 26]. To avoid this, future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing directly in microgravity as well as additional function and taxonomic classification methods [26, 54], and then leverage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge relevance for crew health and safety.Additional files Additional file 1: (11.8KB, xlsx) Table S1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.

Copyright notice ID: 9098231 MSID: MS1065202 PMID: 30539259 The publisher's version of this article is available at Appl Microbiol Biotechnol Abstract The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments. Keywords: Aspergillus nidulans, International Space Station, genomics, proteomics, metabolomicsINTRODUCTION It has been well documented that fungal populations persist in extreme conditions, such as various temperatures and pH (López-Archilla et al. 2001; Amaral Zettler et al. 2002; Onofri et al. 2007; de Crecy et al. 2009; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2009), desiccation (Barnard et al. 2013), ionizing radiation (Dadachova and Casadevall 2008; Tkavc et al. 2018), Mars-like conditions (de la Torre Noetzel et al. 2018; Onofri et al. 2018a; Onofri et al. 2018b), and the spacecraft environment (Onofri et al. 2008; Checinska et al. 2015). Through adaptation, fungi have developed the capacity to sense and respond to external stimuli, enabling their survival in a wide variety of ecological niches (Onofri et al. 2007; Onofri et al. 2008; Dadachova and Casadevall 2008; de Crecy et al. 2009; Checinska et al. 2015). These omnipresent microorganisms can be both beneficial and detrimental to human health, as fungi produce a myriad of secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to environmental stressors with activities ranging from therapeutic to toxic (Segal 2009; Newman and Cragg 2012; Sharpe et al. 2015). SMs have had a tremendous impact on human health, as the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore. In fact, approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs (Newman and Cragg 2012). Fungi are also potent producers of enzymes, and therefore have various industrial applications (Vries and Visser 2001; MacCabe et al. 2002). We are on the cusp of significant advances in human interplanetary space exploration, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aims to send humans back to the Moon and subsequently to Mars in the 2030s. In entering this new era of human spaceflight, a thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered while in space will play an important role in ensuring a health living environment for crew-members. Further, such studies enable the evaluation of fungi as drug production hosts during these exploration class missions, as fungi currently play an indispensable role in pharmaceutical biotechnology on Earth. Fungi residing onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to microgravity and increased levels of radiation due to being outside of Earth’s protective atmosphere (Horneck et al. 2010). Microgravity is thought to decrease the transfer of extracellular nutrients and metabolic by-products, which may alter the chemical environment that the cell is exposed to (Horneck et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2018). Radiation alters biological processes by acting as a promoter of mutagenesis, which may result in an increased rate of biological evolution leading to the development of adaptive responses (Horneck et al. 2006). Although it has been established that fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments (Pierson 2001; Novikova et al. 2006; Van Houdt et al. 2012; Venkateswaran et al. 2014; Checinska et al. 2015), our understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various conditions encountered during spaceflight remains in its infancy (Council 2011). The objective of this study was to investigate the changes encountered in various aspects of fungal “omics” under ISS conditions using the well-characterized organism Aspergillus nidulans. Of 30 distinct fungal species retrieved from ISS habitat surfaces during one microbial monitoring study, Aspergillus was the dominant genus, featuring a diverse population of 13 species, with A. nidulans being one of four fungal species isolated from both surfaces and air onboard the ISS (Novikova et al. 2006). Of particular interest is how the space environment alters secondary metabolism, as fungal SM production is highly variable and dependent on external stimuli (Haas 2015). A. nidulans is an extensively studied model organism and in the last decade many of the genes and regulatory networks involved in SM formation have been characterized (Yaegashi et al. 2014). This new information enabled a comprehensive investigation into genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations in response to the space environment. Herein, we report the multi-omic characterization of wild-type (WT) A. nidulans FGSC A4 and three mutant strains, displayed in Supplemental Table S1, following 4 and 7 days of growth onboard the ISS and compared to ground counterparts (Fig. 1). The first mutant strain, LO1362, is the A. nidulans nkuA deletion strain, which is a homolog of the human KU70 gene. These genes are crucial for non-homologous end joining of DNA double strand break repair, and therefore deletion of nkuA disrupts a major DNA repair mechanism in A. nidulans (Krappmann 2007). The second mutant strain, LO8158, is deficient in mcrA, which is a negative regulator of at least 10 SM gene clusters (Oakley et al. 2017). Deletion of this gene stimulates SM production while impairing fungal growth. The final mutant strain used in this study was an A. nidulans laeA overexpression mutant, CW12001. LaeA is a global positive regulator of secondary metabolism, and therefore overexpression of laeA increases the production levels of a number of SMs (Bok and Keller 2004). ISS- and Earth-grown strains were subjected to genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses with the aim to identify genetic and molecular alterations that occur in fungi in response to exposure to the space environment that could pave the way to new discoveries that could benefit human spaceflight and people on Earth. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Schematic overview of the A. nidulans ISS experiment. The A. nidulans wild-type (FGSC A4) and three mutant strains (LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001) were seeded onto GMM agar Omnitray plates and integrated into PHAB systems. Samples were transported to the ISS at 4°C, where they remained for approximately 26 or 23 days until being subjected to growth in SABL systems at 37°C for either 4 or 7 days, respectively. Earth-grown PHABs were simultaneously transferred to on-ground containers mimicking ISS SABL systems. Following growth, all samples were subjected to 4°C and ISS-grown samples were transported to Earth. All samples were subjected to genomic, proteomic, and metabolomics analyses.MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, media, and growth conditions The WT A. nidulans FGSC A4 strain was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (McCluskey et al. 2010). LO1362 and LO8158 were obtained from previous studies (Oakley et al. 2017). The laeA overexpression strain (CW12001) was generated using the constitutive gpdA promoter according to standard protocol (Hunter et al. 1992). Protoplast production, construction of fusion PCR products, and transformation were carried out as described previously (Szewczyk et al. 2006; Nayak et al. 2006). Primers used are listed in Table S2 and correct transformants were verified using diagnostic PCR. All strains were seeded onto Nunc OmniTray plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) (Supplementary Fig. S1a) containing 46 ml of solid GMM media (6g/L NaNO3, 0.52 g/L KCl, 0.52 g/L MgSO4*7H2O, 1.52 g/L KH2PO4, 10g/L D-glucose, 15 g/L agar supplemented with 1ml/L of Hutner’s trace elements). Seeded Nunc OmniTrays were loaded into Plate Habitat (PHAB) systems (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, Colorado, USA) (Supplementary Fig. S1b), with 6 Omnitray plates in each PHAB, and immediately transferred to 4°C. The PHAB system is a growth platform for biological materials that allows for gas exchange. Each PHAB was equipped with a temperature logger (HOBO) (Supplementary Fig. S1c) that accurately measured the temperature throughout the duration of the experiment. PHABs containing cultures bound for the ISS were transferred to 4°C cold bags approximately 28 hours prior to launch, and transported to the ISS on the SpaceX CRS-8 (Space Exploration Technologies) mission that launched on April 8, 2016. On the ISS, PHABs were loaded into Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) systems (Supplementary Fig. S1d), where the 7- and 4-day samples remained at 4°C for approximately 23 and 26 days, respectively. Ground culture PHABs were near-synchronously transferred to on-ground containers mimicking ISS SABL systems. To initiate growth, ISS and ground cultures were subjected to 37°C, where they remained for either 4 or 7 days, which are optimal growth conditions for SM production in A. nidulans. Following growth, all samples were subjected to 4°C, where they remained until ISS-grown agar plates were transported back to Earth on May 11, 2016. A more detailed explanation of space flight hardware, science preparation and loading, the flight operation timeline, and ISS environmental parameters can be found in the Supplemental Methods. All subsequent analyses of ISS- and ground-grown fungal samples, including genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic characterization, were conducted on Earth.Genomic DNA extraction, library preparation, and genome sequencing Mycelia was collected from Earth-grown (7-day) and space-grown (4- and 7-day) GMM agar Omnitrays for all strains (FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001), frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground using a mortar and pestle. DNA was extracted using the Mo Bio PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Library preparation and whole genome sequencing were performed at the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA). DNA quality and quantity were checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The library was prepared for paired-end sequencing using the TruSeq Nano DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Samples were sequenced using a HiSeq 4000 Illumina Sequencer and 101 base read lengths were generated.Genetic mutation identification Illumina sequence reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 (Bolger et al. 2014) and quality was checked using FastQC v 0.11.7 (Andrews 2010). The genome and annotation files for A. nidulans FGSC A4 (Galagan et al. 2005) were downloaded from the FungiDB web portal (Stajich et al. 2012). Reads were mapped to the FGSC A4 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package v 0.7.12 (Li and Durbin 2009), and further processed with SAMtools v 1.6 to generate sorted BAM files (Li et al. 2009). SNPs and indels were identified using GATK v 3.7 (DePristo et al. 2011). Duplicates were marked using Picard-tools MarkDuplicates (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to remove PCR artifacts. Sequence reads containing putative indels were realigned using GATK’s IndelRealigner to generate an updated BAM file. Variants within each sample were called using GATK’s Haplotype Caller, and the resulting Variant Call Format (VCF) files were combined using GATK’s Genotype GVCFs so that there was one VCF file for each strain (4 in total). GATK’s VariantFiltration was used to filter each VCF file based on stringent cutoffs for quality and coverage {SNPs: QD <2.0, MQ <40.0, QUAL <100, FS >60.0, MQRankSum <−12.5, SOR >4.0, ReadPosRankSum <−8.0; Indels: QD <2.0, FS >200.0, MQRankSum <−12.5, SOR >4, InbreedingCoeff <−0.8, ReadPosRankSum <−20.0}, so that only high-quality variants remained.Protein extraction Mycelia was collected from Earth-grown (7-day) and space-grown (4- and 7-day) GMM agar Omnitrays for all strains (FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001), frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground using a mortar and pestle. For protein extraction, the lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (100X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The frozen ground mycelia were transferred and subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Rockville, Maryland, USA) in which each sample was processed inside a 2-mL cryotube with 1.0 mm glass beads for three times (at 4°C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 s pauses in between). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, California, USA).Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling About 200 μg proteins from each sample were precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4°C. Protein pellets were obtained by centrifugation (17,000 g), washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 25μL TEAB (100 mM) and 25μL 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Proteins were reduced by adding 1μL of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C (10 mM final TCEP concentration). Proteins were alkylated in presence of iodoacetamide (IAA, 30 mM) in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature. 2.5 μg per sample of mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used to digest the peptides overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). 40 μg of peptides from each sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMT 6-plex (TMT6) Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-130 label was used as either 4 day or 7 day strains’ reference that contained 5 μg of peptides from each of the 8 strain. The TMT6-131 label was used as a total mixture reference that contained 2.5 μg of peptides from each of the 16 strains. All six labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). While this kit usually uses only eight fractions with step elution of up to 50% acetonitrile, we added a ninths fraction eluting at 100% acetonitrile. Nine fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.LC-MS/MS analysis The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASYnLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph, a 75 μm x 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, a 75 μm x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The column temperature was maintained at 45 °C and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3–30% solvent B (100 min), 30–50% solvent B (3 min), 50–90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1 % formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400–1500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2×105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2–7 with a ±10 ppm mass window using a 70 s dynamic exclusion. The MS2 scan (m/z 400–2000) was performed using the linear ion trap with the CID collision energy set to 35 %. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid”, with an AGC target of 4×103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subsequently simultaneously selected for an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (m/z 100–500) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a collision energy setting of 55 %, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5×103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.Quantitative proteomics analysis All MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer v 2.2.0.388 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against an Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4 database containing 10,525 protein group sequences based on the annotated genome (, BioProject PRJEA40559, Assembly GCA_000011425.1, Release date 2009/09/24). The search was performed with the following parameters: 2 maximum missed cleavage sites, 6 minimum peptide length, 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses, and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of protein N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the coisolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reported peaks was greater than 10. The quantitative abundance of each protein is determined from the total intensity of the detected reporter ions. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ion (TMT6- 131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For the statistical analysis, technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only proteins that were identified and quantified with at least one peptide detected in all three technical replicates were considered for the analysis. The normalization across two biological sample sets in eight TMT experiments was carried out according to Plubell, D.L. et al. with modifications (Plubell et al. 2017). Briefly, the data from the eight TMT experiments were first corrected for small systematic differences resulting from sample loading variations and labeling efficiency, by normalizing the reporter ion totals for each channel. The trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization corrected the compositional bias by aligning the median of the distribution of abundance intensities between samples (Robinson and Oshlack 2010). Internal reference scaling was used to adjust eight TMT data sets onto the same intensity scale. The normalized data was then averaged and log2 transformed. One-way ANOVA was preformed to identify proteins that were differentially expressed among strains in either 4 days or 7 days, respectively (p-value ≤ 0.05). The identified proteins were also evaluated for up- and downregulation by setting a ±2-fold change cut-off.Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis Organic compounds were extracted by taking 3 plugs of fungal-grown agar and extracting with 3 ml methanol (MeOH), followed by 3 ml 1:1 MeOH-dichloromethane, each with 1 hour of sonication and filtration. The extract was evaporated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator, re-dissolved in 250 μl of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in MeOH, and a portion (10 μl) was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPLCDAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 μm; 2.1 by 100 μm; Alltech Prevail) at a flow rate of 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for HPLC-DAD-MS was 95% MeCN/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with 0% solve B from 45 to 50 min. For quantification, positive-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) was used for the detection of austinol, dehydroaustinol, sterigmatocystin, nidulanin A and analogues, emericellamides A and C-F, emericellin, shamixanthone, and epishamixanthone. Negative-ion ESI was used for the detection of asperthecin, terrequinone, and sterigmatocystin intermediate. Relative production levels were quantified by integrating the area under each SM’s ESI trace.Data availability Raw WGS data for ISS-grown A. nidulans strains and ground-grown counterparts are available in the  SRA under accession numbers SRR7724113- SRR7724124 and BioProject accession number PRJNA486827. Proteomics data is accessible through the ProteomeXchange Consortium via PRIDE with the dataset identifier PXD010778.RESULTS Genome variation among ISS-grown samples To identify genomic alterations occurring in A. nidulans strains in response to ISS conditions, whole genome paired-end sequencing (WGS) was performed on ISS-grown samples and ground-grown control strains, which were subjected to growth for 7 days. Reads were aligned to the FGSC A4 reference genome and any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in ground controls were removed from each strain’s sample set, which resulted in the removal of 208, 194, 231, and 224 SNPs from the FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively. This revealed 129, 136, 108, and 106 SNPs, and 36, 39, 41, and 31 INDELs in ISS-grown FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively, that occurred in ISS-grown samples when compared to ground controls, the features of which are displayed in Table 1. All identified SNPs and INDELs are summarized in Supplementary Tables S3–6, presenting FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively. The total number of missense mutations observed in ISS-grown strains ranged from 9 to 15 for each strain’s sample set. These mutations were observed within only 5 protein-coding genes, with the same mutation often present in multiple samples (Table 2). A total of 13 unique missense base mutations were observed within AN5254, which encodes a protein containing domains predicted to be involved in RNA binding and RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity. Two unique mutations that resulted in premature stop codon were also observed within AN5254, one of which occurred in both the 4- and 7-day LO8158 and CW12001 ISS-grown samples. The remaining missense mutations occurred within AN0532, AN0535, AN0537, and AN0538, which are within a few genes away from one another in the genome. AN0532 encodes a predicted DDE1 transposable element gene, while the products of AN05235, AN0537, and AN0538 are uncharacterized. In both CW12001 ISS-grown samples, identical mutations that resulted in the loss of the original stop codon were observed within the laeA (AN0807) gene. The same frameshift stop-gain mutation independently occurred in all space-grown LO1362 and LO8158 samples within the mnpA gene (AN10311) (Supplementary Tables S4–5), which encodes a hyphal cell wall mannoprotein that may influence the surface structure (Jeong et al. 2004).

Most intergenic SNPs were clustered nearby several specific genes and did not appear to be strain specific (Supplementary Tables S3–6). Among all strains, many intergenic SNPs occurred near genes involved in transcription and translation, including the putative C6 transcription factor AN4972, the transcription elongation factor AN11131, the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein AN4298, the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase AN10829 with a predicted role in translational read-through, and AN6968 which is predicted to have RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity. Intergenic SNPs were also clustered nearby the putative alanine-tRNA ligase AN9419, the putative C4 sterol methyl oxidase AN6973 which has a predicted role in sterol metabolism, and AN9410 which has a predicted role in lipid metabolic processes. Intergenic SNPs were also observed near AN0538 and AN0539, which are within the uncharacterized cluster of genes that were reported above to possess high numbers of missense mutations. Most of the remaining intergenic SNPs occurred near AN6972, AN7848, AN10328, and AN11577, the products of which remain uncharacterized.Proteomic profiling of ISS-grown A. nidulans To investigate alterations in the proteome of A. nidulans strains following growth on the ISS, total protein was extracted from two biological replicates of each ISS-grown sample and Earth-grown counterpart. All samples were subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and LC-MS analysis. The resulting MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer with the Sequest-HT search engine against the A. nidulans FGSC A4 protein database (). The abundance ratios for all ISS-grown samples were normalized to their Earth-grown counterparts (Supplementary Table S7, 4-day samples; Supplemental Table S8, 7-day samples), which led to the identification of up- and down-regulated proteins (fold-change (FC) >∣2∣, P < 0.05) in response to the ISS environment (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, only two proteins, QutC (AN1140), which is involved in quinic acid utilization, and AN2704, a putative aryl-alcohol oxidase-related protein, were up-regulated in A. nidulans WT strain. The number of proteins up-regulated and down-regulated in the three ISS-grown mutant strains ranged from 4 to 28, and 2 to 77, respectively, of 10,525 predicted proteins in A. nidulans FGSC A4 in total. Distribution of AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim terms (Arnaud et al. 2010) among the differentially expressed proteins for ISS-grown mutant strains is displayed in Fig. 2b–d. The GO Slim categories that possessed the highest number of differentially expressed proteins in LO1362 were stress response and carbohydrate metabolic processes. Similarly, in both LO8158 and CW12001, most differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Fig. 2.

The heat shock protein Hsp20 (AN10507) was highly affected by ISS conditions, displaying a twofold and fourfold increase in protein abundance in LO1362 and CW12001, respectively, and a twofold decrease in protein abundance in LO8158. Induction of Hsp20 has been reported following exposure to osmotic stress in A. nidulans (Wu et al. 2016). Conversely, the osmotic stress response protein CipB (AN7895) was down-regulated in LO1362 and the chaperone/heat shock protein Awh11 (AN3725) was down-regulated in LO1362 and LO8158. Differential abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was observed among all ISS-grown strains relative to Earth-grown counterparts. The glutathione S-transferase GstB (AN6024), which has been reported to be significantly induced in response to menadione-induced oxidative stress (Pusztahelyi et al. 2011), was up-regulated over twofold in LO8158, but down-regulated 1.7-fold and 1.8-fold in LO1362 and CW12001, respectively, after 7 days of growth on the ISS. Two catalase, CatA (AN8637) and AN8553, exhibited decreased protein abundance in LO8158 and increased protein abundance in CW12001. Similarly, both the nitrosative stress response protein AN2470 and the menadione stress-induced protein AN5564 were down-regulated approximately threefold in LO8158 and upregulated approximately 1.7-fold in CW12001. Up-regulation was observed for phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C AN3636 whose ortholog plays a major role in responding to nutrient deprivation in Candida albicans (Uhl et al. 2003). Additionally, the GPI-anchored protein EcmA (AN4390) whose ortholog plays a major role in cell wall integrity, morphogenesis, and virulence, was up-regulated twofold in LO8158 after 7 days of growth on the ISS (Martinez-Lopez et al. 2004).

The polyketide synthase AptA (AN6000), which is required for biosynthesis of the spore pigment asperthecin (Szewczyk et al. 2008), was up-reguated over twofold in CW12001 and nearly twofold in FGSC A4 strain after 7 days of growth on the ISS. LO1362 also exhibited up-regulation of the monooxygenase MdpD (AN0147) after 7 days of growth. The MdpD protein is the product of a gene in the prenyl xanthone gene cluster, which is responsible for the production of monodictyphenone, emericellin, shamixanthone, and epishamixanthone (Chiang et al. 2010; Sanchez et al. 2011). Interestingly, the opposite was observed in CW12001, as MdpJ (AN10038), which is the product of another gene in the prenyl xanthone gene cluster, exhibited decreased protein abundance in ISS-grown samples after 4 days. A similar trend was observed for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the potent carcinogenic mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST) (Fujii et al. 1976; Brown et al. 1996b). ST gene cluster products AN7817 and StcN (AN7812) exhibited increased protein abundance in LO8158, while StcN was down-regulated in CW12001, following growth in ISS conditions. The proteome of ISS-grown A. nidulans samples also revealed differential levels of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism when compared to Earth-grown controls (Table 3). Many glycoside hydrolases involved in carbohydrate degradation processes were up-regulated more than twofold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples, including beta-1,4-endoglucanase AN8068 and beta-glucosidase BglM (AN7396), both of which are involved in cellulose degradation, alpha-arabinofuranosidase AbfC (AN1277), involved in pectin degradation, endo-1,4-beta-xylanase XlnC (AN1818), involved in xylan degradation, and beta-galactosidase LacA (AN0756), involved in xyloglucan, xylan, pectin, and galactomannan degradation. These glycoside hydrolases also exhibited decreased protein abundance in CW12001 when compared to ground counterparts. A similar trend was observed with alcohol oxidase AN0567, beta-glycosidase AN10124, ketose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase AN2334, dehydratase AN6035, and rhamnogalacturonan lyase RglA (AN7135), which were up-regulated at least twofold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples and down-regulated at least 1.5-fold in CW12001. Conversely, mannose-6-phosphate isomerase AN1715, isocitrate lyase AcuD (AN5634), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase AcuF (AN1918), and NAD+ dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase GfdB (AN6792) were down-regulated at least 2.5-fold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples and up-regulated at least 1.8-fold in CW12001 samples.Secondary metabolome alterations in ISS-grown A. nidulans Alterations in SM production of A. nidulans in response to ISS conditions were assessed by extracting SMs from three biological replicates of each ISS- and Earth-grown counterpart, and were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). All SMs were identified based on mass, UV absorption, and retention time, which led to the identification of austinol and dehydroaustinol (Lo et al. 2012), terrequinone (Bok et al. 2006), sterigmatocystin and its intermediate (Brown et al. 1996a), nidulanin A and its analogues (Andersen et al. 2013), the emericellamides (Chiang et al. 2008), the prenyl xanthones (Sanchez et al. 2011), and asperthecin (Sanchez et al. 2012) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Relative differences in SM production levels of ISS-grown samples and Earth-grown counterparts were quantified by integrating the area under each SM’s EIC trace (Supplementary Fig. S3). ISS conditions induced asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001 after 7 days of growth, with production levels increased by over 300% and 150%, respectively (Fig. 3). Production levels of prenyl xanthones decreased approximately fivefold in FGSC A4 ISS-grown samples (Supplementary Fig. S3f). In LO8158 samples, emericellamide and terrequinone production decreased (Supplementary Fig. S3b&e), while nidulanin and sterigmatocystin production increased in ISS grown samples (Supplementary Fig. S3c&d).

To date, most microbiological studies conducted in such environments have focused on changes occurring within bacteria or the microbiome as a whole (Tixador et al. 1985; Wilson et al. 2008; Checinska et al. 2015; Mora et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2018). Additionally, despite the various therapeutic and industrial applications of SMs, few studies have analyzed the global influence of space conditions on fungal secondary metabolism, as previous investigations have often focused on the production of a single SM (Lam et al. 1998; Lam et al. 2002; Benoit et al. 2006). Therefore, with the duration of space missions expected to increase, a major goal of this study was to investigate space-induced alternations in fungal ‘omics’ to identify specific adaptation biomarkers and acquire insight into potential benefits of fungi that may not be discernable using traditional methodology. This study revealed that the spacecraft environment alters the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. Five protein-coding genes displayed signatures of positive selection in the form of a high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous SNPs across all ISS-grown samples. These data stand in agreement with a study that investigated genomic alterations occurring in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus during spaceflight, in which missense mutations were clustered and occurred within only 9 protein-coding genes (Guo et al. 2015). High numbers of intergenic mutations were clustered near genes encoding transcriptional and translational machinery. One gene with several non-synonymous and two unique stop gain mutation encodes a putative retrotransposon, suggesting its suppression confers selective advantage during growth in spacecraft environments. Other missense and intergenic mutations were clustered within and around a specific region of the genome (AN0532-AN0538), suggesting that it underwent positive selection and therefore plays a role in adapting to the space environment. One of these genes also encoded an uncharacterized transposable element gene, underscoring the significance of alterations in transposable element activity in response to growth in ISS conditions. These findings are consistent with results from the aforementioned S. aureus study, as variations were also observed within a putative transposase (Guo et al. 2015). Interestingly, transposable element activity has been associated with stress response due to the novel variation it introduces into the genome (Capy et al. 2000). Future work should focus on characterizing the activities of the rest of these genes, as many of their functions remain unknown. Such knowledge may provide information key to elucidating the genetic adaptation mechanisms of fungi residing in spacecraft environments. Correlations linking genomic and proteomic data were observed with the two strains genetically engineered to increase SM production. Expsoure to the space environment appeared to curtail enhanced SM production in the laeA overexpression strain through the introduction of a point mutation that resulted in loss of the laeA stop codon, thereby activating nonstop decay degradation of laeA mRNA (Hoof et al. 2002; Klauer and van Hoof 2012). The ISS-induced down-regulation of laeA was also observed in the proteome of those samples, which exhibited an expression profile opposite that of the mcrA deletion strain for many proteins. Proteins involved in SM biosynthesis pathways regulated by laeA exhibited decreased and increased abundance in ISS-grown CW12001 and LO8158, respectively. The extensively studied protein LaeA forms a nuclear complex with VeA and VelB that coordinates secondary metabolism regulation with fungal development (Bayram et al. 2010). LaeA is often referred to as a global regulator of secondary metabolism (Bok and Keller 2016), and has been reported to also influence proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress response (Lv et al. 2018). Accordingly, several proteins involved in carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolic processes exhibited opposite protein expression profiles in LO8158 and CW12001. Regulation by laeA has been reported for some of these proteins in A. flavus, including endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, betaglycoside, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, and oxidative stress response proteins CatA and GstB (Lv et al. 2018). These findings verify the extensive regulatory role of laeA and highlight the complexity involved in identifying the laeA-controlled processes responsible for conferring selective advantage of the observed laeA stop lost mutation. This is compounded by reports that laeA also alters chromatin remodeling, cell growth and metabolism, conidiogenesis, conidialchain elongation, sporulation, pigmentation and colony hydrophobicity in various fungal species (Kosalková et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2012; Brakhage 2013; Lv et al. 2018). It is also possible that curtailing laeA overexpression is favored in ISS conditions to reduce energy expenditures in a stressful environment. ISS conditions significantly increased production of asperthecin, an anthraquinone pigment, in LO1362 and CW12001. Both mutants are deficient in NkuA production, which facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair, the favored DNA double strand break repair pathway in filamentous fungi (Krappmann 2007). We had anticipated that NkuA deficient strains would be particularly interesting in flight studies due to impairment of a preferred DNA repair pathway in a mutagenic, high-radiation environment. Additionally, deletion of the nkuA homolog has been reported to increase sensitivity toward gamma irradiation in other fungal species (Meyer et al. 2007). Although we cannot discriminate the specific ISS condition that induced asperthecin production in LO1362, we hypothesize that it served as an alternative protective mechanism from the high levels of radiation present on the ISS. Our observation stays in agreement with other reports suggesting that pigment production is a key adaptive response of fungi exposed to similar environments (Volz and Dublin 1973; Singaravelan et al. 2008; Dadachova and Casadevall 2008). It is therefore possible that asperthecin can be used to protect other forms of life present on the spacecraft. Cultivating plants for food in space will be crucial for the success of future space missions. However, space radiation can generate mutations in plant DNA, including base substitutions, deletions, and chromosomal alterations, which can result in genetic changes in seeds or tissue damage (Micco et al. 2011; Arena et al. 2014). The transformation of asperthecin biosynthesis genes into plants may potentially minimize plant DNA damage, and optimize plant and astronaut health. Future studies should be conducted both on ground and on the ISS to verify this hypothesis. Interestingly, space conditions did not increase asperthecin production in LO8158, which also possesses the nkuA- genetic background. Global regulation of SM production was altered to increase SM production in both LO8158 and CW12001, but the genetic alteration was reversed through a stop lost point mutation only in CW12001. It is therefore possible that alternative metabolomic protective mechanisms were sufficient in LO8158, and therefore asperthecin production was not enhanced in ISS conditions. Only a small proportion of proteins were differentially expressed in ISS-grown A. nidulans samples, which emphasizes the potential and safety of A. nidulans as a therapeutic production host during outer space missions. This finding may not hold true across the Aspergillus genus, as increased virulence has been reported in Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the ISS (Knox et al. 2016). Currently, if pharmaceutical stocks in space are depleted, a small, unmanned spacecraft is launched to restock crew supplies. In the era of long-term space travel, the duration of future space missions is expected to drastically increase. The inability to deliver required drugs to astronauts in a timely manner could result in serious complications. Through heterologous expression of specific genes, A. nidulans introduces the ability to biosynthesize a wide range of pharmaceutical drugs within a week, which could significantly improve astronauts’ safety during long-term manned space missions. In summary, this work has revealed the multi-omic response of the well-characterized model filamentous fungus, A. nidulans, to spacecraft conditions. These findings illustrate the potential of asperthecin to confer radiation resistance and of A. nidulans to be utilized as a small molecule production host in space. Further, specific genetic mutations involved in the adaptive mechanism of fungi in space environments were identified. Such knowledge may be valuable to NASA’s Space Biology Program (https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio) in planning for future outer space explorations.Supplementary Material Sup_1 MS1065202-supplement-Sup_1.pdf (35.2MB, pdf) ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.

INTRODUCTION The International Space Station (ISS) is a man-made closed habitat that functions as a platform to study the impact of the distinct space environment, which includes enhanced irradiation and microgravity on humans1–7, animals8,9, plants10–14 and microorganisms15–19. Most experiments conducted on board the ISS are precisely planned. Studied organisms are intentionally sent to the ISS to investigate the possible alterations in their physiology, using ground controls for comparison. However, one on-going ISS Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO) experiment focuses on studying hitchhikers that have followed humans and cargo aboard the ISS20. Thorough investigation of microbiological characteristics of closed habitats, like the ISS, are indispensable to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as manned long-term space flight missions are within reach. A deeper understanding of microbes that coexist in closed habitats with humans remains imperative to astronauts’ health and the overall maintenance of closed systems. Strict scrutiny of the microbiome and mycobiome of the ISS20–25, Mir26,27, and Skylab28, in the past, has revealed prevalence of fungal genera: Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus in space environments. These fungi can be both beneficial and detrimental to mankind, as they produce a myriad of commercially useful bioactive compounds29–34, while also causing allergies35, infections36,37 and biodeterioration of habitats38–40. Aspergillus fumigatus, one of many fungal isolates identified in a recent ISS-MO study22, is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus41. Its enormous adaptation capacity enables it to not only be omnipresent in the environment, but also to be a successful opportunistic pathogen42. A. fumigatus causes variety of health conditions spanning from allergies to potentially life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised individuals43,44. Initial characterization of two A. fumigatus ISS-isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, showed no outstanding differences in their genomes and secondary metabolites profiles when compared to clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293, however both isolates were significantly more lethal in a larval zebra fish model of IA45. Considering that A. fumigatus becomes more virulent in space and therefore potentially more dangerous to astronauts’ health, it was pertinent to further investigate molecular changes of ISS-isolated strains. Presented in this study are the unique differences observed in proteome of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, when compared to Af293 and CEA10. The goal of this study was to understand if the distinct environment of the ISS (low-nutrients, enhanced irradiation and microgravity) alters the proteome of A. fumigatus. Due to an existing gap in our understanding of how filamentous fungi molecularly adapt to space conditions, proteome investigation of these two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was prudent.2. METHODS 2.1. Isolation and identification of A. fumigatus. Procedures to isolate and identify A. fumigatus collected from the ISS were described previously45. In brief, HEPA filter associated particulates were scraped, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates22. Cupola surfaces were sampled with sterile polyester wipes assembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to space flight. After each sampling event on board the ISS, wipes were returned to JPL for subsequent processing. During that process, two of multiple isolates were identified via ITS region and subsequently whole genome sequencing (WGS) as A. fumigatus.2.2. Growth conditions. Af293, CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were cultivated for 5 days at 30°C on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 g/L NaNO3, 0.52 g/L KCl, 0.52 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g/L KH2PO4, 10 g/L D-glucose, 15 g/L agar supplemented with 1 mL/L of Hutner’s trace elements) covered with cellophane membrane. Each Petri plate (D=10 cm) was inoculated with 10*106 spores/plate. For supplementary comparison, each strain was also cultured in potato-dextrose (PD, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Czapek-dox (CD, BD Difco) liquid media for 2 days and 10 days, respectively.2.3. Protein extraction. Mycelia and spores from GMM agar plates were collected. The hyphae from the liquid media were collected on Whatman paper filter and washed with cell culture grade water. All samples were stored at −80 °C prior to protein extraction. The lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 μg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The hyphae from the liquid media were first homogenized on ice using a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Bohemia, NY) with a speed setting of 5 for 3–5 times (1 min/time, 30 sec pause). Subsequently, the crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2 mL cryotube with 0.5 mm glass beads three times (at 4 °C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 sec pauses in between). Mycelia from GMM were homogenized directly by bead beating due to their small volume. The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA).2.4. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. 200 μg proteins from each group were TCA-precipitated. Obtained protein pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolubilized in 25 μL TEAB (100 mM) and 25 μL 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Subsequently, proteins were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested overnight using mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). 40 μg of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (Af293 with TMT6-126, CEA10 with TMT6-127, ISSFT-021 with TMT6-128, and IF1SW-F4 with TMT6-130) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-131 label was used as a reference that contained an equal amount of peptides from each of the samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated into eight fractions using the Thermo Scientific Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1% (v/v) formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.2.5. LC-MS/MS analysis. An Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with the Thermo EASY-nLC ion source, 75 μm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and 75 μm × 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column was used to analyze the samples. Peptides were eluted at 45°C with a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3–30% solvent B (100 min), 30–50% solvent B (3 min), 50–90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400–1500) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2×105 in the Orbitrap with the 50 ms maximum injection time for MS scans. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with charge states 2–7, within a ±10 ppm mass window, using a 70 s dynamic exclusion function. MS2 scans (m/z 400–2000) were performed using the linear ion trap with the 35% CID collision energy. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid”, with an AGC target of 4×103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Subsequently, ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subjected to an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (m/z 100–500) generated the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a 55% collision energy, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5×103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.2.6. Proteome data processing. The Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Scientific) with searching engines Sequest-HT against an A. fumigatus Af293 protein database from  containing 9845 non-redundant sequences was used to search all MS/MS spectra. The following parameters: 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses were selected. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, whereas dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of peptide N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co-isolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from a protein was used to determine the total intensity of a reporter ion for that protein. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ions (TMT6–131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For the statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was Log2 transformed and technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. One-way ANOVA was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with p-value ≤ 0.05 were further evaluated for up- and down-regulation using a cut-off value of ≥ ±1 fold (Log2) change.3. RESULTS 3.1. Proteome analysis overview. Proteins with altered abundance in ISS-isolated strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, and clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10, were investigated upon extraction of total protein from each strain. Extracted proteins were digested into peptides and labeled using tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated, and analyzed via LC-MS/MS followed by spectrum/sequence matching using A. fumigatus Af293 protein database (). The abundance ratios of all identified proteins were normalized to Af293, that enabled identification of 553, 464 and 626 increased and 314, 289 and 317 decreased in abundance proteins in CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 strains respectively (Table S-1, Figure S-1). When compared to both, Af293 and CEA10, 60 proteins showed increased and 32 decreased abundance in space strains only (fold change (FC) > |2|) (Table S-2). AspGD GO Slim terms46 were used to study the distribution of differentially abundant proteins in space strains. Analysis of proteins with increased abundance revealed involvement of 14 proteins in carbohydrate metabolic processes, eight in stress responses, five in secondary metabolism and toxins biosynthesis, and two in pathogenesis whereas five, three, one and zero proteins showed respectively decreased abundance in these categories. Proteins associated with cellular amino acid metabolic process (6), lipid cellular homeostasis (3), metabolic processes (2), pathogenesis (2), and translation (2) exhibited increased abundance in space strains only (Figure 1). FungiDB47 was used to carry out GO term enrichment analysis to gain a general understanding of biological processes possibly affected by unique environment of the ISS. The results revealed that significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included secondary metabolic processes (40% of all up-regulated proteins), carbohydrate metabolic processes (23%), and response to chemical (~15%), whereas significantly over-represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), response to heat (6%), and mRNA metabolic processes (6%) (Table S-3). F1. AspGD GO Slim terms of proteins differentially expressed in space strains when compared to Af293 and CEA10. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 are categorized into GO Slim categories using AspGD. Categories containing at least 2 up- or down-regulated proteins are presented.3.2. Secondary metabolism and toxins. The proteomic analysis revealed altered abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Table 1). Proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, including emodin O-methyltransferase TpcA (AFUA_4G14580), glutathione S-transferase TpcF (AFUA_4G14530), and dehydratase TpcK (AFUA_4G14470)48–50, were at least threefold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains than in clinical isolates. Arp1 (AFUA_2G17580), a scytalone dehydratase involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis51–53 was threefold more abundant, whereas Asp-hemolysin (Asp-HS; AFUA_3G00590)54 was eight times more abundant in ISS strains.

Examination of the production yields of monomethylsulochrin, the final intermediate in trypacidin biosynthesis, (trypacidin is not detectable until 7–8 days of growth50) showed ~600% and ~200% increased production in ISSFT-021 ad IF1SW-F4, respectively (Figure S-2). Additionally, proteome of clinical and ISS strains was examined in liquid CD and PD media and confirmed significant up-regulation of AspHS (Table S-4). Lastly, observed differences in sporulation capacity between the strains do not seem to be directly correlated with conidiaassociated protein expression levels (Figure S-3), suggesting that the observed variations are due to exposure to space environment rather than different growth rates.3.3. Stress response. Among proteins with altered abundance, 11 were involved in the stress response of A. fumigatus (Table 2). AFUA_5G11430, a quinone oxidoreductase, and Pst2 (AFUA_1G02820), an NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, involved in oxidative stress response were three and four times more abundant in space strains. Erythromycin esterase, AFUA_1G05850, and 3’ exoribonuclease AFUA_2G1598056 were at least twofold more abundant in ISS strains. Among proteins with decreased abundance several were heat shock proteins including Scf1 (AFUA_1G17370)57,58, and Awh11 (AFUA_6G12450)56. Other down-regulated protein was dehydrin-like protein DprA (AFUA_4G00860) that is known to play a role in oxidative stress response59. Table 2.

Carbohydrate metabolic processes. Comparative analysis of proteomes of ISS-isolated strains, IF1SW-F4 and ISST-021, with clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293 revealed changes in abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (Table 3). Pyruvate decarboxylase PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), which catalyzes the first step in anaerobic conversion of pyruvate to ethanol60, was about three times more abundant in space strains when compared to clinical isolates. Proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, including glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730), and glycerol kinase AFUA_4G1154055 were at least 2.5-fold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains. AFUA_5G10540 and AFUA_1G02140, which are homologues of A. niger An14g04190 and GdbA (An01g06120)61, respectively, and involved in glycogen biosynthesis and metabolism were at least twofold more abundant. Protein abundance of AFUA_3G08470, AFUA_4G08880, AFUA_7G_01830, and AFUA_1G14710 involved in glucose metabolism, increased twofold at minimum. Both, the 14–3-3 family protein ArtA (AFUA_2G03290)62 and malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540)63 were threefold more abundant when compared to clinical isolates. At minimum twofold increased abundance of phosphoketolase (AFUA_3G00370) and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910)64 was observed. Among the decreased in abundance proteins were hydrolase Exg17 (AFUA_6G14490)65 and β−1,3-glucan modifying enzyme Sun1 (AFUA_7G05450)66. Table 3.

DISCUSSION The proteome of A. fumigatus has been studied under various conditions, including short-67, and long-term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58. However, in this report we present unique proteome differences observed in the two ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates. To date, there is no report which elucidates the molecular response of filamentous fungi to the distinct environment of the ISS, despite previous reports of their presence on board of the ISS22 and Mir27,71. In-depth understanding of alterations triggered in the proteome of omnipresent A. fumigatus remains imperative for astronauts’ health, as it is an opportunistic pathogen that affects individuals with impaired immune system functions41. Both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains displayed higher abundance of several proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthesis. Trypacidin is a potent mycotoxin produced by A. fumigatus conidia. It has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against A549 alveolar lung cells suggesting its importance during the infection76. Further, it has been reported that A. fumigatus conidia with disrupted production of trypacidin exhibit higher susceptibility to macrophage clearance49. Increased abundance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of trypacidin in both ISS–isolated strains may be possible cause of the reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates45. Moreover, emodin and questin, precursors of trypacidin, are pigmented anthraquinones that have been reported to have a protective effect against UV in other organisms (Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica) that produce these types of compounds50,77. It is therefore reasonable to assume that up-regulation of trypacidin production may be another adaptation to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, however this hypothesis has to be validated by further experiments. Further, the level of Asp-HS, which is a known toxin produced by A. fumigatus54,78 was highly increased in both ISS-isolates. While several studies have reported its hemolytic79 and cytotoxic80,81 activities in the past, a recent report showed lack of attenuated virulence when Asp-HS gene was deleted82. This discrepancy may be strain specific as the studies used different A. fumigatus strains to carry out the experiments or related to experimental models used in both studies, as at times results observed for in vitro analyses do not correlated with the outcomes observed in in vivo studies. The exact role of Asp-HS in the pathogenicity remains to be determined during future studies. Nonetheless, increased abundance of Asp-HS observed in both ISS-isolated strains appears to be a part of the A. fumigatus adaptation response to the unique ISS environment. One of the increased in abundance proteins in ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was Arp1, which is one of the six enzymes involved in the DHN-melanin production51–53. Arp1 disruption resulted in production of reddish pink conidia with induced C3 binding that led to phagocytosis and killing of conidial spores during infection51,52. Increased abundance of Arp1 protein may, therefore, be another cause of the previously reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model45. Additionally, higher AlbA abundance, involved in DHN-melanin production72, was observed in JSC-093350089 A. niger isolated from the ISS73. Seemingly, both ISS-isolated species, A. fumigatus and A. niger, responded with increased melanin production to enhanced irradiation on board of the ISS. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of increased melanin production in fungi isolated from high-radiation environments such as the Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites or “Evolution Canyon”74,75. However, because none of the other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis showed increased abundance when compared to both clinical isolates simultaneously, further assessment of melanin production is necessary to definitively conclude its increased production under ISS conditions. Proteome analysis of both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains revealed altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress response. ArtA, a regulatory protein, was reported to be increased in abundance in response to incubation with H2O2, suggesting its importance in overcoming oxidative stress62. Pst2, which is also present in Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was shown to be induced in response to oxidative stress83,84. Additionally, Pst2 was reported to be a post-translational modification target protein that is ubiquitinated under peroxide stress conditions in C. albicans85. Interestingly, such post-translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage86. These data are in agreement with previous reports of induced oxidative stress response in humans, mice and yeast while in space87–91. Overall, increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was also observed in Acinetobacter sp. Ver3 when exposed to UV irradiation92 and JSC-093350089 A. niger73. Although increased abundance of several oxidative stress-correlated proteins was observed in this study, it was previously reported that ISS-isolated strains were more resistant than Af293 to H2O2 exposure, but less resistant than CEA10, suggesting no adaptation45. Among the more abundant proteins in both ISS-isolated strains several were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540) is one of the three key enzymes involved in glyoxylate cycle63, which has been shown to be crucial for fungal growth on C2 compounds and fatty acids as a sole carbon source93. In our earlier study it was documented that these two ISS-isolated strains significantly outgrew both clinical isolates45. Further, more abundant PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), a pyruvate decarboxylase, has been shown to be involved in ethanol fermentation60. These data therefore suggest possible adaptation of A. fumigatus to low-nutrient environment of the ISS20,22, which is in agreement with changes observed in proteome of A. fumigatus during starvation94. Similarly, up-regulation of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger73. This study presents comparative proteomic analysis of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinically established isolates Af293 and CEA10. Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report that focused on studying the proteomic changes in filamentous fungus isolated from on board of the ISS. Complex analyses of possible molecular alterations triggered by microgravity and enhanced irradiation will be pertinent to the future long-term manned space flights, as such an understanding is crucial for astronauts’ health and biodeterioration of the closed habitat.

KEYWORDS: Fusarium, International Space Station, fungi, genomicsABSTRACT Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured from the dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses using EF-1α sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study. IMPORTANCE This is the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.INTRODUCTION Fusarium oxysporum is a presumed asexual, filamentous fungus ubiquitous in soil and infamous for causing vascular wilt and root rot disease in many economically important plants and crops (1). While the number of hosts this species can infect is extensive (tomatoes, bananas, cotton, strawberries, eggplants, tulips, soybean, beets, and chrysanthemum, to name only a few) (2), individual isolates show a high degree of host specificity and are assigned to formae speciales (f. sp.) based on the host it can infect (3). For example, F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense causes fungal wilt in bananas (“Panama disease”) while f. sp. melonis, f. sp. tulipae, and f. sp. cucumerimum infect and cause disease in melons, tulips, and cucumbers, respectively. At present, there are approximately 150 formae speciales (i.e., host-specific groups of strains) that have been described (2). While well known as a phytopathogen, F. oxysporum can also cause infections in humans, ranging from superficial and localized (skin, nail, cornea, and superficial wound) in immunocompetent individuals to invasive and disseminated (blood culture, deep tissue involvement, or isolation of strain from two or more body sites) in immunocompromised patients (4–6). Since members of the fungal genus Fusarium are intrinsically resistant to most available antifungals on the market (7), prognosis is often poor and sometimes fatal for those afflicted with systemic fusariosis (6, 8). Fungi are known to produce many bioactive molecules that can benefit humans, such as antimicrobials, antialgals, immunosuppressants, compounds cytotoxic to cancer cells, insecticides, and antioxidants (9–11), and F. oxysporum is no exception. F. oxysporum isolated from the plants Smallanthus sonchifolius and Catharanthus roseus were shown to produce, in appreciable amounts, the anticancer drugs anhydrofusarubin and beauvericin (12) and vinblastine and vincristine (13), respectively. An isolate of F. oxysporum cultured from Juniperus recurva was shown to produce the aryltetralin lignin podophyllotoxin (14), which is a precursor for the chemical synthesis of anticancer drugs like etoposide, teniposide, and etopophose (15, 16). Podophyllotoxin is also known for its antiviral (17) and antiparasitic (18) activity. In an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), two F. oxysporum isolates were cultured from the dining table in the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes of these two isolates were sequenced and compared to 65 other F. oxysporum isolates. The predicted proteins were annotated and mined for the presence of secondary metabolites and putative virulence factors. The virulence of these isolates in an immunocompromised (MAPKK-deficient) Caenorhabditis elegans model of invasive fusariosis was also assessed. This is the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment as well as one that has been exposed to space.RESULTS Two F. oxysporum isolates (designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4) were cultured from the dining table of the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes were paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in 48 million (ISS-F3) and 42 million (ISS-F4) reads. These paired-end reads were de novo assembled into scaffolds (k-mer size = 86) using ABySS (version 2.0.2) (19). The assembled genome size for ISS-F3 was 53.6 Mb and for ISS-F4 was 53.8 Mb, which is comparable to the genome size of the model strain, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain 4287 (59.9 Mb) (20). Table 1 provides general assembly statistics of the draft genomes of F. oxysporum ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. TABLE 1.

The conserved marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) was used to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of ISS-F3/F4 to 62 other F. oxysporum strains, belonging to various formae speciales, and seven strains belonging to other Fusarium species included as outgroups, based on clonal (asexual) vertical inheritance. EF-1α allows for phylogenetic species recognition because it is applicable across Fusarium and it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus (21). Based on EF-1α phylotyping, F. oxysporum can be divided into 3 distinct clades with various clonal lineages within each clade (22, 23). The phylogenetic tree inferred in Fig. 1A clusters ISS-F3/F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to 4 other strains: three members of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and the non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same sequence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in Fig. 1A because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from ISS-grown Zinnia hybrida plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2), and IMV00293, cultured at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 12 years after the explosion. The ISS Z. hybrida strains fell into a different branch from ISS-F3/F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293. FIG 1. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic relationship of ISS-F3/F4 among other F. oxysporum isolates. (A) The phylogenetic tree constructed from EF-1α sequences of 62 F. oxysporum isolates places ISS-F3/F4 in clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage shared by lycopersici_016, lycopersici_072, lycopersici_075, and Fo47. Other Fusarium species (bottom) were included to root the tree. The bootstrap confidence (in percent; 1,000 replicates performed) is shown in red numbers in the tree. (B) Presence/absence profiles of ISS-F3/F4 with 62 other strains based on 104 candidate effector proteins. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a particular effector gene, with gray indicating its absence in the genome. The list of effector genes is shown in Data Set S4. Formae speciales that cause disease in the same host cluster together, as seen by the groupings of green (cucurbit-infecting strains), red (tomato-infecting strains), and yellow (banana-infecting strains). Dark gray represents non-plant-pathogenic isolates, and pink represents strains isolated from or flown to the ISS. Blue represents other plant pathogens. ISS-F3/F4 contained relatively few effector genes compared to the number found in the plant pathogens (green, red, yellow, and blue) and showed the most similar pattern (number and type) to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate with a biocontrol function.F. oxysporum genomes consist of a “core” set of housekeeping genes and an “accessory” genome which is not required for vegetative growth but contains most of, if not all, the genes that allow the fungus to invade and cause disease in a host plant (20). Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that these effectors are often identical within a forma specialis (24). This indicates that the accessory genome, specifically the effector genes residing in these regions, can be used to identify formae speciales within the F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC), including newly encountered strains (24). Figure 1B shows the hierarchical clustering of presence/absence patterns of 104 effector sequences in ISS-F3/F4 along with 62 other strains. The effector profile of ISS-F3/F4 was the most similar to Fo47 (a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate that has been shown to exert a biocontrol function) (25) with similarities to another non-plant-pathogenic isolate, MN25, and CL57 (NRRL 26381), an isolate causing root rot in tomato, also known as NRRL 26381. The ISS-F3/F4 strains do not contain as many effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do not possess any of the SIX genes (see top panel of Fig. 1B), which encode secreted fungal proteins that were first discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and have a well-studied role in plant pathogenesis (26, 27).Relationship between ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Further analyses were conducted to determine how closely related ISS-F3 and ISS-F4 were to each other. The sequences of 10 phylogenetically informative loci (28) were compared between the two strains, and for all 10 loci, the sequences were identical between ISS-F3/F4. Second, a BLAST comparison was performed using contigs above 2 kb for each strain. Using ISS-F3 as the query, each of the 682 contigs matched a contig in ISS-F4 with either 99% or 100% identity with an E value of 0. Last, when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed against the reference genome Fo47, ISS-F3/F4 had the same single nucleotide variants. For this reason, it is believed that ISS-F3/F4 are clonal derivatives of each other.Strain identification. Based on EF-1α phylogeny (Fig. 1A) and the presence/absence of effector proteins (Fig. 1B), ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47. To determine whether the ISS strains were Fo47 or represented a distinct strain, two in silico genomic comparisons were conducted.(i) k-mer comparison. The KMC2 k-mer counter (29) was used to generate 50-bp long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material). The k-mers generated from each genome were compared against the k-mers from all other genomes to find the ones that were specific to each of the 65 genomes analyzed. From all genome-specific k-mers that were identified, a subset was chosen from each genome to create the F. oxysporum k-mer database. These sequences were chosen based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). The sequences making up this database are listed in Table S2. TABLE S2F. oxysporum k-mer database. The sequences shown represent the 50-bp k-mer sequences that are unique to each strain and not present in the other 64 strains examined. Download Table S2, TXT file, 0.05 MB (19.7KB, txt) .

The assembled genomes of ISS-F3/F4 were then compared using BLAST against the F. oxysporum k-mer database, and for ISS-F3/F4 to be considered one of the 65 F. oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a specific strain had to have a perfect match in the genome. For example, all k-mers generated for strain Fo47 in the database needed to match sequences in either the ISS-F3 or -F4 genome 100% (i.e., 50-bp k-mer/50-bp genome [no mismatches]) for ISS-F3 or -F4 to be considered Fo47. None of the Fo47 unique k-mer sequences matched sequences in the ISS-F3 or ISS-F4 genome, and only 1 k-mer from strains radicis-lycopersici 26381 (CL57), UASWS AC1, lycopersici Fol074, and melonis Fom009 found an exact match. Based on the criteria above, ISS-F3/F4 were not the same strain as Fo47 nor any of the other 64 strains tested.(ii) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SNP genotyping was the second in silico comparative method used to determine the relatedness of the ISS isolates to that of Fo47. Using Fo47 as the reference genome, the number of SNPs in the genomes of ISS-F3/F4 compared to Fo47 was calculated, along with other strains as a comparison. These additional strains are listed in Table S3 in Data Set S5, along with the reasons for choosing them. Phylogenies of these isolates inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in coding regions across every genome indicate that they are distinct from Fo47 and the other strains included (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with SNPs across the entire genome (coding and noncoding regions) (data not shown). A summary of the total number of SNPs across the genome, the number of SNPs in coding regions, and the number of SNPs in noncoding regions is displayed in Fig. 2B. The total numbers of SNPs in ISS-F3/F4 were 150,000 and 152,000, which are more than lycopersici Fol016 and radicis-lycopersici 26381 (also known as CL57), which are well-defined, characterized strains, known to be different than Fo47.

(A) Maximum likelihood tree constructed from SNPs found in the coding regions of the genomes of ISS-F3, ISS-F4, and 8 other F. oxysporum strains (see Table S3 in Data Set S5 for reasons for inclusion in analysis). ISS-F3/F4 form their own clonal lineage distinct from Fo47 and the other strains. A similar tree was inferred when all SNPs across the genome were analyzed. (B) The frequency of SNPs across the entire genome (black), the noncoding region of the genome (purple), and the coding region of the genome (yellow) is summarized in the bar graph. Fol016 and 26381, well-defined strains, known to be different than Fo47, had a lower frequency of SNPs than ISS-F3/F4.Annotation of ISS-F3/F4 genes. Using the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS (30), ISS-F3 was predicted to contain 16,648 genes and ISS-F4 had 16,729 genes. This number is very close to the predicted number of genes (17,735) for the model strain, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287 (20, 31). The predicted genes were annotated with BLAST2GO, and 47% of the genes in ISS-F3 and 56% in ISS-F4 could be matched to known proteins while the remaining genes were listed as hypothetical (Data Sets S1 and S2). Among the predicted genes, 273 genes in ISS-F3 and 76 genes in ISS-F4 had no similarity to fungal genes in the  database (Data Sets S1 and S2) and could possibly represent novel, unidentified fungal proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation was also performed with BLAST2GO, and 65% of the predicted genes in ISS-F3 and 68% in ISS-F4 could be assigned a function (Data Sets S1 and S2). The most frequently represented GO functional assignments were metabolic and cellular processes (category: biological processes), catalytic activity and binding (category: metabolic function), and membrane and membrane part components (category: cellular component) (Fig. 3A). A summary of the 50 most abundant GO terms in each of the 3 categories mentioned above is presented in Fig. S1. Approximately 15% of the predicted genes were classified as enzymes, with hydrolases dominating followed by transferases (Fig. 3B). FIG 3. Open in a new tab Summary of gene ontology (GO) annotation of the predicted genes in ISS-F3/F4. Predicted genes in ISS-F3/F4 were predicted using AUGUSTUS and then annotated using Blast2GO. Functions could be assigned to 10,789 of the 16,648 genes in ISS-F3 and 11,305 of the 16,729 genes in ISS-F4. (A) Bar charts summarizing the most abundant GO terms for ISS-F3. BP, biological processes; MF, metabolic function; CC, cellular components. (B) Bar charts summarizing the abundance of enzyme classes in ISS-F3. NB, ISS-F3/F4 had the same distributions of GO and enzyme class abundances, and thus, only ISS-F3 is shown for simplicity. The distributions in ISS-F3/F4 were similar to Fo47 (non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate) and FOSC-3a (clinical isolate) (data not shown). FIG S1GO annotation of F. oxysporum ISS-F3/F4 strains.

Protein families were classified and domains predicted with InterProScan, and 91% of the predicted proteins in ISS-F3/F4 could be assigned a function. Abundant protein domains in ISS-F3/F4 were the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, the Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain, the fungal transcription factor domain, the ankyrin repeat-containing domain, and the protein kinase domain (Fig. 4A). The abundant protein families were the NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily, MFS transporter superfamily, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain superfamily, and the alpha/beta hydrolase fold (Fig. 4B). A comparison was performed between the ISS strains isolated during this study and a non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). While the most abundant domains and families in ISS-F3/F4 were also the most abundant ones in Fo47 and FOSC-3a, the collective proportions differed, with Fo47 and FOSC-3a more similar to each other than to ISS-F3/F4 (Fig. 4). There were also many domains and families that were present in Fo47 and FOSC-3a that were not found in the ISS-F3/F4 genomes and vice versa (Fig. S2). Data Set S3 shows the full list of protein domains and families present in each of the different strains and the relative abundances of each within each genome. FIG 4.

Identification of candidate pathogenicity proteins and secondary metabolites. Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large, multidomain protein complexes that catalyze the sequential production of a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SM) with a range of biological activities, including pigmentation, plant growth regulation, plant pathogenicity/invasion, and toxicity toward humans and animals, with some having potential for drug development and human benefit (32–34). Different PKSs catalyze the synthesis of structurally distinct polyketides, and to date 52 PKSs have been identified in Fusarium with 16 found in F. oxysporum (35). Due to the importance of PKS in SM production, predicted proteins composed of PKS domains, based on the InterProScan results above, were further studied to identify which PKSs (and the resulting polyketides) ISS-F3/F4 have the potential to express. The amino acid sequences of ISS-F3/F4 proteins with PKS domains were compared using BLAST against a database composed of PKSs identified from 12 strains of F. oxysporum and 9 other Fusarium species (35). The BLAST searches revealed the presence of 11 PKSs in the genomes of ISS-F3/F4 which have all been detected in other F. oxysporum strains (Fig. 5). Compared to the 12 F. oxysporum strains, the presence/absence PKS profile of ISS-F3/F4 best resembled that of Fo47, followed by FOSC-3a (Fig. 5). In addition to the 11 PKS proteins identified in ISS-F3/F4, there were two proteins with ketoacyl synthase domains that did not match anything in the database and could possibly represent novel, yet-unidentified Fusarium PKSs. FIG 5. Open in a new tab Presence/absence profile of polyketide synthases (PKSs) detected in the genomes of ISS-F3/F4. The sequences of predicted genes that had a ketoacyl synthase domain (one of 3 essential domains in polyketide synthases [PKSs]) were compared with BLAST against a PKS database (35) to determine which PKSs ISS-F3/F4 had the ability to produce. Eleven PKSs found in ISS-F3/F4 are also present in 12 other F. oxysporum species that have been previously studied (35). However, there were two additional PKSs, unkA and unkB, in ISS-F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the database. The first column represents the PKS, the last column shows the polyketide that the PKS makes (if known), and the middle columns indicate the F. oxysporum strains. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a specific PKS in the genome.

NB, the sequences are identical between ISS-F3/F4.A more extensive SM assessment was performed with antiSMASH, which identified 47 biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome of ISS-F3 and 46 in ISS-F4. To put this finding into perspective, 44 biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in Fo47 while 47 clusters were present in the FOSC-3a. All four strains had biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes that are involved in the production of type 1 polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, indoles, terpenes, and polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrids. While ISS-F3, ISS-F4, and Fo47 had clusters involved in type III polyketide production, FOSC-3a did not appear to have that machinery in its genome. A summary of the biosynthetic gene clusters detected in the ISS-F3, ISS-F4, Fo47, and FOSC-3a genomes is shown in Fig. S3. FIG S3A comparison of biosynthetic gene clusters in F. oxysporum strains. Biosynthetic gene clusters, and thus the ability to produce secondary metabolites, were analyzed in ISS-F3/F4 using antiSMASH. Included for comparison were the biosynthetic gene clusters in Fo47 (a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate) and FOSC-3a (a clinical isolate). The boxes with numbers listed to the right of the strain name indicate the number of clusters in the genome for that specific type (i.e., for T1pks there were 7 clusters in strain ISS-F3). The letters indicate the name of the compound produced or the name of the polyketide synthase (PKS) or nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). Download FIG S3, PDF file, 0.2 MB (238.9KB, pdf) .

Virulence of F. oxysporum strains estimated in C. elegans model. F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain 4287, a well-characterized model pathogen of tomato plants, was shown to produce systemic disease in immunocompromised mice, resulting in a high death rate (36). Utilizing F. oxysporum strain 4287 knockout mutants that exhibit altered virulence in tomato plants, it was shown that certain virulence factors essential in plant pathogenesis were dispensable in mammalian pathogenesis and vice versa (36). This raises the possibility that certain phytopathogens could also be virulent in humans depending on their health status. This is concerning given the fact that a recent study on the impact of space on fungal pathogenesis has shown that Aspergillus fumigatus isolates cultured from ISS surfaces were more virulent in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis than Earth-based clinical isolates (37). This prompted the examination of the virulence potential of ISS-F3/F4 in an immunocompromised (MAPKK-deficient) C. elegans model of invasive fusariosis. Included for comparison was an F. oxysporum strain, IMV00293, isolated in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, flown to the ISS and grown for 12 days (“293gr”), and grown concomitantly on Earth (“293sp”). Figure 6 demonstrates the effect of five strains of F. oxysporum on mortality of C. elegans AU37. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of C. elegans analyzed with the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test demonstrated that the virulence of F. oxysporum ISS-F4 was significantly greater than other strains (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 6A). The culturing conditions for fungal growth such as growing without antibiotic or with antibiotic used to prepare conidia did not affect ISS-F4 killing ability (P = 0.6888). The majority of worms died due to F. oxysporum hyphae piercing through the worm body (Fig. 6B); however, ISS-F4 virulence was attributed to both hypha- and non-hypha-related killing (Fig. 6C), whereas ISS-F3 virulence was attributed solely to hypha-related mortality (Fig. 6D). The hypha-related killing of ISS-F4 was still significantly greater than other strains (P = 0.0129) (Fig. 6B). Importantly, while ISS-F3, 293gr, and 293sp had less killing capability than ISS-F4, they should be still considered virulent, as their related mortality for worms reached 50% at 50 h. To note, there were no differences in mortality between 293gr and 293sp, indicating that growth on the ISS (12 days) did not change the virulence of this strain. Figure 7 shows microscopic images of C. elegans worms with hypha penetration, 22 h and 46 h after exposure to ISS-F4 conidia. FIG 6. Open in a new tab Virulence of Fusarium oxysporum strains in C. elegans AU37 model. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine total death of worms caused by F. oxysporum strains (n = 90 worms per fungal strain, results accumulated from 3 different experiments, 3 biological replicates per experiment, 10 worms per replicate). P < 0.0001 for F4 and F4antib compared to all other strains. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine the hypha-related death of worms (n = 90 worms per fungal strain, results accumulated from 3 different experiments, 3 biological replicates per experiment, 10 worms per replicate). P = 0.0129 for F4 and F4antib compared to all other strains. (C and D) Comparison of hypha-related and total deaths of C. elegans caused by ISS-F4 (C) and ISS-F3 (D). Total deaths of C. elegans caused by ISS-F4 were significantly higher than the deaths associated with hyphae piercing through the body (P = 0.0102, n = 90, log rank [Mantel-Cox] test). There is no statistical difference between total and hypha-related deaths caused by ISS-F3 (P = 0.2465, n = 90). NB, 293sp is the IMV00293 strain that was isolated from Chernobyl and grown on the ISS for 12 days, and 293gr is IMV00293 that was concomitantly grown for 12 days on Earth.FIG 7.

Dotted arrows show growing extended hyphae that initially penetrated from the intestinal tube. The images were taken with the Olympus SZX16 microscope (×5 magnification).DISCUSSION This study presents the genomic analysis of two F. oxysporum isolates, cultured from the ISS, during an ongoing microbial tracking study. The phylogenetic placement of these two strains based on EF-1α nucleotide sequence and whole-genome SNPs shows that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability to thrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation. F. oxysporum strains are well known for their plant pathogenicity, and for successful infection of its plant host, effector proteins are secreted from the fungus that aid in the colonization process. Performing disease assays to determine host specificity is both laborious and time-consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method based on 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict host specificity in F. oxysporum (24). The presence/absence of these effector proteins in ISS-F3/F4 was determined and compared to 62 other strains from a variety of formae speciales. The ISS strains contained relatively few candidate effector genes compared to phytopathogens, with numbers similar to that detected in two non-plant-pathogenic strains, Fo47 and MN14. The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14 secreted in xylem (SIX) effector genes, which encode cysteine-rich secreted proteins that appear to manipulate host defenses to promote infection (38). Based on the effector content, it is unlikely that ISS-F3/F4 are plant pathogens. VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, isolated from Z. hybrida plants grown on the ISS and whole-genome sequences (39) also displayed relatively few effector genes (Fig. 1B) and were unable to infect healthy Z. hybrida plants (G. Massa, personal communication). Based on effector content and EF-1α phylogeny, ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate known for its biocontrol properties. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in both coding and noncoding regions, and the k-mer analysis, ISS-F3/F4 were not Fo47 or identical to any of the 65 strains compared in this study. Thus, it appears that these ISS isolates represent a genomically unique strain, which has not yet been identified and characterized to date. The ISS is a hermetically sealed system, closed off from its surrounding environment, with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads. ISS-F3/F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question why they had been identified only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150 formae speciales have already been characterized (2). One hypothesis is that ISS-F3/F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to withstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which compared to terrestrial indoor buildings, is 100 times greater. In a recent study by Byrne et al., it was found that Escherichia coli developed extreme resistance to ionizing radiation, comparable to that observed with Deinococcus radiodurans, with mutations in only 9 genes, all of which happen to be involved in radiation resistance (40). When these mutations were repaired, resistance was lost and the cells became sensitive to radiation (40). This paper showed for the first time that evolution of resistance may occur via genetic adaptation rather than passive mechanisms based on changes in cellular proteins. We therefore hypothesized that based on the sequences of five genes known to have a role in radiation resistance in fungi, ISS-F3/F4 would appear to be more closely related to IMV00293 (Chernobyl isolate) and VEG-01C1/VEG-01C2 (ISS Z. hybrida isolates) (as they are strains also isolated from high-radiation environments) compared to 64 other F. oxysporum strains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences of rad54, rad53, rad51, rad2, and phr1 (a photolyase) found in ISS-F3, ISS-F4, IMV00293, VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and 64 other F. oxysporum strains. The branching observed with the radiation resistance genes was similar to that observed with EF-1α in which ISS-F3/F4 grouped together, apart from IMV00293, VEG-01C1, and VEF-01C2, which grouped together, with all five isolates being within the genetic variation of the 64 other strains included (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). A proteomics approach may provide more insight into whether ISS-F3/F4 have a selective advantage for survival on the ISS and what that may entail. FIG S4Sequence comparison of radiation resistance genes among 69 F. oxysporum strains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences of rad54, rad53, rad51, rad2, and phr1 (a photolyase), genes that have been shown to play a role in radiation resistance in fungi. Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium fujikuroi were used to root the tree. Since ISS-F3, ISS-F4, IMV00293, VEG-01C1, and VEG-01C2 were all cultured from radiation-rich environments, it was hypothesized that they would share similar sequences in these genes, distinct from the other 65 F. oxysporum strains. However, as the tree shows, this was not the case. Download FIG S4, PDF file, 0.05 MB (51.4KB, pdf) . Copyright © 2019 Urbaniak et al.

The genomes of ISS-F3/F4 were largely made up of gene ontology categories involved in metabolic and cellular processes and catalytic activity and binding. Overall, the relative abundances of GO categories for ISS-F3/F4 were similar to that observed in FOSC-3a, a clinical isolate, and Fo47, a biocontrol, non-plant-pathogenic strain. However, there were differences in the relative abundances and presence/absence of protein domains and families between ISS-F3/F4 and FOSC-3a and Fo47, highlighting the uniqueness of these strains. One such difference was the higher relative abundance of genes encoding polyketide synthase domains in ISS-F3/F4. Each PKS makes a unique polyketide, which collectively represent structurally diverse natural products with commercial significance for the pharmaceutical industries (41). A testament to its importance is reflected in the annual sales of pharmaceuticals derived from polyketides, which routinely reach $20 billion (42). For example, the anticancer drugs tetracycline and doxorubicin, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, the antibiotics erythromycin and rifamycin, and the fungicide strobilurin are all polyketides that have been isolated from either bacteria or fungi (43). A BLAST search against a PKS database (35) showed that ISS-F3/F4 had the genomic machinery to produce 13 polyketides, 11 of which have been found in other F. oxysporum strains. The two sequences in ISS-F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the PKS database did match F. oxysporum hypothetical proteins in . A more extensive analysis using proteomics and metabolomics will be performed to elucidate the natural product repertoire of ISS-F3/F4. F. oxysporum, though a well-known plant pathogen, may cause various infections in humans and is a cause of emerging infections in immunodeficient patients (44–46). Vertebrate and nonvertebrate models are well established to test pathogens for their potential virulence (36, 47–49). For virulence testing of F. oxysporum, a host is usually immunosuppressed to make it susceptible to fungal infection (50). Symptoms of disseminated fusariosis caused by F. oxysporum are remarkably similar between animals and humans. They include development of invasive structures, including hypha microconidia and chlamydospores, causing massive colonization of organs, and which can cause thrombosis and necrosis (4, 50, 51). The nonvertebrate host C. elegans, a free-living soil nematode, is one of the most useful models to study the virulence of fungi and is well established by many researchers (52–54). C. elegans has an innate immune response mechanism that is activated in the response to pathogens, including fungi (55, 56). A key component of the C. elegans immune response is the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (57). SEK-1 encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in this pathway and thus plays a vital role in pathogen resistance in C. elegans (58). For this reason, SEK-1 mutants are considered “immunocompromised” worms. Matricidal hatching of progeny inside the parent worms occurs in SEK-1-deficient C. elegans, and therefore, a mutation in glp-4, a locus required for normal proliferation of the germ line (59), is required to avoid bias effects due to progeny hatching. The glp-4 mutants are sterile at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, at which C. elegans experiments are performed. Using the glp-4/sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, we observed that ISS-F4 was the most virulent, even compared to ISS-F3, despite the fact that ISS-F3/F4 have very similar genomes and initially were thought to be clonal derivatives of each other. Since ISS-F4 demonstrated killing ability by both hypha piercing-related and -unrelated mechanisms, it is likely that it produces secreted virulence factors. It is known that secreted proteins such as RP-1-like (60) and secreted in xylem (SIX) proteins (61), which are regulated by Fusarium transcription factor 1 (FTF1) (62), are required for full virulence of F. oxysporum. Further work is required to determine if there are differences in production and regulation of the secreted factors between ISS-F3/F4 strains and if time-dependent exposure to the ISS environment may affect this regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of fungal strains. Surfaces (1 m2) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9-in. by 9-in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbial tracking study during flight sampling 3 (6 May 2016). Wipes were stored at room temperature (RT) before being brought back to Earth, 6 days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously (63). Material from the wipes was plated, 100 μl, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Fusarium oxysporum, identified by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The two isolates were designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4.Whole-genome sequencing. (i) Genomic DNA extraction. Freezer stocks of ISS-F3/F4 were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days, at which time the entire plate was covered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar and pestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and then transferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalog number 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturer’s instructions, except for the last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80 μl of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at −20°C until sent for sequencing.(ii) Sequencing and assembly. Genomic DNA was paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) with a 350-bp insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 million reads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 (19) using the default settings. Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to find the one that gave the highest N50 score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k-mer size 86 gave the best results for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses.Phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of the newly identified strains was assessed by extracting the full-length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) from each of the genomes using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters (64), and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML (65) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap confidence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 (66). The effector clustering was done on only the F. oxysporum strains, using the list of 104 curated F. oxysporum effector candidate genes and the same clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al. (24). Briefly, 2.5-kb regions up- and downstream of a miniature impala (mimp) transposable element were scanned for potential open reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam et al. (24) for 59 individual isolates of F. oxysporum, and the resulting effector candidate genes were grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list represents the “effectorome” of a varied set of plant-pathogenic formae speciales of F. oxysporum. Screening for the presence of the putative 104 effectors was done using BLASTN (as described above). A binary data matrix was generated containing presence (“1”) or absence (“0”’) of each candidate in each genome. This table was used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix and average linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the “heatmap3” package in R. The sequences of the 10 phylogenetically informative loci used to compare ISS-F3/F4 were extracted from the genomes using the sequences of these genes in the reference genome of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287. The sequences were kindly provided by Li-Jun Ma from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The loci and chromosomal locations from the reference genome are as follows: chromosome 1, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC2 and RPB1; chromosome 4, minichromosome maintenance protein 3 and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1; chromosome 5, two hypothetical proteins, FOXG 1751.3 and 2073.3; chromosome 7, DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2; chromosome 8, hypothetical protein FOXG 3560.3; and chromosome 9, clathrin heavy chain and DNA polymerase gamma (28).k-mer analysis for strain identification. The KMC2 k-mer counter (29) tool was used to generate 50-bp-long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/) (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material). The KMC2 program was also used to determine which of the k-mers generated from each genome were unique to that genome. A subset of the unique k-mers were chosen, based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). Using command line BLAST (version ncbi-blast-2.4.0+), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used as the query against the “database” of unique k-mer sequences. For ISS- F3 or ISS-F4 to be considered one of the 65 F. oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a specific strain had to have a perfect match against a sequence in either the F3 or F4 genome.Single nucleotide polymorphism detection and phylogenetic analysis. We applied a reference-based analysis method to determine the relatedness of F3 and F4 to the reference genome, Fo47, and to 5 other F. oxysporum isolates. The list of these strains and the reasons for including them in the analysis are presented in Table S3 in Data Set S5. These publicly available genomes were downloaded from the  sequence read archive (SRA). SNP identification was carried out using PhaME (version 1.0.2) (67), which uses Nucmer for pairwise alignment of genomes. Evolutionary analyses and phylogenetic trees were constructed as part of the PhaME pipeline. The numbers of SNPs spanning the entire genome, in coding regions, and in noncoding regions were extracted from the PhaME output using a custom Perl script and plotted in Prism (version 7). In order to detect SNPs in the coding regions, a gff annotation file of the reference genome (Fo47) was supplied as input.Gene prediction and annotation. The genes of the assembled ISS-F3/F4 genomes were predicted with the AUGUSTUS gene prediction program using default settings and trained against Fusarium graminearum (30, 68). The amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were uploaded into Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com) (69), and annotation was performed with blastp-fast against the  nonredundant database, set to the “fungi” taxonomy filter. The E value cutoff was set to <1.0E−10. Gene ontology classification and InterProScan were also performed with Blast2GO using the default settings.Identification of polyketides and secondary metabolites. Predicted proteins that were annotated as polyketide synthases were further evaluated with the polyketide synthase database (35), which consists of amino acid sequences of PKSs from 12 F. oxysporum strains and 8 other Fusarium species. A blastp search was performed with F3 and F4 sequences, and a positive match was based on >95% identity and an E value of <1E−10. Biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted with the fungal version of antiSMASH (https://fungismash.secondarymetabolites.org). The input files were the (i) assembled whole-genome nucleotide sequences and (ii) gff annotation file produced from AUGUSTUS. Default settings were used in the run. C. elegans model for Fusarium oxysporum virulence. The glp-4/sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/resources/cgc) was used in the experiments. C. elegans AU37 nematodes were synchronized for the experiment as previously described (70). Synchronized nematodes were then grown on E. coli OP50 lawns until they reached the L3-L4 stage. Then nematodes (about 300 worms) were collected and washed 3 times in 10 ml of M9 buffer (71) containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin. On the last washing, worms were incubated in 10 ml M9 buffer containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin for 1 h to clean the intestinal tube and surface of nematodes from E. coli. After cleaning, nematodes were poured on plain agar plates (1.5% agar in water) to soak the kanamycin solution into agar. At this point, synchronized fasting nematodes were ready for transferring into experimental fungal conidium suspensions. Fungal conidium suspensions were prepared by growing the fungal strains on PDA plates and incubating them at 25°C for 7 days, at which time the plate was overgrown with growth. Eight milliliters of ST solution (8.5 g NaCl, 1 ml Tween 80 in 1 liter of water) was poured onto the plates, and a cotton swab was used to scrape all the moistened fungi off the plate. The liquid suspension on the plate was then transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, spun down at 3,500 × g for 5 min, and washed 3 times with sterile PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS. To count the number of conidia in the suspension, a 1/10 dilution was prepared using ST solution and conidia were counted using a hemocytometer under the 40× objective of a light microscope. Conidial stocks were diluted in PBS to 107 conidia/ml prior to the experiment. Twenty microliters of 107-conidia/ml F. oxysporum spores were suspended in 1 ml of 30% (vol/vol) brain heart infusion broth (BHI broth; Remel, USA) prepared by dilution of BHI broth in M9 buffer. For each conidium suspension, 60 worms were transferred from plain agar plates into 1 ml of a conidium suspension and incubated for 1 h at 25°C without agitation. After incubation, the entire reaction volume of conidium suspension with worms was transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 2 ml of M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Then, worms were collected by a micropipette and transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 3 ml of M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. This procedure was repeated 3 times using 3 ml of fresh M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin in a 60-mm dish at each transfer. After final washing, 10 worms were transferred into each experimental 30-mm dish (3 dishes per one fungal strain conidium suspension) containing 2 ml of 30% BHI broth and 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Worms were incubated at 25°C without agitation, and worm death was estimated at 17, 24, 44, and 50 h after conidium exposure using an Olympus SZX16 microscope (×5 magnification) with a camera (Olympus DP30BW) for imaging.Data availability.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.Results The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.Conclusions The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (10.1186/s40168-019-0666-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: International Space Station, Microbiome, 16S rRNA, ITS, Environmental surface, Built microbiome, Propidium monoazide, Microbial diversity",
    "introduction": "Introduction The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human space platform in low Earth orbit (~ 400 km above Earth’s surface) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, subjected to microgravity, radiation, elevated carbon dioxide, and the recirculation of air through HEPA filters and is considered an “extreme environment” [1, 2]. Microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the ISS may have existed since the inception of the ISS while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive. Since the beginning of the ISS, routine microbial monitoring of surfaces, air, and water has occurred using culture-based techniques as per the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) operations and maintenance requirement procedures [3]. However, culture-based analysis limits our understanding of the diversity of microbes that grow and thrive on the ISS because only a small fraction of organisms in a given environment can be cultured under standard laboratory conditions [4]. Molecular methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted amplicon sequencing, which can identify and quantify both culturable and unculturable organisms provide a more thorough assessment of what is actually present and in what amounts [5]. However, while it has been recently shown as a proof of concept that PCR [6] and amplicon sequencing can be performed on the ISS [7, 8], microbial monitoring of the ISS with molecular-based methods is not routinely used because of the lack of simple, compact, and reliable sample processing instruments onboard the ISS. Once such devices are available, rapid, real-time microbial detection, functional analysis are possible for the long duration missions, but baseline information about the ISS environmental microbiome is still needed. The importance of cataloging the ISS microbiome, which consists of both culturable and unculturable microbes, parallels the surge in research into the “built microbiome” here on Earth. Emerging studies on the microbiome of homes [9–11], offices, classrooms, museums [12, 13], and hospitals [5, 14, 15] have revealed an assemblage of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa unique to that indoor environment that are influenced by a variety of factors such as building design, ventilation, humidity, air pressure and flow, occupant numbers, or activities performed [16, 17]. Specific microbes in these indoor spaces have been shown to impact human health by influencing our susceptibility to allergies, infectious diseases, or sick building syndrome [18]. The influence of the indoor microbiome on human health becomes more important for astronauts during flights due to altered immunity associated with space flight [19, 20] and the lack of sophisticated medical interventions that are available on Earth. In light of an upcoming new era of human expansion in the universe, such as future space travel to Mars, the microbiome of the closed space environment needs to be examined thoroughly to identify the types of microorganisms that can accumulate in this unique environment, how long they persist and survive, and their impact on human health and spacecraft infrastructure. For this reason, the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended that NASA establish a coordinated, large-scale Microbial Observatory program within the ISS platform [21]. As part of this NASA initiative, the microbial communities on ISS surfaces from eight defined locations over three flight missions, spanning 14 months, were characterized using culture-based techniques, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps [22]. Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate into cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) [22, 23]. It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells [2, 24–26]. This comprehensive analysis of the ISS microbiome was used to assess how microbial communities change over time (temporal distribution) and throughout the ISS (spatial distribution). In addition, the ISS environmental microbiome data were compared with other Earth built environmental microbiome data such as the Earth Microbiome Project [27], Hospital ([28], Qiita study 10,172), and Office microbiome ([28], Qiita study 10,423). The implementation of novel molecular techniques to monitor intact microbial populations in this unique environment opens a possibility for broadening the current surveillance practices to maintain the health of the crew and to promote advances in deep space human habitation in the future.",

    "discussion": "Discussion The ISS environmental microbiome was characterized from eight locations throughout the ISS during three flight sampling events over a period of 14 months. This allowed the examination of temporal and spatial distribution of microbial populations on the ISS. This is the first study to utilize culture, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the US segment and revealed a diverse intact/viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations. Several studies have been carried out to measure microbiological cleanliness of the ISS environment using cultivation-based approaches since the inception of this closed system [35]. Recently, several ISS surfaces in the US nodes [36] and Japanese Kibo module [37] were swabbed and targeted amplicon sequencing carried out. However, these studies did not measure the intact/viable microbiome which therefore could not be compared to culture counts nor provide an assessment for crew risk. Previous reports on the ISS intact/viable microbiomes on the ISS were only examined from air filters and debris collected via vacuum cleaner bag [2]. The ISS is a unique environment and one question that is of interest to many is how this intact/viable microbiome compares to other closed, regulated environments (Additional file 1: Figure S9 and Fig. 7). The ISS environmental microbiome resembles that of animal skin surfaces rather more than the soil microbiome. This might be due to the fact that cargo sent to the space station was cleaned thoroughly, and hence soil-associated microorganisms were not present. The predominant organisms on ISS surfaces consisted of those that are associated with humans, with some considered opportunistic pathogens on Earth. As to whether they could cause disease in astronauts on the ISS is unknown, as it would depend on the health status of each individual and how these organisms function while in the space environment. Regardless, the detection of possible disease-causing organisms highlights the importance of further genomic and transcriptomic studies to examine how these ISS microbes function in space and how they may impact astronauts’ health. Correlating viable but opportunistic pathogens with crew member health is likely to raise too many questions about access to the crew microbiome data which is not yet publicly available, and about statistical power: because the ISS has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. From the time the ISS was built in 1998, as of Aug 3, 2017, 222 astronauts visited the ISS, and microbial signatures left behind by previous astronauts might interfere with the predictions. Consequently, the present ISS environmental microbial metrics could not be linked to any particular crew member. Since there were no differences in community composition and richness between PMA- and non-PMA treated samples, it suggests that the DNA analyzed from these possible opportunistic pathogens residing on the ISS environmental surfaces are indeed intact/viable and not dead organisms. Noteworthy, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured with the culture media used during this study. This percentage is high when compared to spacecraft assembly cleanrooms on Earth where only 1 to 10% of intact/viable microorganisms can be cultured [38]. The possible explanation is that the ISS is not deprived of nutrients like spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and while this is a hermetically sealed environment, it is exposed to microbes from astronauts (maximum six astronauts at a given time) and cargo (delivered ~ 4–6 times per year). Furthermore, no relationship was found between microbial load and sample processing time (F1: 7 days, F2: 9 days, and F3: 6 days). Many of the organisms detected on the ISS are known to form biofilms that belong to both bacterial (Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Corynebacterium, and Klebsiella) [39] and fungal (Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhodotorula) [40] genera. This could pose problems for astronauts if they do become infected as biofilms are known to promote resistance to antibiotics [41]. Also, biofilm formation on the ISS could decrease infrastructure stability by causing mechanical blockages, reducing heat transfer efficiency, and inducing microbial influenced corrosion [42]. Some of the microorganisms that were identified on the ISS that have been implicated in microbial-induced corrosion on Earth are Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Penicillium, and Aspergillus [43–46]; however, the role they play in corrosion aboard the ISS remains to be determined. Elucidating the potential ability to form biofilms and the magnitude of actual biofilm formation on ISS surfaces is important during long-term space missions to maintain structural stability of the crew vehicle when routine indoor maintenance cannot be as easily performed. As expected, culture-based analysis did not detect as many genera as that with amplicon sequencing; however, its importance should not be overlooked as species level identity of ISS microbial constituents could be obtained when isolates were available. Furthermore, isolating organisms allowed us to conduct a separate study to examine the influence of microgravity and radiation on antibiotic resistance and virulence [47] and to obtain whole genome sequences of organisms that grow in space, for future comparative genomics [29]. Similar to a previous study on ISS HEPA filters, where the novel organism, Solibacllus kalamii [48]was able to be identified only through culture analysis, this study has also allowed us to detect a recently identified novel species Enterobacter bugandensis that was associated with human disease on Earth [49, 50]. A high percentage of the cultivable population represented opportunistic pathogens such as S. aureus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, P. conspicua, Acinetobacter pittii, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and A. fumigatus. This could have potential health impacts on astronauts, as bacteria and fungi have been shown to be transferred between surfaces and humans upon contact [51]. The scope of the present study was not to determine whether these microorganisms were more virulent or resistant to antibiotics than on Earth but the whole genome sequences have been published for the isolated biosafety level 2 microorganisms [29] and comparative genomics of these ISS isolates with Earth strains is now possible for further investigation. Members of the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most predominant organisms on ISS surfaces of the US module, similar to what has been published for the Japanese module of the ISS [52], and were detected in almost every sample by both culture and amplicon sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S10). Both are human-associated organisms, with Staphylococcaceae commonly found on the skin and in the nasal passage, and Enterobacteriaceae commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract. These two taxa are also abundant in fitness centers [53], office buildings [54], and hospitals [5], suggesting that the ISS is similar to other built environments on Earth, in that its microbiome is shaped by human occupation [32]. On Earth, it has been observed that incoming intensive care unit (ICU) patients have a significantly higher risk of acquiring infections if the previous occupant was a carrier, despite terminal cleaning of the bed and the room [55–57]. Thus, habitation of the same area, regardless of whether individuals interact or not, may contribute to disease spread. Further studies assessing how long organisms survive on ISS surfaces and how readily they can be passed on from one individual to another in space can lead to the development of countermeasures to minimize the spread of infections from one astronaut to another during simultaneous or even separate flight missions. Methylobacteriaceae/Methylobacterium was also dominant across the ISS and could be cultured from several samples. This is a hardy organism that can withstand harsh conditions, such as ionizing radiation and strong cleaning detergents and has previously been found in NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [58], hospital ICUs [59], and the MARS500 habitat [60]. Moraxallaceae, another abundant organism on the ISS, also thrives in harsh conditions, being present in higher relative abundances in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms [61], areas of the home that utilize a lot of chemicals (i.e., washing machine) [62], and deep sea sediment of inactive hydrothermal vents [63]. R. mucilaginosa was the predominant fungal isolate from the culture analysis, and belongs to the Sporidiobolaceae family which was found in high relative abundances across the ISS with amplicon sequencing. This organism can survive inside dishwashers despite high temperatures and chemical exposure [64]. Numerous studies conducted on Earth have shown that the type and amount of human activity in a particular location impacts that indoor microbiome [65–67] and while there were no differences in the average microbial load (by culture and qPCR) nor community structure (amplicon sequencing), it was clear that there were variations between sampling points across different locations. Among the eight locations sampled (Table 1), location #6 (permanent multipurpose module [PMM] port 1) exhibited low concentrations of cultivable (Fig. 2), viable (Fig. 3a), and total (data not shown) microbial burden. The PMM is a specific location within the Node 1 Nadir module of ISS (Fig. 1) to store bags intact as opposed to open and place them into racks. Minimum crew activities are expected in PMM location #6 and hence microbial abundance might be minimal compared to other locations that are heavily occupied by astronauts in a day to day activities such as observing window cupola (location #1), toilet (location #2), ARED exercise platform (location #3), dining table (location #4) performing several experiments, or sleeping quarters (location #8). In a study performed by Mayer et al. [32] in an inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat, the cultivable bacterial load was in the range of 103–105 per m2 after the student crew inhabited the analog station. There were no significant changes in microbial load between the more active areas like the laboratory and other locations, while bedroom cultivable bacterial load increased toward the end of 30-day occupation. The fungal cultivable population was lower than bacterial, but it was in the range from 102 to 104 per m2 [68]. In contrast, the ISS results showed that cultivable microbial load were not uniform between locations and warrant more study. In general, temporal differences were observed within the bacterial population: F2 samples had higher microbial diversity (alpha diversity) than F1 and F3 samples; only Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from F3 samples and nine out of the ten most relatively abundant family level taxa differed over the three flights. These temporal differences may be due to the different occupants onboard the ISS during each of the flight sampling session. Earth indoor microbiome studies have shown that humans shed microbes to indoor surfaces upon contact, playing a pivotal role in shaping the indoor microbiome [17]. Similarly, a study of the inflatable Lunar/Mars analog conducted here on Earth showed differences in bacterial communities between day 0 (before human occupation) and after 30 days of habitation [32] showing the effects of human occupation on indoor microbial communities in a space-like environment. Of the nine astronauts that were present aboard the ISS from F1 to F2 (2 months apart), only three were present during both flights and none of the astronauts present during F1 or F2 were on the ISS during F3 sampling. Further studies that collect microbial information from astronauts in parallel with air and surface samples would help elucidate how much of an impact astronaut have toward the ISS microbiome. Unlike bacteria, fungal communities were stable over time with no temporal differences, and this could be due to the fact that fungal and bacterial communities follow different environmental determinants [69]. It should be noted that F3 samples were sequenced separately from the F1/F2 samples and used different but similar V4 primers (see “Materials and methods” section for more details). Due to the SpaceX-7 launch failure and the uncertainty of when F3 sampling kits would be flown to the ISS for sampling, it was not possible to sequence F3 with F1/F2. However, the samples were collected in the same manner, processed identically, and the same protocol used for DNA extraction. We do not believe that the choice of primers, nor the separate sequencing runs, have influenced the differences in temporal distribution presented in this manuscript for the following reasons: (i) Additional file 5: Table S2 shows the organisms that were statistically significantly different over time and shows the efficiency of each primer pair in detecting these organisms, which are almost identical. (ii) A metagenomics analysis was performed using the same DNA samples as for amplicon sequencing and all three flights were sequenced simultaneously and without multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. The family level barplot for this metagenomics data in Additional file 1: Figure S11 shows the same pattern distribution of taxa, as presented in Additional file 1: Figure S3 for the amplicon sequencing. (iii) Lastly, all statistical analyses were performed with ALDEx2 which estimates per-feature technical variation within each sample using Monte-Carlo instances drawn from Dirichlet distributions. ALDEx2 uses the centered log-ratio transformation that ensures that data are scale invariant and sub-compositionally coherent meaning that all samples are numerical consistent with each other, regardless of the total sequencing read capacity at the time of sequencing [70, 71]. This ensures that the statistical results are robust and are not influenced solely by the differential detection of ASVs that can occur during different sequencing runs. Many 16S rRNA and ITS sequences could not be identified via amplicon-targeted analyses, but a metagenomics approach recently conducted identified 318 bacterial and fungal species in these samples [72]. In addition, shotgun metagenome analysis carried out by Singh et al. [72] from the same samples revealed that reads associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid derivatives and cofactors, vitamins, etc. were the highest among all three flights. Similarly, computational analyses showed that the Legionella resistome, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance, and multi-drug resistant resistance efflux pump were high on all flights and all locations. The shot-gun reads associated with antimicrobial resistant genes in Flight 3 increased by twofold when compared with Flights 1 and 2 which also predicted the persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight 3 samples [72]. Collective beta-Lactam resistance derived from the metagenome sequence analysis shows that physical (OmpF, OmpC), transformational (penicillin-binding protein), and degradational (AmpC), and MDR efflux pump (OMP, RND, MPF) mechanisms were allocated by the microorganisms on the ISS [72]. Exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of intact/viable microbial populations of closed systems such as the ISS will facilitate planning of future human habitation of Moon, Mars, and beyond. Accumulation of intact/viable microbial cells in a confined environment poses a health risk to all inhabitants. This study on bacterial and fungal load and diversity across the ISS provides a comprehensive catalog of what can be found in closed space systems and can be used to develop safety measures for NASA to meet the requirements for long-term space travel or living in space. The implications of this study are not only limited to space biology but can have significant impact on cleanrooms here on Earth such as those in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.",

Copyright notice ID: 6452512 PMID: 30955503 Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.Results The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.Conclusions The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (10.1186/s40168-019-0666-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: International Space Station, Microbiome, 16S rRNA, ITS, Environmental surface, Built microbiome, Propidium monoazide, Microbial diversityIntroduction The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human space platform in low Earth orbit (~ 400 km above Earth’s surface) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, subjected to microgravity, radiation, elevated carbon dioxide, and the recirculation of air through HEPA filters and is considered an “extreme environment” [1, 2]. Microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the ISS may have existed since the inception of the ISS while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive. Since the beginning of the ISS, routine microbial monitoring of surfaces, air, and water has occurred using culture-based techniques as per the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) operations and maintenance requirement procedures [3]. However, culture-based analysis limits our understanding of the diversity of microbes that grow and thrive on the ISS because only a small fraction of organisms in a given environment can be cultured under standard laboratory conditions [4]. Molecular methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted amplicon sequencing, which can identify and quantify both culturable and unculturable organisms provide a more thorough assessment of what is actually present and in what amounts [5]. However, while it has been recently shown as a proof of concept that PCR [6] and amplicon sequencing can be performed on the ISS [7, 8], microbial monitoring of the ISS with molecular-based methods is not routinely used because of the lack of simple, compact, and reliable sample processing instruments onboard the ISS. Once such devices are available, rapid, real-time microbial detection, functional analysis are possible for the long duration missions, but baseline information about the ISS environmental microbiome is still needed. The importance of cataloging the ISS microbiome, which consists of both culturable and unculturable microbes, parallels the surge in research into the “built microbiome” here on Earth. Emerging studies on the microbiome of homes [9–11], offices, classrooms, museums [12, 13], and hospitals [5, 14, 15] have revealed an assemblage of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa unique to that indoor environment that are influenced by a variety of factors such as building design, ventilation, humidity, air pressure and flow, occupant numbers, or activities performed [16, 17]. Specific microbes in these indoor spaces have been shown to impact human health by influencing our susceptibility to allergies, infectious diseases, or sick building syndrome [18]. The influence of the indoor microbiome on human health becomes more important for astronauts during flights due to altered immunity associated with space flight [19, 20] and the lack of sophisticated medical interventions that are available on Earth. In light of an upcoming new era of human expansion in the universe, such as future space travel to Mars, the microbiome of the closed space environment needs to be examined thoroughly to identify the types of microorganisms that can accumulate in this unique environment, how long they persist and survive, and their impact on human health and spacecraft infrastructure. For this reason, the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended that NASA establish a coordinated, large-scale Microbial Observatory program within the ISS platform [21]. As part of this NASA initiative, the microbial communities on ISS surfaces from eight defined locations over three flight missions, spanning 14 months, were characterized using culture-based techniques, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps [22]. Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate into cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) [22, 23]. It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells [2, 24–26]. This comprehensive analysis of the ISS microbiome was used to assess how microbial communities change over time (temporal distribution) and throughout the ISS (spatial distribution). In addition, the ISS environmental microbiome data were compared with other Earth built environmental microbiome data such as the Earth Microbiome Project [27], Hospital ([28], Qiita study 10,172), and Office microbiome ([28], Qiita study 10,423). The implementation of novel molecular techniques to monitor intact microbial populations in this unique environment opens a possibility for broadening the current surveillance practices to maintain the health of the crew and to promote advances in deep space human habitation in the future.Results Twenty-four surface wipes were collected from eight locations across the ISS during three flight missions over the course of 14 months. In addition to these 24 wipes, wipes that were taken out of the kits and exposed to the ISS environment, but not used for sampling, were designated as controls and processed in parallel with the sample wipes. A summary of the sampled locations and the associated metadata is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Fig. 1.

Virts T. Virts J.Williams Open in a new tab Nodes are US modules that connect the elements of the ISS Node 1, called Unity, was the first US-built element that was launched and connects the US and Russian Segments. Node 1 has 6 ports that provide berthing connections to other modules, ISS infrastructure, and visiting cargo. The module has 4 racks. Some of which are used for stowage to return the cargo back to Earth (ISS_5). Additionally, the dining table (ISS_4) is also located in Node 1 Node 2, called Harmony, connects the US, European, and Japanese laboratories. The module provides docking and berthing ports for Japanese and US vehicles. Node 2 provides crew quarters (ISS_8) for 4 crew members as well as vital functional resources for the operation of the connected elements Node 3, called Tranquility, is attached to the port side of Node 1 and provides accommodation for life support and exercise equipment. The cupola (ISS_1) is berthed on its nadir (Earth facing) port and provides through multiple windows observation of operations outside the ISS such as robotic activities, the approach of visiting vehicles, and extravehicular activities. Additionally, Node 3 accommodates critical equipment, air revitalization, oxygen, carbon dioxide removal, water recovery system, the waste and hygienic compartment (bathroom; ISS_2), and exercising equipment such as a treadmill (ARED) and a weight-lifting device (ISS_3) The US laboratory module, called Destiny, is the primary research facility for US payloads. The module hosts 24 equipment racks for accommodation and control of ISS systems and scientific research in physical and biological sciences (ISS_7) The Permanent Multipurpose Module, called PMM, hosts up to 16 stowage racks (ISS_6) containing equipment, experiments, and supplies, and its additional storage space for bags in the aft endcone Cultivable microbial population The cultivable microbial load from all flight samples and their distribution patterns at various locations are depicted. The average number of bacteria cultured on blood agar (BA) and R2A plates was similar between F1 and F2 but higher at F3 (though this trend was not statistically significant) (Fig. 2a). There were no statistically significant differences in the average bacterial load across the eight locations (Fig. 2b); however, the locations that exceeded 1010 CFU/m2 during at least one flight sampling event were L1 (port panel next to cupola), L5 (overhead 4), L7 (lab 3 overhead), and L8 (crew quarters), with the lowest counts (less than 104 CFU/m2 in at least one sampling event) found at L3 (AREM) and L6 (PMM). Overall, the number of bacteria (combination of R2A and BA growth) isolated from the ISS from all 24 samples ranged from 6.7 × 103 to 7.8 × 1010 CFU/m2. Fig. 2.

The colored boxes represent the different types of plates the samples were cultured on: Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) or blood agar (BA) plates to isolate bacteria and potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates to isolate fungi. The height of the colored box indicates the average CFU/m2 for samples in that group. F1 = flight 1 sampling session, F2 = flight 2 sampling session, and F3 = flight 3 sampling session. NB: There was no growth on R2A plates from location 6 sampled during F1 and F2 and from location 3 sampled during F2. b Bar graph representing the CFU/m2 based on location. The number of bacteria isolated on R2A and BA plates were averaged to obtain a number for “Bacteria.” The bars represent the average CFU/m2 at each location with the capped lines showing the lowest and highest value in that group (N = 3). The differences in averages observed in (a, b) were not statistically significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test P > 0.05). The average number of bacteria and fungi found at each location were similarFungi were also cultured from the ISS, ranging from 1.1 × 105 to 3.1 × 108 CFU/m2. While, there were no statistically significant differences in fungal load over time, the highest average was found during F1 and the lowest at F2 (Fig. 2a). Similar to what was observed with bacterial counts, no differences in fungal counts were evident across the eight locations (Fig. 2b). When compared to bacteria, the fungal population was lower by 2 to 3 logs at all locations except at L6 where fungal load was 100-fold more than bacterial load (Fig. 2b). Due to the high variability between samples, there were no statistically significant differences overall in the average cultivable counts of bacteria (BA and R2A plates) from all 24 samples compared to the average fungal counts measured from the same 24 samples (P > 0.05). Of the total bacterial and fungal isolates that grew, 133 bacterial isolates and 81 fungal isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria; and ITS region for fungi). The bacterial isolates belonged to three phyla: Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. At the genus level, the most predominant genera were Staphylococcus (26% of total isolates identified), Pantoea (23%), and Bacillus (11%) and at the species level, Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and both Pantoea conspicua (9%) and Pantoea gaviniae (9%) (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). Although bacterial counts were similar across all flights (Fig. 2), only members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from F3 samples (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). S. aureus isolates were tested with the Vitek 2 system (BioMerieux, France) and found to be methicillin-sensitive; however, these isolates were resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, gentamycin, and tobramycin [28]. The whole genomes of 20 biosafety level 2 strains, isolated from these samples, have been sequenced and are publicly available [29]. The fungal population was dominated by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa belonging to the family Sporidiobolaceae (41% of the 81 examined fungal isolates) and Penicillium chrysogenum (15% of 81 fungal isolates) (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). The whole genome of one Aspergillus fumigatus strain (isolated from F1, L1 [cupola] sample) was sequenced, its virulence characterized, and this information reported elsewhere [30, 31].qPCR-based microbial population The 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region were targeted in PMA-qPCR to measure intact/viable bacterial and fungal burden, respectively. The changes were not significantly different (P > 0.05), although the average number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies trended toward increase from F1 to F3. On the other hand, the ITS region amplicons decreased over time with F3 being statistically significantly lower than F1 (Fig. 3a). While the average bacterial (Fig. 3b) and fungal (Fig. 3c) load fluctuated across locations, there were no statistically significant differences in microbial load among different locations. Overall, bacterial loads appeared to be highest at L4 and L5 and lowest at L6, with fungal loads appearing to be highest at L1, L4, L5, and L7 and lowest at L2. The average number of bacteria present on the ISS during this study was 3.1 × 109 16S rRNA gene copy number/m2 and 7.1 × 108 ITS copy number/m2 for fungi. A comparison between CFU and gene copy number revealed that on average, 46% of total intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured, while the remainder were viable but yet to be cultured (Additional file 1: Figure S1C). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Intact cell membrane/viable bacterial and fungal population aboard the ISS as estimated by PMA-qPCR. a Scatter plot comparing the 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi) copy numbers of PMA treated samples collected during flights 1, 2, and 3. Each column represents a single flight and each symbol in a column (labeled with a number) represents one of the eight locations sampled during that flight. The horizontal line in each column represents the average gene copy number/m2 for each Flight. b Scatter plot comparing 16S rRNA gene and c ITS region (fungi) copy numbers across locations. Each column “L” followed by a number represents a location and each dot in a column represents the flight it was sampled from. The horizontal line in each column represents the average copy number/m2 at that location. NB: The 16S rRNA gene copy number was not adjusted to the average number per bacterial genome. Control samples were measured and found to be at the level of 102 16S rRNA gene copies per μL. Even when the initial template volume was increased to 10 μL, the expected 20-fold increase in the gene copy numbers was not observed. In panel a, F1-ITS was statistically significantly higher than F3-ITS (P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in panel b (P > 0.05). The statistical test was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc testqPCR was also performed on samples that were not treated with PMA to assess the overall microbial load, which includes intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells. The average 16S rRNA copy number was 7.1 × 109/m2 and the average ITS copy number was 5.1 × 108 m2 in these non-PMA-treated samples (Additional file 1: Figure S1D). When the 16S rRNA gene copies were summed up for all locations and all flights, no significant difference was observed with and without PMA (Additional file 1: Figure S1D). This calculation may be affected by the artificial inflation of high copy numbers in samples treated with and without PMA. For example, the highest copy numbers of a sample with 1010 copies per m2 (for example, Flight 1, Location #2) might mask the samples with 107 copies per m2 (for example Flight 1, Location #6). The difference in microbial populations between PMA and non-PMA-treated samples were substantial when the data from individual locations were considered. In general, ~ 0.68% (example: Flight 2; Location #3) to ~ 92.8% (example: Flight 3; Location #5) of the microbial load was present in the PMA-treated sample and therefore considered “viable” (Additional file 1: Figure S1E). Similar reduction in microbial abundance in PMA-treated samples when compared to untreated samples was reported in NASA spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) clean room floors (4 to 21%; [24]), Lunar Mars Analog Habitat floors (10 to 40%; [32]), and HEPA filter particulates of ISS and SAF (1.7 to 66.8%; [2]).Bacteriome analysis After processing the raw data from 48 samples (24 PMA samples and 24 non-PMA-treated samples) and various wipe and reagent controls, amplicon sequence variants (“ASVs”) (a higher resolution analogue of the ubiquitous “OTU”) [33] that had a cumulative sum of more reads in the controls than the cumulative sum of all the samples, were removed from the dataset. Next, ASVs that were found to be statistically significantly higher (ALDEx2 test, P < 0.05) in the control group than in the sample group were further removed from the dataset. Additional file 2: Dataset 1A summarizes the ASV read count in each sample and in each control after the above quality control measures were implemented. Next, the program “SourceTracker” was used to predict what percent of reads in the samples were unique to the samples and what percent were from “contaminating” ASVs (i.e., those were represented in a Dirichlet model trained from the control samples). Additional file 1: Figure S2B summarizes the results from SourceTracker and shows that contamination was negligible in 32 out of 48 samples and for the remaining 16 samples; the contamination was less than 6% of the total sequences. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) plot verifies that the bacterial communities of the controls were indeed different than those of the samples (Fig. 4). The ASV table used for downstream analysis, after the above quality control measures were implemented and after verification that the samples represented a unique microbiome, different than that of the controls, is presented in Additional file 2: Dataset S1A.

Microbial populations (16S rRNA gene copies) from eight locations over the span of 14 months were calculated from PMA-treated samples (viable/intact bacteria) and non-PMA treated samples (dead/compromised bacteria). Figure 5 shows the proportion of different taxa, summarized to the family level, found in these samples and the variations in their viable populations. In both the PMA- and non-PMA-treated groups, Enterobacteriaceae dominated and made up a little over 50% of the sequences detected in all 24 samples combined, followed by Methylobacteriaceae (~ 13%) and Staphylococcaceae (~ 10%). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Pie chart showing the relative abundances of taxa identified on the ISS. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on 24 wipes, taken from 8 locations throughout the ISS (see Fig. 1) during 3 flight sampling sessions, spanning 14 months. For each sample, half was treated with PMA (N = 24) to detect intact/viable bacteria, while the remaining half was left untreated (N = 24) to determine the total bacterial community (both dead cells/cells with a compromised cell membrane and intact/viable). The sequences obtained from both the untreated and PMA-treated samples were summarized to the family level and the relative abundances depicted in this pie chart. In total, 68 different family level taxa were detected but only the most relatively abundant taxa are listed in the legend. A full list of organisms detected can be found in Dataset S1. Those sequences that could not be resolved to the family level are prefixed with either “o” for Order or “c” for ClassOf interest was whether the ISS environmental microbiome, and especially the most abundant taxa, changed over time and across locations. The taxa present in the non-PMA-treated (Fig. 6a) and PMA-treated (Fig. 6b) groups showed the same temporal progression: The relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae was highest during F3 and lowest during F2, whereas Methylobacteriaceae was the lowest during F3 and highest during F1. Paenibacillaceae and members of the class Bacilli and order Bacillales had high relative abundances during F2, and almost negligible amounts during F1 and F3. Interestingly, F1 and F2 had higher relative abundances of sequences that could not be identified, compared to F3. Statistical analysis using ALDEx2 confirmed that the relative abundances over the three flight sessions were different for all taxa shown, expect for Paenibacillaceae in the non-PMA group (Fig. 6a) and Paenibacillacae, Staphylococcaceae, and Sphingomondales in the PMA-treated group (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Temporal and spatial distribution of the ISS microbiome over 14 months and across eight locations. Boxplots show the temporal (a, b) and spatial (c, d) distribution of the most relatively abundant family level taxa (as presented in Fig. 4). The box in each graph signifies the 75% (upper) and 25% (lower) quartiles and thus shows the percent abundances for 50% of the samples (N = 8). The black line inside the box represents the median. The bottom whisker represents the lowest datum still within the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) of the lower quartile, with the top whisker representing the highest datum still within the 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Open circles are outliers. “o” and “c” represent sequences that could not be taxonomically assigned past the order or class level respectively. “F” indicates Flight and “L” indicates Location. a Temporal distribution over time in untreated samples.

Taxa showed statistically significant changes over time except Paenibacillacae, Staphylococcaceae, and o_Sphingomondales (denoted by *). Spatial distribution in untreated samples (c) and in PMA treated samples (d). There were no statistically significant differences in these taxa across the eight locations. Significance was measured using ALDEx2 and based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P value of the Kruskal-Wallis test (significance threshold, P < 0.05). Those sequences that could not be resolved to the family level are prefixed with either “o” for Order or “c” for ClassUnlike the differences observed over time, no statistically significant differences in relative abundances were observed between the eight locations (Fig. 6c, d); however, some interesting trends are worth noting: Enterobacteriaceae was well represented at each location, with the highest relative abundance observed at L1, L5, and L6. Methylobacteriaceae was also highly represented across locations except for L2, L5, and L6. The barplot in (Additional file 1: Figure S3) provides a more detailed representation of the relative abundances of family level taxa in each sample. Upon visual inspection, it appears that bacterial diversity within a sample was the lowest during Flight 3, which consisted predominately of Enterobacteriaceae, and was the highest during F2. This observation was statistically confirmed (P < 0.05) by calculating (i) Shannon’s diversity index, which measures both taxa presence and relative abundance and (ii) taxon richness, which reports the number of unique taxa in a sample (Additional file 1: Figure S4A and B). Noteworthy, both alpha diversity (measured with Shannon’s diversity index and taxa richness) and beta diversity (measured with ALDEx2) showed no differences between PMA and non-PMA treated samples across all three flights, suggesting that the DNA recovered from the ISS were from intact/viable organisms. When the ASVs were summarized to the genus level, 121 taxa were detected, 77 of which could be assigned to known genera (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Of those 77 genera, 68% of them are known constituents of the human microbiome and the remaining 32% are found in environments such as soil and water.Mycobiome analysis Amplicon sequencing of the fungal ITS region was performed on samples collected during F1 and F2. Since F3 exhibited low abundance of cultivable fungal counts, it was not possible to generate amplicons for further sequencing. Similar to what was done with bacterial sequences, OTU counts that were higher across controls compared to samples were removed from the dataset. For one OTU, even though the cumulative read count of the controls was 33 times lower than the samples, since the count was 300,000, it was removed from the dataset. Additional file 2: Dataset S1B shows the fungal OTU table that was used for analyses after OTUs associated with controls were removed. The SourceTracker results for the mycobiome are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S6A and the total OTU read count for the sample and control wipes is presented in Additional file 1: Figure S6B. The fungal population consisted of four genera plus members belonging to one phylum, two classes, and four families, in addition to sequences that could not be classified (Additional file 1: Figure S7). The temporal and spatial distribution of the five most relatively abundant taxa are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S8. With the exception of Sporidiobolaceae which was higher in F2 compared to F1, there were no other statistically significant differences in fungal taxa between flights. Unlike bacteria, fungal diversity within samples (i.e., alpha diversity) did not change between Flight 1 and 2 (Additional file 1: Figure S4C and D). Similar to what was observed with bacteria, alpha and beta diversity were similar between the PMA- and non-PMA treated samples across these two flights.Comparison of ISS environmental microbiome with Earth microbiome Publicly available sequences of PMA-treated samples collected from two JPL clean rooms, ISS dust, ISS HEPA filters, and surface samples from an inflated Lunar Mars analogue habitat (ILMAH) were compared. As is clear from the PCoA plot shown in Additional file 1: Figure S9, the ISS surface microbiome is a unique microbiome, differing from the ISS-dust, ISS-HEPA, JPL clean rooms, and Lunar/Mars-like human-occupied habitats. In addition, PMA-untreated microbial diversity associated with ISS environments was compared to results obtained from the Earth Microbiome Project, hospital environment, and office spaces. The ISS samples grouped with the built environment data, as shown in Fig. 7. This relationship also suggests that, as expected, the environmental locations sampled on the ISS harbored microbes more similar to those on animal surfaces (e.g., skin) than to environmental soil samples. Similar pattern was seen with built environmental samples from Earth. Thus, the ISS samples resembled other Earth built environment samples, and the differences among flights (including differences in DNA extraction and PCR amplification) were relatively small compared to the differences among different sample types. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of ISS environmental microbiome with microbiomes of Earth. Principal coordinates analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances from the Earth Microbiome Project [96], the Hospital Microbiome Project ([5], Qiita study 10,172), and the Office Succession Study [105] depicting a PC1 vs. PC2 and b PC1 vs. PC3. The Hospital Microbiome Project and Office Succession Study are composed predominantly built environment samples (e.g., walls, floors, etc.). All three ISS flight sample sets group with the built environment samples. The primary separation along PC1 is environmental or plant associated samples vs. animal surface, secretion, or built environment. The primary separation along PC3 is whether a sample is associated with the animal gutUsing the unrarefied data, the unique sub-operational taxonomic units (sOTUs) present in the ISS data were also compared with other built environment datasets collected on various locations of Earth to determine whether any sOTUs appear to be unique to the ISS. For this analysis, only Flight 3 data were included since all the other built environment datasets used the same primer set. The sOTUs observed in the ISS controls were removed. There were four sOTUs that appear to be unique relative to all the built environment datasets analyzed (see Additional file 4: Table S4), although they accounted for a very small total amount of the sequence mass (~ 0.0005% of the reads). These unique sOTUs exhibited high identity to Bacteroides sp., Gottschalkia acidurici, Paenibacillus thailandensis, and Thermus thermophilus based on BLAST to nr/nt [34]. One single sOTU belonging to T. thermophilus was unique in Flight 3 samples and was not observed in the Earth Microbiome Project, nor in other built environment datasets on Earth.Discussion The ISS environmental microbiome was characterized from eight locations throughout the ISS during three flight sampling events over a period of 14 months. This allowed the examination of temporal and spatial distribution of microbial populations on the ISS. This is the first study to utilize culture, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the US segment and revealed a diverse intact/viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations. Several studies have been carried out to measure microbiological cleanliness of the ISS environment using cultivation-based approaches since the inception of this closed system [35]. Recently, several ISS surfaces in the US nodes [36] and Japanese Kibo module [37] were swabbed and targeted amplicon sequencing carried out. However, these studies did not measure the intact/viable microbiome which therefore could not be compared to culture counts nor provide an assessment for crew risk. Previous reports on the ISS intact/viable microbiomes on the ISS were only examined from air filters and debris collected via vacuum cleaner bag [2]. The ISS is a unique environment and one question that is of interest to many is how this intact/viable microbiome compares to other closed, regulated environments (Additional file 1: Figure S9 and Fig. 7). The ISS environmental microbiome resembles that of animal skin surfaces rather more than the soil microbiome. This might be due to the fact that cargo sent to the space station was cleaned thoroughly, and hence soil-associated microorganisms were not present. The predominant organisms on ISS surfaces consisted of those that are associated with humans, with some considered opportunistic pathogens on Earth. As to whether they could cause disease in astronauts on the ISS is unknown, as it would depend on the health status of each individual and how these organisms function while in the space environment. Regardless, the detection of possible disease-causing organisms highlights the importance of further genomic and transcriptomic studies to examine how these ISS microbes function in space and how they may impact astronauts’ health. Correlating viable but opportunistic pathogens with crew member health is likely to raise too many questions about access to the crew microbiome data which is not yet publicly available, and about statistical power: because the ISS has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. From the time the ISS was built in 1998, as of Aug 3, 2017, 222 astronauts visited the ISS, and microbial signatures left behind by previous astronauts might interfere with the predictions. Consequently, the present ISS environmental microbial metrics could not be linked to any particular crew member. Since there were no differences in community composition and richness between PMA- and non-PMA treated samples, it suggests that the DNA analyzed from these possible opportunistic pathogens residing on the ISS environmental surfaces are indeed intact/viable and not dead organisms. Noteworthy, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured with the culture media used during this study. This percentage is high when compared to spacecraft assembly cleanrooms on Earth where only 1 to 10% of intact/viable microorganisms can be cultured [38]. The possible explanation is that the ISS is not deprived of nutrients like spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and while this is a hermetically sealed environment, it is exposed to microbes from astronauts (maximum six astronauts at a given time) and cargo (delivered ~ 4–6 times per year). Furthermore, no relationship was found between microbial load and sample processing time (F1: 7 days, F2: 9 days, and F3: 6 days). Many of the organisms detected on the ISS are known to form biofilms that belong to both bacterial (Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Corynebacterium, and Klebsiella) [39] and fungal (Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhodotorula) [40] genera. This could pose problems for astronauts if they do become infected as biofilms are known to promote resistance to antibiotics [41]. Also, biofilm formation on the ISS could decrease infrastructure stability by causing mechanical blockages, reducing heat transfer efficiency, and inducing microbial influenced corrosion [42]. Some of the microorganisms that were identified on the ISS that have been implicated in microbial-induced corrosion on Earth are Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Penicillium, and Aspergillus [43–46]; however, the role they play in corrosion aboard the ISS remains to be determined. Elucidating the potential ability to form biofilms and the magnitude of actual biofilm formation on ISS surfaces is important during long-term space missions to maintain structural stability of the crew vehicle when routine indoor maintenance cannot be as easily performed. As expected, culture-based analysis did not detect as many genera as that with amplicon sequencing; however, its importance should not be overlooked as species level identity of ISS microbial constituents could be obtained when isolates were available. Furthermore, isolating organisms allowed us to conduct a separate study to examine the influence of microgravity and radiation on antibiotic resistance and virulence [47] and to obtain whole genome sequences of organisms that grow in space, for future comparative genomics [29]. Similar to a previous study on ISS HEPA filters, where the novel organism, Solibacllus kalamii [48]was able to be identified only through culture analysis, this study has also allowed us to detect a recently identified novel species Enterobacter bugandensis that was associated with human disease on Earth [49, 50]. A high percentage of the cultivable population represented opportunistic pathogens such as S. aureus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, P. conspicua, Acinetobacter pittii, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and A. fumigatus. This could have potential health impacts on astronauts, as bacteria and fungi have been shown to be transferred between surfaces and humans upon contact [51]. The scope of the present study was not to determine whether these microorganisms were more virulent or resistant to antibiotics than on Earth but the whole genome sequences have been published for the isolated biosafety level 2 microorganisms [29] and comparative genomics of these ISS isolates with Earth strains is now possible for further investigation. Members of the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most predominant organisms on ISS surfaces of the US module, similar to what has been published for the Japanese module of the ISS [52], and were detected in almost every sample by both culture and amplicon sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S10). Both are human-associated organisms, with Staphylococcaceae commonly found on the skin and in the nasal passage, and Enterobacteriaceae commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract. These two taxa are also abundant in fitness centers [53], office buildings [54], and hospitals [5], suggesting that the ISS is similar to other built environments on Earth, in that its microbiome is shaped by human occupation [32]. On Earth, it has been observed that incoming intensive care unit (ICU) patients have a significantly higher risk of acquiring infections if the previous occupant was a carrier, despite terminal cleaning of the bed and the room [55–57]. Thus, habitation of the same area, regardless of whether individuals interact or not, may contribute to disease spread. Further studies assessing how long organisms survive on ISS surfaces and how readily they can be passed on from one individual to another in space can lead to the development of countermeasures to minimize the spread of infections from one astronaut to another during simultaneous or even separate flight missions. Methylobacteriaceae/Methylobacterium was also dominant across the ISS and could be cultured from several samples. This is a hardy organism that can withstand harsh conditions, such as ionizing radiation and strong cleaning detergents and has previously been found in NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [58], hospital ICUs [59], and the MARS500 habitat [60]. Moraxallaceae, another abundant organism on the ISS, also thrives in harsh conditions, being present in higher relative abundances in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms [61], areas of the home that utilize a lot of chemicals (i.e., washing machine) [62], and deep sea sediment of inactive hydrothermal vents [63]. R. mucilaginosa was the predominant fungal isolate from the culture analysis, and belongs to the Sporidiobolaceae family which was found in high relative abundances across the ISS with amplicon sequencing. This organism can survive inside dishwashers despite high temperatures and chemical exposure [64]. Numerous studies conducted on Earth have shown that the type and amount of human activity in a particular location impacts that indoor microbiome [65–67] and while there were no differences in the average microbial load (by culture and qPCR) nor community structure (amplicon sequencing), it was clear that there were variations between sampling points across different locations. Among the eight locations sampled (Table 1), location #6 (permanent multipurpose module [PMM] port 1) exhibited low concentrations of cultivable (Fig. 2), viable (Fig. 3a), and total (data not shown) microbial burden. The PMM is a specific location within the Node 1 Nadir module of ISS (Fig. 1) to store bags intact as opposed to open and place them into racks. Minimum crew activities are expected in PMM location #6 and hence microbial abundance might be minimal compared to other locations that are heavily occupied by astronauts in a day to day activities such as observing window cupola (location #1), toilet (location #2), ARED exercise platform (location #3), dining table (location #4) performing several experiments, or sleeping quarters (location #8). In a study performed by Mayer et al. [32] in an inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat, the cultivable bacterial load was in the range of 103–105 per m2 after the student crew inhabited the analog station. There were no significant changes in microbial load between the more active areas like the laboratory and other locations, while bedroom cultivable bacterial load increased toward the end of 30-day occupation. The fungal cultivable population was lower than bacterial, but it was in the range from 102 to 104 per m2 [68]. In contrast, the ISS results showed that cultivable microbial load were not uniform between locations and warrant more study. In general, temporal differences were observed within the bacterial population: F2 samples had higher microbial diversity (alpha diversity) than F1 and F3 samples; only Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from F3 samples and nine out of the ten most relatively abundant family level taxa differed over the three flights. These temporal differences may be due to the different occupants onboard the ISS during each of the flight sampling session. Earth indoor microbiome studies have shown that humans shed microbes to indoor surfaces upon contact, playing a pivotal role in shaping the indoor microbiome [17]. Similarly, a study of the inflatable Lunar/Mars analog conducted here on Earth showed differences in bacterial communities between day 0 (before human occupation) and after 30 days of habitation [32] showing the effects of human occupation on indoor microbial communities in a space-like environment. Of the nine astronauts that were present aboard the ISS from F1 to F2 (2 months apart), only three were present during both flights and none of the astronauts present during F1 or F2 were on the ISS during F3 sampling. Further studies that collect microbial information from astronauts in parallel with air and surface samples would help elucidate how much of an impact astronaut have toward the ISS microbiome. Unlike bacteria, fungal communities were stable over time with no temporal differences, and this could be due to the fact that fungal and bacterial communities follow different environmental determinants [69]. It should be noted that F3 samples were sequenced separately from the F1/F2 samples and used different but similar V4 primers (see “Materials and methods” section for more details). Due to the SpaceX-7 launch failure and the uncertainty of when F3 sampling kits would be flown to the ISS for sampling, it was not possible to sequence F3 with F1/F2. However, the samples were collected in the same manner, processed identically, and the same protocol used for DNA extraction. We do not believe that the choice of primers, nor the separate sequencing runs, have influenced the differences in temporal distribution presented in this manuscript for the following reasons: (i) Additional file 5: Table S2 shows the organisms that were statistically significantly different over time and shows the efficiency of each primer pair in detecting these organisms, which are almost identical. (ii) A metagenomics analysis was performed using the same DNA samples as for amplicon sequencing and all three flights were sequenced simultaneously and without multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. The family level barplot for this metagenomics data in Additional file 1: Figure S11 shows the same pattern distribution of taxa, as presented in Additional file 1: Figure S3 for the amplicon sequencing. (iii) Lastly, all statistical analyses were performed with ALDEx2 which estimates per-feature technical variation within each sample using Monte-Carlo instances drawn from Dirichlet distributions. ALDEx2 uses the centered log-ratio transformation that ensures that data are scale invariant and sub-compositionally coherent meaning that all samples are numerical consistent with each other, regardless of the total sequencing read capacity at the time of sequencing [70, 71]. This ensures that the statistical results are robust and are not influenced solely by the differential detection of ASVs that can occur during different sequencing runs. Many 16S rRNA and ITS sequences could not be identified via amplicon-targeted analyses, but a metagenomics approach recently conducted identified 318 bacterial and fungal species in these samples [72]. In addition, shotgun metagenome analysis carried out by Singh et al. [72] from the same samples revealed that reads associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid derivatives and cofactors, vitamins, etc. were the highest among all three flights. Similarly, computational analyses showed that the Legionella resistome, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance, and multi-drug resistant resistance efflux pump were high on all flights and all locations. The shot-gun reads associated with antimicrobial resistant genes in Flight 3 increased by twofold when compared with Flights 1 and 2 which also predicted the persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight 3 samples [72]. Collective beta-Lactam resistance derived from the metagenome sequence analysis shows that physical (OmpF, OmpC), transformational (penicillin-binding protein), and degradational (AmpC), and MDR efflux pump (OMP, RND, MPF) mechanisms were allocated by the microorganisms on the ISS [72]. Exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of intact/viable microbial populations of closed systems such as the ISS will facilitate planning of future human habitation of Moon, Mars, and beyond. Accumulation of intact/viable microbial cells in a confined environment poses a health risk to all inhabitants. This study on bacterial and fungal load and diversity across the ISS provides a comprehensive catalog of what can be found in closed space systems and can be used to develop safety measures for NASA to meet the requirements for long-term space travel or living in space. The implications of this study are not only limited to space biology but can have significant impact on cleanrooms here on Earth such as those in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.Materials and methods Sample kit preparation and sample collection Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag [73]. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Each sampling kit was sent to the ISS onboard the SpaceX-5, -6, -8, rockets and returned to the Earth onboard the Russian vehicle (Soyuz TM-14) and Dragon capsule (SpX-6 or -8). Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the polyester wipes described above (see Fig. 1 for a summary of the sampling locations). The metadata associated with the samples and collections is summarized in Additional file 6: Table S3. The study requirements stated that there should be no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. When the cleaning occurred during the weekends, it was done at the crew’s discretion without suggestions about the specific locations, therefore following the typical routine of activities on the ISS. The disinfectant wipes that are used in the ISS contain octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%). During each flight, one astronaut performed all the sampling and used the wipes to sample one square meter. A new pair of individually packed sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190) were used before sampling the next location. The crew was instructed to collect samples from the same surfaces during all three sampling sessions. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the Zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. If field controls (wipes that were exposed to the ISS environment but not used in active sampling) showed any signs of microbial growth, then negative controls would be assayed for cultivable counts to check sterility of the wipes used for sampling. However, none of the field controls showed any CFUs for all three flights. The samples were stored at room temperature in orbit. After sample collection, samples were returned to Earth after 7 days for Flight 1, 9 days for Flight 2, and 6 days for Flight 3. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4 °C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt.Sample processing Sample processing took place in a ISO 7 (10K class) cleanroom at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The bottle with the wipe was shaken for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO) using a 0.22 μm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat #: CC08022). Each sample was concentrated to 4 mL with PBS elution fluid (Cat #). Then, 3 mL of this concentrated sample was split into two 1.5 mL aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PMA (18.25 μL of 2 mM PMA, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μM) to assess cells that were viable or had an intact cell membrane [24], while the second aliquot was handled in a similar manner but without the addition of PMA. The PMA and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-Lite™ LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA -treated aliquots were then split into two 0.75 mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control (MC) without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with each flight sample. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μL of water and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis.Estimation and identification of cultivable microbial population The concentrated samples were diluted in PBS (up to 10−6 of each original sample) and 100 μL of each dilution was plated (in duplicate) on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A for environmental bacteria), Potato Dextrose Agar with chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL; PDA for fungi), and blood agar (BA for human commensals; Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). R2A and PDA plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7 days and BA plates at 35 °C for 2 days at which time colony forming units (CFU) were calculated. Whenever possible, a minimum of five isolates of distinct morphologies were picked from each plate, from each ISS sampling location. The isolates were then archived in semisolid R2A or PDA slants (agar media diluted 1:10) and stored at room temperature. Once a culture was confirmed to be pure, two cryobead stocks (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) were prepared for each isolate and stored at − 80 °C. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR and the targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR), or DNA was extracted with the UltraClean DNA kit (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA) or Maxwell Automated System (Promega, Madison, WI). The extracted DNA was used for PCR to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene in order to identify bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) [74, 75]. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The ITS region was amplified using the forward primer ITS1F (5′-TTG GTC ATT TAG AGG AAG TAA-3′) [76] and reverse primer Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) [77] to obtain a ~ 1.2 kb product. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplicons were inspected on a 1% agarose gel. When bands for products were visible, amplification products were treated with Antarctic phosphatase and exonuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to remove 5′- and 3′-phosphates from unused dNTPs before sequencing. The sequencing was performed by Macrogen (Rockville, MD) using 27F and 1492R primers for Bacteria, and ITS1F and Tw13 primers for Fungi. The sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e database [78] and the fungal sequences against the UNITE database [79]. The identification was based on the closest percentage similarity (> 97%) to previously identified microbial type strains.qPCR assay Following DNA extraction with the Maxwell Automated system, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), targeting the partial 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) or partial ITS region (fungi), was performed with SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) to quantify the microbial abundance. Primers targeting the partial 16S rRNA gene were 1369F (5′-CGG TGA ATA CGT TCY CGG-3′) and modified 1492R (5′-GGW TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) [80]. Primers targeting the ITS region were NS91 (5′-GTC CCT GCC CTT TGT ACA CAC-3′) and ITS51 (5′-ACC TTG TTA CGA CTT TTA CTT CCT C-3′) [81]. Each 25-μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), and 1 μL of template DNA (PMA treated and non-treated samples). Each sample was run in triplicate; the average and standard deviation were calculated based on these results. Purified DNA from a model microbial community [82] served as the positive control and DNase/RNase free molecular-grade distilled water (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the negative control in each run. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 3-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and a combined annealing and extension at 55 °C for 35 s. The number of gene copies in the samples were determined by running a standard curve, which was generated using serial dilutions (108–102) of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 16S rRNA gene as described previously [2]. The qPCR efficiency was ~ 98% for each run. The negative control values were not deducted since the values were at ~ 100 copies per 1 or 10 μL and not scalable (yielded the same results despite using 1 μL and 10 μL of DNA templates was used).Illumina sequencing - Bacteria Flight sampling 1 and 2 Bacterial diversity was assessed by analyzing the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene coding sequence. Amplification was performed with the following primer pair: forward primer, A519F (new nomenclature: S-D-Arch-0519-a-S-15), 5′-CAG CMG CCG CGG TAA-3′, and the reverse primer 802R (new nomenclature: S-D-Bact-0785-b-A-18,) 5′-TAC NVG GGT ATC TAA TCC-3′ [83]. Expected amplicon size is 283 for Bacteria as estimated for 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in the Silva SEED Reference Database [84]. Fungal diversity was assessed by analyzing the ITS1 region between 18S and 5.8S rRNA coding sequences. Amplification primers were ITS1-F_KYO2 (5′-TAG AGG AAG TAA AAG TCG TAA-3′) and ITS2_KYO2 (5′-TTY RCT RCG TTC TTC ATC-3′) [85]. Expected amplicon length distribution is 271 ± 90 bp for Ascomycota, 284 ± 42 bp for Basidiomycota, and 216 ± 94 bp for non-Dikarya species [86]. PCR synthesis of SSU-V4 and ITS1 amplicons was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 40-μL reaction mixtures were incubated under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 47 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, each reaction mixture was fractionated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, recovering all PCR products in the size range of 200 to 400 bp. The amplicons were isolated from gel slices using silica spin-columns [87], and eluted with nano-pure water. The purified amplicons were tagged with barcoded Illumina adapters using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit LT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were quantified on a TBS-380 Fluorimeter (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) using PicoGreen dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as a dsDNA-binding fluorogenic reagent. The dsDNA length distribution in individual library preps was assessed by analysis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The libraries were pooled to be present at equimolar concentrations in each mixed sample with total concentration of 10 nM. The first mixed sample contained 20 16S rRNA-V4 libraries and 17 ITS1 libraries representing the first ISS sampling session together with corresponding controls. The second mixed sample contained 21 16S rRNA-V4 libraries and 20 ITS1 libraries representing the second ISS sampling session and corresponding controls. The two sample sets were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with NextSeq 500/550 Mid-Output v2 Kit for 300 main and 6 index cycles.Flight sampling 3 DNA from these samples was amplified using 1 μL of gDNA in triplicate 25 μL reactions using Platinum Hot Start PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher cat# 13000012) and custom golay barcoded primers of the 16S V4 region, 515fB (5′-GTG YCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3′) and 806rB (5′-GGA CTA CNV GGG TWT CTA AT-3′), (expected amplicon size ~ 291 bp) as described in the http://www.earthmicrobiome.org for 94 °C 3 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C 45 s, 50 °C 60 s, 72 °C 90 s followed by 72 °C 10 min and held at 4 °C. Triplicate reactions were then pooled into a single tube and quality assessed. The amplicons were run on a 2% agarose gel and quantified using PicoGreen to access quality and relative quantity. All samples were pooled in equal volume into a single tube and then processed through the MoBio PCR cleanup kit to remove adaptors and primers. Final cleaned pools were then sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 2 × 150 bp Rapid Run.Illumina sequence processing—Bacteria (flight 1, 2, and 3) For F1 and F2 samples, the forward reads were de-multiplexed by using fastq-multx v. 1.02.772, a tool from ea-utils software package [88], with the forward amplification primers for prokaryotes as search targets. The reads were further processed to remove all remaining sequences of the amplification primers and the Illumina TruSeq adapters from their 3′-ends using consecutively fastq-mcf v. 1.04.807 program [88] for exact sequence search, and agrep (http://www.tgries.de/agrep/) and treagrep (0.8.0: https://github.com/laurikari/tre/) programs for search allowing up to three mismatches between the primers/adapters and the reads to accommodate for sequencing errors. The F3 reads were demultiplexed and adaptors removed using Qiita (http://qiita.ucsd.edu) using the parameters max_barcode_errors: 1.5; barcode_type: golay_12; and phred_quality_threshold: 3. The demultiplexed reads for F1, F2, and F3 were then processed using the DADA2 pipeline, trimming the 3′ end of the forward reads to a length of 130 bp, and setting the filter parameters to maxN = 0, maxEE = 2, trunQ = 2, and rm.phix = True. The DADA2 pipeline (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) was followed to obtain an amplicon sequence variant table (“ASV” table), a “higher resolution analogue of the ubiquitous OTU table”. Taxonomy was assigned used the SILVA reference database.Illumina sequence processing—Fungi (Flight sampling 1 and 2) The forward reads were de-multiplexed by using fastq-multx v. 1.02.772, a tool from ea-utils software package [88], with the forward amplification primers fungi as search targets. The 5′-ends of the sorted reads were trimmed for a predetermined length based on the length of the corresponding amplification primer for each dataset. The reads were further processed to remove all remaining sequences of the amplification primers and the Illumina TruSeq adapters from their 3′-ends using consecutively fastq-mcf v. 1.04.807 program [88] for exact sequence search, and agrep (http://www.tgries.de/agrep/) and treagrep (0.8.0: https://github.com/laurikari/tre/) programs for search allowing up to three mismatches between the primers/adapters and the reads to accommodate for sequencing errors. After primers/adapters were removed, the processed reads exhibited multimodal length distribution. The reads from the fungal datasets formed three groups of 184–223 bp, 224–246 bp, and 246–282 bp length. This correlates well with known length variability of ITS sequences from different fungal phyla [89]. Each of the three groups was separately subjected to the OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment procedures, and the results were merged together for further statistical treatment and visualization. ITS1 sequence clustering and taxonomy assignment were performed using USEARCH version 8.1.1756 [90]. For each collection of the related datasets, the OTUs were established by selecting high-quality reads with an expected error rate not exceeding 0.5%. The selected reads were further de-replicated, sorted, clustered at the default 3% difference, and de-chimerized against the UCHIME reference dataset distributed by UNITE [79]. Then, the reads from individual samples were filtered to exclude those with the expected error rate above 6%, and mapped to the OTUs. Taxonomy was assigned using the Warcup training dataset V1 (http://drive5.com/utax/data/utax_warcup_trainset1.tar.gz), with a bootstrap threshold of 50%. The ITS targeted amplicon sequencing for Flight 3 samples did not yield any product to move forward in generating sequences and this might be due to the low fungal biomass of the samples.Statistical analysis Bar graphs and strip charts of CFU and qPCR data were plotted using Prism (GraphPad Software, version 5.0a; Irvine, CA). Significance (P < 0.05) between groups was tested with the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test.Amplicon sequence analysis Bacterial ASV sequences and Fungal OTUs were summarized to the family and/or genus level using QIIME [91]. The ALDEx R package version 2 [70] was used to statistically compare the relative abundances of bacterial family level taxa between the different flights and locations based on the expected values of 128 Dirichlet Monte Carlo instances of centered log ratio (clr) transformed data [71]. A value of zero indicates that organism abundance was equal to the geometric mean abundance. Thus, organisms more abundant than the mean would have positive values, and those less abundant than the mean would have negative values. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P value of the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test (significance threshold P < 0.05). ALDEx2 was also used to compare fungal genus level taxa between flights and differential ASVs and OTUs between samples and controls. The R script of SourceTracker (version 0.9.1), the contamination predictor tool, was used to assess contamination of the samples [92]. ISS surface wipes were designated as sink and the field and Maxwell negative controls as sources. Samples were rarified to 1000 reads. QIIME was also used to calculate Shannon’s diversity and taxa richness. Statistical analysis of Shannon’s diversity and taxa richness was performed in Prism using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with the Benjamini Hochberg FDR multiple test correction. Genus level counts were clr transformed using the “compositions” package in R [93] and visualized with a heat-map created with the “gplot” package in R. Barplots, boxplots, CCA plots, and pie charts were all created in R.Comparison of ISS environmental microbiome with Earth microbiome The ISS environmental microbiome data were processed by Deblur 1.0.4 [94] trimming at 90 nt with defaults except for setting —min-reads 1 to avoid filtering sequences across samples prior to merging sample sets. The published Earth Microbiome Project 90 nt BIOM table [27] was obtained from ftp://ftp.microbo.me. Deblur 1.0.4 90nt BIOM tables of Hospital Microbiome Project (Qiita study 10,172) and Office Succession Study (Qiita study 10,423) were obtained from Gonzalez et al. [95] using redbiom analysis (https://github.com/biocore/redbiom). Only the reference-hit sOTUs were used across all studies including ISS microbiome datasets. All studies were merged using the BIOM Table Python application programming interface (API). Using the API, sOTUs with fewer than 25 total observed sequences were filtered as was previously performed [96] and samples were rarefied to 1000 sequences per sample. The data were then imported into QIIME2 2018.11 [97] and unique sOTUs were inserted into Greengenes 13_8 [98] using SEPP [99] via the QIIME2 fragment-insertion plugin [100]. For UniFrac, fragment insertion was performed, which was previously shown to ameliorate primer biases [100]. Unweighted UniFrac was computed using Striped UniFrac [101] through QIIME2’s diversity plugin with –p-bypass-tips, principal coordinates were computed using FSVD [102] as used elsewhere [101] and the coordinates were visualized using the EMPeror [103] plugin in QIIME2. Unique sOTUs were assessed in a Jupyter Notebook [104] using the BIOM Table API.Controls and nomenclature of the samples Controls were taken in all steps of the study for all three flight sessions. There was a field control “CTL,” which was a wipe that was opened to the ISS environment but was not used for active sampling and a Maxwell “DNACTL,” which was water that was used during the DNA extraction steps instead of surface or control wipe samples and acted as a DNA extraction reagent control. The field controls were either treated with PMA (“CTL_P”) or left untreated (“CTL”). In total, there were ten controls analyzed during bacterial qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing. Likewise, for fungal analysis, the same controls were collected; however, no amplicons were generated for “DNACTL” for either flight nor CTL_P for Flight 1 during qPCR or Illumina library prep and thus were not sent for amplicon sequencing. Similarly, for qPCR and Illumina sequencing, required reagent controls were tested. The samples during this study were designated with flight session number followed by location number (sampling sites). For example, sample number “F1_3” denotes that surface materials were taken from the first flight at location 3 but sample was not treated with PMA, whereas “F1_3P” denotes that same sample was treated with PMA.Additional files Additional file 1: (2.5MB, pdf) Figure S1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed.

    "introduction": "Introduction Extremophiles are of interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) due to their potential to survive hostile and extraterrestrial conditions (Rummel et al., 2002). Bacteria, fungi, and archaea have been shown to thrive in habitats characterized by low nutrient availability (Onofri et al., 2004), desiccation (Barnard et al., 2013), high and low temperatures (McKay et al., 2003; Onofri et al., 2007), acidic and alkaline pH (Gonzalez-Toril et al., 2003; Gonsalves, 2012), or radiation (Zhdanova et al., 2004; Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; Fendrihan et al., 2009; Stan-Lotter and Fendrihan, 2013). There is a need for studies that focus on elucidating microbial survival mechanisms in extreme habitats, as a primary goal of the planetary protection policy is to prevent forward and backward contamination of any celestial bodies and the Earth (Rummel et al., 2002). So far, the majority of such studies have focused on investigating extremophilic bacteria, mainly spore-formers (Nicholson et al., 2012; Tirumalai et al., 2013), and rocks containing fungi (Onofri et al., 2012; Zakharova et al., 2014) however, monolayers of fungal conidia have not been studied. One investigation revealed that the survival of spacecraft-associated bacteria under simulated Mars UV irradiation, is strain-specific and depends on the isolation site (Newcombe et al., 2005). Spacecraft-associated bacteria were more resistant than Bacillus subtillis 168, used as a dosimetric control (Newcombe et al., 2005). Additionally, exposure of B. subtilis 168 spores to dark space conditions (no UV) outside the International Space Station (ISS) and SMC for 559 days induced the expression of genes involved in DNA and protein damage responses, and oxidative and envelope stress (Nicholson et al., 2012). Further, the first-generation of spores of another bacterium, Bacillus pumillus SAFR-032, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) was more UV-C resistant than the ground control counterparts following exposure to space UV conditions for 18 months. Extensive studies into the whole genome of SAFR-032 revealed the presence of several DNA repair-associated genes that may have facilitated its survival and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Further, proteome analysis showed that stress response proteins, like superoxide dismutase, were increased in abundance when compared to the control (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Fungi produce conidia or spores as part of their life cycle. Some of these structures can be more resistant to environmental impact than the typical fungal coenocytic cell. Therefore, molecular characterization and further understanding of fungal resistance to UV-C and SMC are of high importance. Additionally, fungi possess a wide variety of mechanisms to protect against solar radiation, which include enzymes removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation (PR), and the production of pigments such as melanins and melanin-like compounds, and UV-absorbing metabolites that act as sunscreens (Braga et al., 2015). The hardy nature, adaptability and plasticity of fungi enable their persistence in extreme conditions, making them potential contaminants of cleanrooms and, therefore, a forward contamination source. On April 25, 1986 one of the most significant nuclear accidents in history took place. Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) exploded and high levels of released radioactivity turned the surrounding area into a hostile environment. Within the following 18 years over 2,000 fungal isolates were collected from the nuclear power plant, its 30-km Exclusion Zone and beyond, representing some 200 species in over 90 genera (Zhdanova et al., 2004). The observed fungal communities were of low complexity and dominated by melanin-containing strains. Approximately 20% of the isolates displayed a previously unknown phenomenon of growing toward the radiation source referred to as positive radiotropism (Zhdanova et al., 2004; Dighton et al., 2008). Therefore, this unique characteristic of Chernobyl fungi makes them an ideal fungal model for studying adaptation to SMC. Further, the fungal species isolated from Chernobyl have also been detected in built environments, including JPL clean rooms (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015), simulated closed habitats (Blachowicz et al., 2017), and on board of the ISS (Checinska et al., 2015), which further emphasizes the need to study their potential for forward contamination. The ISS is another type of environment that may be considered hostile for microorganisms, featuring constant temperature and humidity, controlled airflow, enhanced irradiation, and microgravity (Mora et al., 2016). Several reports examining microbial burden aboard the ISS have shown that fungal populations thrive in this environment (Checinska et al., 2015; Be et al., 2017). Other studies have investigated molecular adaptations of selected species to space conditions, revealing changes in metabolome, and proteome of ISS-isolated strains (Knox et al., 2016; Romsdahl et al., 2018; Blachowicz et al., 2019). In other investigations, several multilayered or embedded cryptoendolithic fungal communities were exposed to space conditions (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2012, 2015; Scalzi et al., 2012; Pacelli et al., 2018). Tested isolates that adapted to environmental extremes of their habitats survived SMC for extended periods and revealed high stability of the DNA in the surviving cells (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2015; Pacelli et al., 2018). Despite these studies, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate survival of filamentous fungi under SMC and their potential to adapt and survive in outer space. This is the first report that evaluated the survival of Chernobyl-associated and ISS-isolated fungal conidia exposed in monolayers to SMC. Dried monolayers of conidia of four filamentous fungi were exposed to SMC and two strains, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cladosporium cladosporoides, which survived exposure to SMC for 30 min, were further analyzed for phenotypic, proteomic and metabolomic changes.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Sample Collection Sites Subcultures of the isolated strains were obtained from the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, within the framework of a multiyear collaborative research program, to the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). For this study 12 Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated isolates were selected (Table 1). Preparation of Aluminum Coupons With Monolayers of Dried Fungal Conidia High-grade aluminum coupons (Al 6061-T6) were precision cleaned for sterility as previously described (Osman et al., 2008). Each coupon was seeded with 100 μL of conidia suspension to contain ∼105 conidia per coupon. Conidia were counted using a hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) after harvesting 5 days grown cultures at 26°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Conidial suspensions were diluted in molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and ∼105 conidia were added to each coupon followed by drying overnight at the room temperature in a bio-hood. The monolayers of conidia were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (data not shown). UV-C Exposure and Recovery Aluminum coupons with dried fungal conidia were placed in a plastic Petri dish, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using a low-pressure handheld mercury arc UV lamp (model UVG-11; UVP Inc., Upland, CA, United States). The lamp was placed above the sample, and the UV flux at the surface of exposed sample was measured using UVX digital radiometer (UVP Inc.). The exposure time required to produce doses: 0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2,000 J/m2 was calculated at 100 μW cm-2. After exposure to UV-C 100 μL of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37°C for 50 min. Dried PVA along with fungal conidia was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific). The PVA extraction step was repeated. When PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in duplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 26°C. Simulated Martian Conditions (SMC) Survival and response of fungal strains under SMC were tested in a Mars simulation chamber equipped with a UV transparent fused silica window according to a previously described set up (Garry et al., 2006; Osman et al., 2008; Peeters et al., 2010). Coupons prepared following the protocol described above were placed in the sterile Falcon tubes and sent to Netherlands. After arrival (∼1.5 weeks) samples deposited on aluminum coupons were placed inside the simulation chamber and subsequently the chamber was evacuated via an oil-free scroll pump (XDS5, Edwards Vacuum, Crawley, United Kingdom) to reach a base pressure of 20 Pa. While continuously being pumped, the chamber was purged five times with high purity CO2 (99.995%, H20 < 5 ppm, O2 < 5 ppm, Praxair, Danbury, CT, United States), before establishing a continuous CO2 gas flow to maintain a stable chamber pressure of approximately 600 Pa. Samples were exposed at room temperature to simulated solar light (SF150 with a xenon arc lamp, 150W, Sciencetech Inc., London, Canada) via the fused silica window of the simulation chamber. The 200–400 nm wavelength integrated irradiance at the sample distance was 58.7 W/m2 (Figure 6). Samples were exposed for 5 and 30 min to cumulative doses of 2,670 and 16,110 J/m2, respectively, before being removed from the chamber and placed in sterile Falcon tubes for shipment back to JPL (Pasadena, CA, United States) for further analysis. Upon return to JPL, SMC-exposed samples were processed following the aforementioned PVA protocol to assess the survival rates. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab UV spectra (200–400 nm) of the solar simulator employed in this study. Other lighting spectra of Mars models are presented along with the integrated irradiance over the wavelength range from 200 to 400 nm. Secondary Metabolite Extraction and Analysis Aspergillus fumigatus strains were cultivated at 30°C on GMM agar plates while C. cladosporioides strains were grown at 26°C on MEA agar plates starting with 107 conidia/per Petri plate (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped, extracted with 25 mL methanol, and 25 mL of 1:1 methanol/dichloromethane each followed by 1 h sonication and filtration. After the second filtration, combined crude extracts from each isolate were evaporated in vacuo, suspended in 20 mL of water and partitioned with ethylacetate (20 mL). The ethylacetate layer was evaporated in vacuo, re-dissolved in 1 mL of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol and 10 μL was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 × 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for LC/MS was 95% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent B) in 5% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min. Proteome Samples Extraction and Processing Exposure of fungal conidia to SMC required using ∼106 conidia/coupon to avoid the shadowing effect (Osman et al., 2008), however such amount of biomass was not enough to perform detailed proteome analyses. Therefore, to observe permanent alterations in proteomes of SMC-exposed strains when compared to unexposed ones A. fumigatus strains were regrown at 30°C on GMM and C. cladosporioides strains at 26°C on MEA starting with 107 conidia/per Petri plate (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, mycelia and spores from agar plates were collected and stored at -80 °C prior to protein extraction at City of Hope (Duarte, CA, United States). The protein was extracted as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). In brief, mycelia, and spores were lysed and homogenized using a bead beater. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay with a bovine serum albumin standard curve (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, United States). The samples were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as described by Romsdahl et al. (2018) with modification. The proteomic profiling of A. fumigatus and C. cladosporioides strains was carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. A. fumigatus strains ISSFT-021 and ISSFT-021-30 were labeled with TMT6-128 and TMT6-129, respectively. Two biological samples of C. cladosporioides strains IMV00 236 and IMV00 236-30 were labeled with TMT6-128/130 and TMT6-129/131, respectively. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASY-nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph, a 75 μm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and a 75 μm × 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Quantitative Proteomics Analysis All MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Sequest-HT search engines. Protein databases were either A. fumigatus Af293 database from  containing 9845 non-redundant sequences or an in-house annotated draft genome sequence of C. cladosporioides (MSJH00000000). The search parameters were described by Romsdahl et al. (2018). Technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all technical and biological replicates, were considered for the analysis. The identified proteins were then averaged and Log2 transformed. Student t-test was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed between each SMC-exposed and unexposed group. Proteins with p-value ≤ 0.05 were further evaluated for up- and down-regulation using a cut-off value of ≥±2-fold change. AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim terms (Cerqueira et al., 2014) were used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes in SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 while the cluster of orthologous genes (COG) database (Tatusov et al., 2000) used in CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011) was used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30. Genome Annotation Genome annotation of C. cladosporioides IMV 00236 was performed on the deposited assembly (MSJH00000000) with Funannotate (v1.5.1) (Love et al., 2018). Proteins from Capnodiales fungi (Dothideomycetes), Swissprot database (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016), and transcripts from Cladosporium sphaerospermum UM 843 (Ng et al., 2012) were used as informant sequences. Conserved genes were identified from BUSCO core set “ascomycota_odb9” and were used to create training set for ab initio gene prediction by Augustus (Stanke et al., 2006; Simão et al., 2015). The ab initio predictor GenemarkHMM-ES was trained using its self-training procedures (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008). These predictions along with splice-aware aligned proteins using DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2015) followed by refinement with exonerate to improve spliced alignment accuracy (Slater and Birney, 2005). Consensus gene models were generated from the combined evidence with Evidence Modeler (Haas et al., 2008). Predicted gene function from conserved protein domains (El-Gebali et al., 2018), Swissprot (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016) and inferred homology to conserved protein clusters in eggNOGdb (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2018), and secondary metabolite cluster prediction (Blin et al., 2017).",
    "results": "Results Identification of Fungal Strains Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS-isolated strain were included in this study. Eight of the Chernobyl isolates were collected over time from the wall surface of the exploded Unit-4 of ChNPP. The other four fungi isolated from soil within the exclusion zone were included for comparison. The strains used in the study were selected based on their ecological and biological significance from the collection of over 2,000 isolates. Speciation was determined by classical cell and colony morphology-based identification techniques. A smaller set of fungi underwent whole genome sequencing.

Survival of Desiccated Conidial Spores Under UV-C Irradiation The impact of UV-C irradiation on the survival of dried fungal conidia is presented in Supplementary Table 1. Out of 13 irradiated strains, all but three (Beauveria bassiana IMV 00265, Fusarium oxysporum IMV 00293, and Aureobasidium pullulans IMV 00882) survived exposure to the dose of 2,000 J/m2. Two radiotropic strains, Cladosporium sphaerospermum IMV 00045, and Cladosporium cladosporioides IMV 00236, and the non-radiotropic Penicillium citreonigrum IMV 00738 showed survival at the level of 3.48, 3.60, and 2.18%, respectively, which was higher than the ∼0.1% survival rate observed for the other strains (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Rapid decrease in conidia survivability was observed at dose of 500 J/m2 (∼2–3 log reduction). From that point until the doses of 1000 or 2000 J/m2, the decrease in survival was less pronounced. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab UV-C resistance of Chernobyl and ISS-isolated fungal strains. Purified conidia of 13 strains were exposed to various UV-C doses. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. Survival of Desiccated Conidia Under Simulated Mars Conditions (SMC) Based on the initial analysis of survival under SMC (not shown) four fungal strains were exposed to SMC for 5 and 30 min at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Netherlands. All exposed strains, C. cladosporioides IMV 00236, Apiospora montagnei IMV 01851, C. herbarum IMV 00034 and A. fumigatus ISSFT-021, survived exposure to SMC for 5 min, whereas only two strains: C. cladosporioides IMV 00236 and A. fumigatus ISSFT-021 survived exposure for 30 min (Table 2). Probably the most striking observation was the highest survival rate of IMV 00034 after 5 min exposure to SMC followed by complete eradication after 30 min exposure to SMC. However, because the main focus of the manuscript was to discuss the potential of fungi to survive long-term exposure to SMC we did not further investigate why IMV 00034 may be highly tolerant to SMC-exposure for the short time, but it fails to survive during longer exposure. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting question and a topic for further investigation. Table 2.

Secondary Metabolite (SM) Profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus and Cladosporium cladosporioides Exposed to SMC Organic extracts of unexposed ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236, and 30 min SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30 strains were examined to test if exposure to SMC alters SM production. No significant differences were observed in SM production when comparing samples before and after SMC exposure, including yield or type of compound produced, in either of the strains (Figure 2). However, there appeared to be a tendency of increased SM production yield in both strains following exposure to SMC when compared to unexposed counterparts (Figure 2B,D). FIGURE 2.

Proteome Profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus Exposed to SMC The proteomic characterization of SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 revealed 51-up and 24 down-regulated proteins when compared to unexposed ISSFT-021 (fold-change (FC) > | 2|, P < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 2). Analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes revealed that 27 proteins were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, 11 in carbohydrate metabolism, and 10 in stress response (Figure 3). Further, significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included translation (50% of all up-regulated proteins), and carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), whereas significantly over-represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes (12%) (Supplementary Table 3). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab AspGD GO Slim terms of differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT-021-30. Differentially expressed proteins in (FC > |2|, P < 0.05) were mapped to terms representing various biological processes using AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim Mapper.Approximately 50% of all up-regulated proteins in ISSFT-021-30 were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, including proteins that comprise the small and large ribosomal subunit (Table 3). The majority of these proteins were reported to be differentially expressed during the early development of A. fumigatus (Cagas et al., 2011). Both Rpl3 (AFUA_2G11850) and ribosomal protein P0 (AFUA_1G05080), whose expression during conidiation are regulated by BrlAp, were more than twofold up-regulated (Twumasi-Boateng et al., 2009). A number of differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Table 4), including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510), one of the key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle (Olivas et al., 2008). Cellobiohydrolases CbhB (AFUA_6G11610) and AFUA_8G01490, both involved in cellulose degradation, and hydrolase AFUA_5G07080 were more than twofold up-regulated in SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 (Adav et al., 2013). A twofold increase in protein abundance was observed for glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730) (Teutschbein et al., 2010), phosphoglycerate kinase (AFUA_1G10350), and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910) (Albrecht et al., 2010). Among the proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that exhibited decreased abundance were malate and alcohol dehydrogenases [AFUA_6G05210 (Teutschbein et al., 2010), AFUA_5G06240 (Cagas et al., 2011), respectively] and mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (AFUA_4G08410) (Gautam et al., 2011). Several proteins with increased abundance were involved in response to stress (Table 5). Dehydrin-like protein DprC (AFUA_7G04520), which is known to play a role in protecting cells against freezing (Hoi et al., 2011), and AFUA_1G14090, which is predicted to be involved in histidine biosynthesis (Nierman et al., 2005), were twofold up-regulated. Down-regulated stress response proteins included the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (AFUA_1G04900), and the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AFUA_2G01040), and AFUA_8G04890 with a predicted role in response to salt stress (Nierman et al., 2005).

Proteome Profiling of Cladosporium cladosporioides Exposed to SMC The proteomic characterization of C. cladosporioides upon exposure to SMC for 30 min revealed that 51 proteins were up-regulated, and 218 proteins were down-regulated when compared to unexposed IMV 00236 (fold-change (FC) > ∣2∣, P < 0.05) in response to SMC (Supplementary Table 4). The distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30 among biological processes is shown in Figure 4. Among differentially expressed proteins 22 were involved in post-translation modification, protein turnover, and chaperones, 21 in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, 20 in energy production and conversion, and 17 in translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis. Interestingly, the majority of the proteins involved in the translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30 exhibited down-regulation (Table 6), which is the opposite expression pattern to ISSFT-021-30. Additionally, a number of proteins involved in post-translational modification and chaperones (Table 7) showed decreased abundance, including an aspartic endopeptidase (BS090_008183/ENOG410PH8I), which is an ortholog of A. fumigatus AFUA_5G13300 (Nierman et al., 2005). BS090_010805/ENOG410PMR5, an ortholog of mitochondrial matrix cochaperone Mge1p (YOR232W) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Costanzo et al., 2010) was fourfold down-regulated when compared to SMC-unexposed IMV 00236. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism displayed differential abundance (Table 8), including the fourfold up-regulated exo-polygalacturonase involved in pectin degradation BS090_001871/ENOG410PG7M, which is an ortholog of An12g07500 in Aspergillus niger (Martens-Uzunova et al., 2006). Chitin deacetylases BS090_000013 and BS090_000044/ENOG410PMJX, and the chitin recognition protein BS090_010953/ENOG410PMF7 were at least threefold up-regulated. Down-regulated proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism included phosphoglycerate mutase BS090_004087/ENOG410QEDC, which is an ortholog of Aspergillus nidulans AN8720 with a predicted role in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (Masuo et al., 2010), glucanase BS090_003291/ENOG410PM6H, and alpha-amylase BS090_011829/ENOG410PMDW. Differentially expressed proteins involved in energy production and conversion (Table 9) included up-regulated BS090_001715/ENOG410PGTG, an ortholog of A. niger NADPH dehydrogenase (An11g08510), and isocytrate lyase and dehydrogenase BS090_001881/ENOG410PGND, and BS090_000939/ENOG410PFHR, respectively. Proteins with decreased abundance included nitrate reductase BS090_004112/ENOG410PUCE and ATP synthase BS090_005644/ENOG41KOG1758. FIGURE 4.

Increased Resistance to UV-C of SMC Exposed Aspergillus fumigatus Conidia Survival rates of several ISS-isolated and clinical isolates of A. fumigatus following exposure to UV-C are presented in Figure 5. SMC exposed ISSFT-021-30 exhibited increased UV-C resistance (∼20% of conidia survived the UV-C dose of 4,000 J/m2) when compared to unexposed ISSFT-021 and another A. fumigatus ISS isolate IF1SW-F4. Additionally, IF1SW-F4 was more resistant to UV-C exposure, than ISSFT-021 and clinical CEA10 strain, which displayed similar resistance patterns. The clinical isolate Af293 was the most sensitive, showing 2-log reduction when exposed to the highest tested UV-C dose. Exposure experiments were repeated 3 times and showed the same trends. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab UV-C resistance of A. fumigatus ISS-isolated and clinical strains. Purified conidia of ISS-isolated (ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4) SMC-exposed (ISSFT-021-30), and clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) were exposed to varying doses of UV-C. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. The average fungal conidia survival rates from three different experiments are plotted.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Although it has been well documented that bacteria are associated with the spacecraft environment (La Duc et al., 2003, 2004; Newcombe et al., 2005), few studies address the persistence of fungi in this environment (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015). Prepared in monolayers, spacecraft-associated spore-forming bacteria have been shown to survive exposure to UV-C and SMC (Newcombe et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2008), but similar studies have not been performed for fungal conidia. Microorganisms exposed as multilayers are shielded from UV penetration (submicron level) and subsequent UV-damage is prevented, therefore generation of monolayers of tested cells/spores/conidia is crucial for characterizing irradiation-induced microbial lethality. The observed strain-dependent UV-C sensitivity of fungal conidia was not surprising, as similar conclusions were drawn for UV-exposed bacterial species (Osman et al., 2008). Interestingly, ten out of thirteen selected fungal species survived the UV-C dose of 2,000 J/m2, while bacterial species in a similar study survived exposure to 1,000 J/m2 (Osman et al., 2008), suggesting that some extremophilic fungi are as hardy, if not more, than tested bacteria. It should be noted, that conducting experiments that investigate the protective nature of fungi or bacteria could help in understanding the microbial survival in extreme niches, as bacteria and fungi coexist in the environment, and form communities to survive harsh conditions. The space environment varies significantly from Earth. It is characterized by enhanced irradiation and distinct atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it was imperative to assess fungal survival under SMC, as fungi are known to be present during manned space missions. Among the four strains that survived 5-min exposure to SMC two, ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236, survived exposure to SMC for 30 min. Most studies testing survival of microorganisms under SMC have been conducted using bacterial spores or fungal communities. In one such study several Bacillus spp. were tested for simulated Mars UV irradiation tolerance, which resulted in no survival beyond 30 min exposure for all strains except B. pumilus SAFR-032, which was inactivated after 180 min of exposure (Schuerger et al., 2006). However, when B. subtilis spores were exposed to SMC, including irradiation and atmospheric conditions, 99.9% of spores were eradicated within 30 s, and a 15 min exposure resulted in no recovery of viable spores from aluminum coupons (Schuerger et al., 2003). Interestingly, when the more extremotolerant B. pumilus SAFR-032 was tested under SMC, no spores were recovered from the aluminum coupon after 30 min exposure, but bacterial growth was observed once coupons were placed in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Osman et al., 2008). In this study, recovery of fungal conidia exposed in monolayers from aluminum coupons was possible for both ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236 even after 30 min exposure, suggesting an enhanced ability of fungal conidia to withstand such environments. The results from this study, combined with those revealing that cryptoendolithic fungal communities embedded in rocks can withstand SMC for an extended period of time (Onofri et al., 2012, 2015; Pacelli et al., 2018), imply that fungi should be considered as a possible forward contamination source. This is further supported by the fact that the omnipresence of filamentous fungi has been documented in spacecraft assembly facilities (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015). It has been reported that upon exposure to space conditions bacteria become more UV resistant (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Similarly, this study showed that SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 had a higher tolerance to UV irradiation than its unexposed counterpart ISSFT-021. Additionally, it appeared to be more tolerant to UV exposure than any of the additionally tested A. fumigaus strain, including another ISS-isolated strain IF1SW-F4 and two clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. These results suggest that exposure to an enhanced irradiation environment may lead to adaptive alterations that give fungi an increased environmental advantage when exposed to unique space conditions. One significant way that filamentous fungi respond to external stimuli is through alterations in SM production. Although these bioactive molecules are not directly necessary for survival, they often confer an environmental advantage (Keller et al., 2005). Both fungal species subjected to SMC, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, displayed slightly increased yield of produced SMs. Such a tendency agrees with previously observed elevated yields of SM in ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger when compared to culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., unpublished). Additionally, when the metabolome of ISSFT-021 was characterized and compared to the well-studied Af293, production yields of pyripyropene A and fumiquinazolines increased (Knox et al., 2016). Therefore, the observed tendency of increased SM production in strains following exposure to SMC supports the hypothesis that space conditions might have altered secondary metabolite production yields. This study revealed that exposure to SMC altered the proteome of both ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30 when compared to unexposed counterparts. Interestingly, in both species, the highest number of differentially expressed proteins were translation-related ribosomal components. Interestingly, exposed to ionizing radiation C. sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis, and Cryptococcus neoformans showed increased growth when compared to unexposed controls due to electronic changes in melanin (Dadachova et al., 2007), however, in our study only ISSFT-021-30 seemed to follow that pattern, revealing up-regulation of translation-related proteins. Observed opposite expression patterns of translation-related proteins, which underlay species-related unique defense system, may have been shaped by the varying environmental origins of each isolate (Gasch, 2007; Heitman et al., 2017). This discrepancy suggests that different species of filamentous fungi alter their growth and development in response to adverse environmental conditions in a species/strain-specific manner. Furthermore, the difference in the expression levels of translation-related ribosomal protein may lead to the overall up- and down-regulation of other proteins in ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, respectively. Interestingly, ribosomal protein Rpl17, has been indicated as crucial for survival in A. fumigatus (Firon et al., 2003), C. neoformans (Ianiri et al., 2017), and S. cerevisiae (Gamalinda et al., 2013) especially once grown on glucose. Induced abundance of Rpl17 upon exposure to SMC may suggest that it modulates A. fumigatus response to harsh conditions depending on a carbon source. Several differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy conversion, including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510) in proteome of ISSFT-021-30. AcuD is one of the key enzymes in glyoxylate cycle, which facilitates fungal growth on alternative C2 carbon sources (De Lucas et al., 1999). In addition, AcuE, another enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, exhibited increased abundance in ISS-isolated ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10 (Blachowicz et al., 2019). Further, increased abundance of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in the ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger when compared to the well-studied culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). These findings suggest that increased production of starvation-response enzymes play a role in the adaptation to space conditions. Several enzymes involved in chitin recognition and degradation were up-regulated in IMV 00236-30. These enzymes enable using chitinous debris as an alternative carbon source and allow morphogenetic changes during growth and differentiation (Gooday et al., 1986), which further suggests that alterations in carbohydrate metabolism are an adaptive response to SMC. Interestingly, when protein patterns of Cryomyces antarcticus, Knufia perforans, and Exophiala jeanselmei exposed in multilayers to SMC were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis no additional stress-induced proteins were observed (Zakharova et al., 2014). This study affirms the enormous capability of filamentous fungi to adapt to extreme environmental conditions and thrive in a wide variety of ecological niches. To our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun proteomic and metabolomic analyses of filamentous fungi in response to SMC. Such a complex state of the art analyses of fungal adaptive responses to space conditions are essential for ensuring safety in the era of future outer space explorations, as fungi will undoubtedly accompany people during space voyages. Thorough understanding of how filamentous fungi adapt to space conditions is important for both maintaining crew health and preventing biocorrosion of the spacecraft, as both opportunistic pathogenic fungi (Knox et al., 2016) and technophiles (Alekhova et al., 2005) have been reported on board of the ISS and Mir space stations.",

Copyright notice ID: 6529585 PMID: 31156574 Abstract Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021. Keywords: fungi, simulated mars conditions, proteome, metabolome, Chernobyl, international space station, extremophilesIntroduction Extremophiles are of interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) due to their potential to survive hostile and extraterrestrial conditions (Rummel et al., 2002). Bacteria, fungi, and archaea have been shown to thrive in habitats characterized by low nutrient availability (Onofri et al., 2004), desiccation (Barnard et al., 2013), high and low temperatures (McKay et al., 2003; Onofri et al., 2007), acidic and alkaline pH (Gonzalez-Toril et al., 2003; Gonsalves, 2012), or radiation (Zhdanova et al., 2004; Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; Fendrihan et al., 2009; Stan-Lotter and Fendrihan, 2013). There is a need for studies that focus on elucidating microbial survival mechanisms in extreme habitats, as a primary goal of the planetary protection policy is to prevent forward and backward contamination of any celestial bodies and the Earth (Rummel et al., 2002). So far, the majority of such studies have focused on investigating extremophilic bacteria, mainly spore-formers (Nicholson et al., 2012; Tirumalai et al., 2013), and rocks containing fungi (Onofri et al., 2012; Zakharova et al., 2014) however, monolayers of fungal conidia have not been studied. One investigation revealed that the survival of spacecraft-associated bacteria under simulated Mars UV irradiation, is strain-specific and depends on the isolation site (Newcombe et al., 2005). Spacecraft-associated bacteria were more resistant than Bacillus subtillis 168, used as a dosimetric control (Newcombe et al., 2005). Additionally, exposure of B. subtilis 168 spores to dark space conditions (no UV) outside the International Space Station (ISS) and SMC for 559 days induced the expression of genes involved in DNA and protein damage responses, and oxidative and envelope stress (Nicholson et al., 2012). Further, the first-generation of spores of another bacterium, Bacillus pumillus SAFR-032, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) was more UV-C resistant than the ground control counterparts following exposure to space UV conditions for 18 months. Extensive studies into the whole genome of SAFR-032 revealed the presence of several DNA repair-associated genes that may have facilitated its survival and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Further, proteome analysis showed that stress response proteins, like superoxide dismutase, were increased in abundance when compared to the control (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Fungi produce conidia or spores as part of their life cycle. Some of these structures can be more resistant to environmental impact than the typical fungal coenocytic cell. Therefore, molecular characterization and further understanding of fungal resistance to UV-C and SMC are of high importance. Additionally, fungi possess a wide variety of mechanisms to protect against solar radiation, which include enzymes removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation (PR), and the production of pigments such as melanins and melanin-like compounds, and UV-absorbing metabolites that act as sunscreens (Braga et al., 2015). The hardy nature, adaptability and plasticity of fungi enable their persistence in extreme conditions, making them potential contaminants of cleanrooms and, therefore, a forward contamination source. On April 25, 1986 one of the most significant nuclear accidents in history took place. Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) exploded and high levels of released radioactivity turned the surrounding area into a hostile environment. Within the following 18 years over 2,000 fungal isolates were collected from the nuclear power plant, its 30-km Exclusion Zone and beyond, representing some 200 species in over 90 genera (Zhdanova et al., 2004). The observed fungal communities were of low complexity and dominated by melanin-containing strains. Approximately 20% of the isolates displayed a previously unknown phenomenon of growing toward the radiation source referred to as positive radiotropism (Zhdanova et al., 2004; Dighton et al., 2008). Therefore, this unique characteristic of Chernobyl fungi makes them an ideal fungal model for studying adaptation to SMC. Further, the fungal species isolated from Chernobyl have also been detected in built environments, including JPL clean rooms (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015), simulated closed habitats (Blachowicz et al., 2017), and on board of the ISS (Checinska et al., 2015), which further emphasizes the need to study their potential for forward contamination. The ISS is another type of environment that may be considered hostile for microorganisms, featuring constant temperature and humidity, controlled airflow, enhanced irradiation, and microgravity (Mora et al., 2016). Several reports examining microbial burden aboard the ISS have shown that fungal populations thrive in this environment (Checinska et al., 2015; Be et al., 2017). Other studies have investigated molecular adaptations of selected species to space conditions, revealing changes in metabolome, and proteome of ISS-isolated strains (Knox et al., 2016; Romsdahl et al., 2018; Blachowicz et al., 2019). In other investigations, several multilayered or embedded cryptoendolithic fungal communities were exposed to space conditions (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2012, 2015; Scalzi et al., 2012; Pacelli et al., 2018). Tested isolates that adapted to environmental extremes of their habitats survived SMC for extended periods and revealed high stability of the DNA in the surviving cells (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2015; Pacelli et al., 2018). Despite these studies, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate survival of filamentous fungi under SMC and their potential to adapt and survive in outer space. This is the first report that evaluated the survival of Chernobyl-associated and ISS-isolated fungal conidia exposed in monolayers to SMC. Dried monolayers of conidia of four filamentous fungi were exposed to SMC and two strains, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cladosporium cladosporoides, which survived exposure to SMC for 30 min, were further analyzed for phenotypic, proteomic and metabolomic changes.Results Identification of Fungal Strains Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS-isolated strain were included in this study. Eight of the Chernobyl isolates were collected over time from the wall surface of the exploded Unit-4 of ChNPP. The other four fungi isolated from soil within the exclusion zone were included for comparison. The strains used in the study were selected based on their ecological and biological significance from the collection of over 2,000 isolates. Speciation was determined by classical cell and colony morphology-based identification techniques. A smaller set of fungi underwent whole genome sequencing. Names, GenBank accession numbers, and their significance are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Fungal isolates used in the study and their significance.

Out of 13 irradiated strains, all but three (Beauveria bassiana IMV 00265, Fusarium oxysporum IMV 00293, and Aureobasidium pullulans IMV 00882) survived exposure to the dose of 2,000 J/m2. Two radiotropic strains, Cladosporium sphaerospermum IMV 00045, and Cladosporium cladosporioides IMV 00236, and the non-radiotropic Penicillium citreonigrum IMV 00738 showed survival at the level of 3.48, 3.60, and 2.18%, respectively, which was higher than the ∼0.1% survival rate observed for the other strains (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Rapid decrease in conidia survivability was observed at dose of 500 J/m2 (∼2–3 log reduction). From that point until the doses of 1000 or 2000 J/m2, the decrease in survival was less pronounced. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab UV-C resistance of Chernobyl and ISS-isolated fungal strains. Purified conidia of 13 strains were exposed to various UV-C doses. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0.Survival of Desiccated Conidia Under Simulated Mars Conditions (SMC) Based on the initial analysis of survival under SMC (not shown) four fungal strains were exposed to SMC for 5 and 30 min at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Netherlands. All exposed strains, C. cladosporioides IMV 00236, Apiospora montagnei IMV 01851, C. herbarum IMV 00034 and A. fumigatus ISSFT-021, survived exposure to SMC for 5 min, whereas only two strains: C. cladosporioides IMV 00236 and A. fumigatus ISSFT-021 survived exposure for 30 min (Table 2). Probably the most striking observation was the highest survival rate of IMV 00034 after 5 min exposure to SMC followed by complete eradication after 30 min exposure to SMC. However, because the main focus of the manuscript was to discuss the potential of fungi to survive long-term exposure to SMC we did not further investigate why IMV 00034 may be highly tolerant to SMC-exposure for the short time, but it fails to survive during longer exposure. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting question and a topic for further investigation. Table 2.

No significant differences were observed in SM production when comparing samples before and after SMC exposure, including yield or type of compound produced, in either of the strains (Figure 2). However, there appeared to be a tendency of increased SM production yield in both strains following exposure to SMC when compared to unexposed counterparts (Figure 2B,D). FIGURE 2.

Analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes revealed that 27 proteins were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, 11 in carbohydrate metabolism, and 10 in stress response (Figure 3). Further, significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included translation (50% of all up-regulated proteins), and carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), whereas significantly over-represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes (12%) (Supplementary Table 3). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab AspGD GO Slim terms of differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT-021-30. Differentially expressed proteins in (FC > |2|, P < 0.05) were mapped to terms representing various biological processes using AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim Mapper.Approximately 50% of all up-regulated proteins in ISSFT-021-30 were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, including proteins that comprise the small and large ribosomal subunit (Table 3). The majority of these proteins were reported to be differentially expressed during the early development of A. fumigatus (Cagas et al., 2011). Both Rpl3 (AFUA_2G11850) and ribosomal protein P0 (AFUA_1G05080), whose expression during conidiation are regulated by BrlAp, were more than twofold up-regulated (Twumasi-Boateng et al., 2009). A number of differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Table 4), including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510), one of the key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle (Olivas et al., 2008). Cellobiohydrolases CbhB (AFUA_6G11610) and AFUA_8G01490, both involved in cellulose degradation, and hydrolase AFUA_5G07080 were more than twofold up-regulated in SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 (Adav et al., 2013). A twofold increase in protein abundance was observed for glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730) (Teutschbein et al., 2010), phosphoglycerate kinase (AFUA_1G10350), and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910) (Albrecht et al., 2010). Among the proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that exhibited decreased abundance were malate and alcohol dehydrogenases [AFUA_6G05210 (Teutschbein et al., 2010), AFUA_5G06240 (Cagas et al., 2011), respectively] and mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (AFUA_4G08410) (Gautam et al., 2011). Several proteins with increased abundance were involved in response to stress (Table 5). Dehydrin-like protein DprC (AFUA_7G04520), which is known to play a role in protecting cells against freezing (Hoi et al., 2011), and AFUA_1G14090, which is predicted to be involved in histidine biosynthesis (Nierman et al., 2005), were twofold up-regulated. Down-regulated stress response proteins included the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (AFUA_1G04900), and the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AFUA_2G01040), and AFUA_8G04890 with a predicted role in response to salt stress (Nierman et al., 2005).

The distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30 among biological processes is shown in Figure 4. Among differentially expressed proteins 22 were involved in post-translation modification, protein turnover, and chaperones, 21 in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, 20 in energy production and conversion, and 17 in translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis. Interestingly, the majority of the proteins involved in the translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30 exhibited down-regulation (Table 6), which is the opposite expression pattern to ISSFT-021-30. Additionally, a number of proteins involved in post-translational modification and chaperones (Table 7) showed decreased abundance, including an aspartic endopeptidase (BS090_008183/ENOG410PH8I), which is an ortholog of A. fumigatus AFUA_5G13300 (Nierman et al., 2005). BS090_010805/ENOG410PMR5, an ortholog of mitochondrial matrix cochaperone Mge1p (YOR232W) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Costanzo et al., 2010) was fourfold down-regulated when compared to SMC-unexposed IMV 00236. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism displayed differential abundance (Table 8), including the fourfold up-regulated exo-polygalacturonase involved in pectin degradation BS090_001871/ENOG410PG7M, which is an ortholog of An12g07500 in Aspergillus niger (Martens-Uzunova et al., 2006). Chitin deacetylases BS090_000013 and BS090_000044/ENOG410PMJX, and the chitin recognition protein BS090_010953/ENOG410PMF7 were at least threefold up-regulated. Down-regulated proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism included phosphoglycerate mutase BS090_004087/ENOG410QEDC, which is an ortholog of Aspergillus nidulans AN8720 with a predicted role in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (Masuo et al., 2010), glucanase BS090_003291/ENOG410PM6H, and alpha-amylase BS090_011829/ENOG410PMDW. Differentially expressed proteins involved in energy production and conversion (Table 9) included up-regulated BS090_001715/ENOG410PGTG, an ortholog of A. niger NADPH dehydrogenase (An11g08510), and isocytrate lyase and dehydrogenase BS090_001881/ENOG410PGND, and BS090_000939/ENOG410PFHR, respectively. Proteins with decreased abundance included nitrate reductase BS090_004112/ENOG410PUCE and ATP synthase BS090_005644/ENOG41KOG1758. FIGURE 4.

SMC exposed ISSFT-021-30 exhibited increased UV-C resistance (∼20% of conidia survived the UV-C dose of 4,000 J/m2) when compared to unexposed ISSFT-021 and another A. fumigatus ISS isolate IF1SW-F4. Additionally, IF1SW-F4 was more resistant to UV-C exposure, than ISSFT-021 and clinical CEA10 strain, which displayed similar resistance patterns. The clinical isolate Af293 was the most sensitive, showing 2-log reduction when exposed to the highest tested UV-C dose. Exposure experiments were repeated 3 times and showed the same trends. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab UV-C resistance of A. fumigatus ISS-isolated and clinical strains. Purified conidia of ISS-isolated (ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4) SMC-exposed (ISSFT-021-30), and clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) were exposed to varying doses of UV-C. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. The average fungal conidia survival rates from three different experiments are plotted.Discussion Although it has been well documented that bacteria are associated with the spacecraft environment (La Duc et al., 2003, 2004; Newcombe et al., 2005), few studies address the persistence of fungi in this environment (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015). Prepared in monolayers, spacecraft-associated spore-forming bacteria have been shown to survive exposure to UV-C and SMC (Newcombe et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2008), but similar studies have not been performed for fungal conidia. Microorganisms exposed as multilayers are shielded from UV penetration (submicron level) and subsequent UV-damage is prevented, therefore generation of monolayers of tested cells/spores/conidia is crucial for characterizing irradiation-induced microbial lethality. The observed strain-dependent UV-C sensitivity of fungal conidia was not surprising, as similar conclusions were drawn for UV-exposed bacterial species (Osman et al., 2008). Interestingly, ten out of thirteen selected fungal species survived the UV-C dose of 2,000 J/m2, while bacterial species in a similar study survived exposure to 1,000 J/m2 (Osman et al., 2008), suggesting that some extremophilic fungi are as hardy, if not more, than tested bacteria. It should be noted, that conducting experiments that investigate the protective nature of fungi or bacteria could help in understanding the microbial survival in extreme niches, as bacteria and fungi coexist in the environment, and form communities to survive harsh conditions. The space environment varies significantly from Earth. It is characterized by enhanced irradiation and distinct atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it was imperative to assess fungal survival under SMC, as fungi are known to be present during manned space missions. Among the four strains that survived 5-min exposure to SMC two, ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236, survived exposure to SMC for 30 min. Most studies testing survival of microorganisms under SMC have been conducted using bacterial spores or fungal communities. In one such study several Bacillus spp. were tested for simulated Mars UV irradiation tolerance, which resulted in no survival beyond 30 min exposure for all strains except B. pumilus SAFR-032, which was inactivated after 180 min of exposure (Schuerger et al., 2006). However, when B. subtilis spores were exposed to SMC, including irradiation and atmospheric conditions, 99.9% of spores were eradicated within 30 s, and a 15 min exposure resulted in no recovery of viable spores from aluminum coupons (Schuerger et al., 2003). Interestingly, when the more extremotolerant B. pumilus SAFR-032 was tested under SMC, no spores were recovered from the aluminum coupon after 30 min exposure, but bacterial growth was observed once coupons were placed in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Osman et al., 2008). In this study, recovery of fungal conidia exposed in monolayers from aluminum coupons was possible for both ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236 even after 30 min exposure, suggesting an enhanced ability of fungal conidia to withstand such environments. The results from this study, combined with those revealing that cryptoendolithic fungal communities embedded in rocks can withstand SMC for an extended period of time (Onofri et al., 2012, 2015; Pacelli et al., 2018), imply that fungi should be considered as a possible forward contamination source. This is further supported by the fact that the omnipresence of filamentous fungi has been documented in spacecraft assembly facilities (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015). It has been reported that upon exposure to space conditions bacteria become more UV resistant (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Similarly, this study showed that SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 had a higher tolerance to UV irradiation than its unexposed counterpart ISSFT-021. Additionally, it appeared to be more tolerant to UV exposure than any of the additionally tested A. fumigaus strain, including another ISS-isolated strain IF1SW-F4 and two clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. These results suggest that exposure to an enhanced irradiation environment may lead to adaptive alterations that give fungi an increased environmental advantage when exposed to unique space conditions. One significant way that filamentous fungi respond to external stimuli is through alterations in SM production. Although these bioactive molecules are not directly necessary for survival, they often confer an environmental advantage (Keller et al., 2005). Both fungal species subjected to SMC, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, displayed slightly increased yield of produced SMs. Such a tendency agrees with previously observed elevated yields of SM in ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger when compared to culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., unpublished). Additionally, when the metabolome of ISSFT-021 was characterized and compared to the well-studied Af293, production yields of pyripyropene A and fumiquinazolines increased (Knox et al., 2016). Therefore, the observed tendency of increased SM production in strains following exposure to SMC supports the hypothesis that space conditions might have altered secondary metabolite production yields. This study revealed that exposure to SMC altered the proteome of both ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30 when compared to unexposed counterparts. Interestingly, in both species, the highest number of differentially expressed proteins were translation-related ribosomal components. Interestingly, exposed to ionizing radiation C. sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis, and Cryptococcus neoformans showed increased growth when compared to unexposed controls due to electronic changes in melanin (Dadachova et al., 2007), however, in our study only ISSFT-021-30 seemed to follow that pattern, revealing up-regulation of translation-related proteins. Observed opposite expression patterns of translation-related proteins, which underlay species-related unique defense system, may have been shaped by the varying environmental origins of each isolate (Gasch, 2007; Heitman et al., 2017). This discrepancy suggests that different species of filamentous fungi alter their growth and development in response to adverse environmental conditions in a species/strain-specific manner. Furthermore, the difference in the expression levels of translation-related ribosomal protein may lead to the overall up- and down-regulation of other proteins in ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, respectively. Interestingly, ribosomal protein Rpl17, has been indicated as crucial for survival in A. fumigatus (Firon et al., 2003), C. neoformans (Ianiri et al., 2017), and S. cerevisiae (Gamalinda et al., 2013) especially once grown on glucose. Induced abundance of Rpl17 upon exposure to SMC may suggest that it modulates A. fumigatus response to harsh conditions depending on a carbon source. Several differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy conversion, including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510) in proteome of ISSFT-021-30. AcuD is one of the key enzymes in glyoxylate cycle, which facilitates fungal growth on alternative C2 carbon sources (De Lucas et al., 1999). In addition, AcuE, another enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, exhibited increased abundance in ISS-isolated ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10 (Blachowicz et al., 2019). Further, increased abundance of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in the ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger when compared to the well-studied culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). These findings suggest that increased production of starvation-response enzymes play a role in the adaptation to space conditions. Several enzymes involved in chitin recognition and degradation were up-regulated in IMV 00236-30. These enzymes enable using chitinous debris as an alternative carbon source and allow morphogenetic changes during growth and differentiation (Gooday et al., 1986), which further suggests that alterations in carbohydrate metabolism are an adaptive response to SMC. Interestingly, when protein patterns of Cryomyces antarcticus, Knufia perforans, and Exophiala jeanselmei exposed in multilayers to SMC were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis no additional stress-induced proteins were observed (Zakharova et al., 2014). This study affirms the enormous capability of filamentous fungi to adapt to extreme environmental conditions and thrive in a wide variety of ecological niches. To our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun proteomic and metabolomic analyses of filamentous fungi in response to SMC. Such a complex state of the art analyses of fungal adaptive responses to space conditions are essential for ensuring safety in the era of future outer space explorations, as fungi will undoubtedly accompany people during space voyages. Thorough understanding of how filamentous fungi adapt to space conditions is important for both maintaining crew health and preventing biocorrosion of the spacecraft, as both opportunistic pathogenic fungi (Knox et al., 2016) and technophiles (Alekhova et al., 2005) have been reported on board of the ISS and Mir space stations.Materials and Methods Sample Collection Sites Subcultures of the isolated strains were obtained from the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, within the framework of a multiyear collaborative research program, to the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). For this study 12 Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated isolates were selected (Table 1).Preparation of Aluminum Coupons With Monolayers of Dried Fungal Conidia High-grade aluminum coupons (Al 6061-T6) were precision cleaned for sterility as previously described (Osman et al., 2008). Each coupon was seeded with 100 μL of conidia suspension to contain ∼105 conidia per coupon. Conidia were counted using a hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) after harvesting 5 days grown cultures at 26°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Conidial suspensions were diluted in molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and ∼105 conidia were added to each coupon followed by drying overnight at the room temperature in a bio-hood. The monolayers of conidia were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (data not shown).UV-C Exposure and Recovery Aluminum coupons with dried fungal conidia were placed in a plastic Petri dish, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using a low-pressure handheld mercury arc UV lamp (model UVG-11; UVP Inc., Upland, CA, United States). The lamp was placed above the sample, and the UV flux at the surface of exposed sample was measured using UVX digital radiometer (UVP Inc.). The exposure time required to produce doses: 0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2,000 J/m2 was calculated at 100 μW cm-2. After exposure to UV-C 100 μL of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37°C for 50 min. Dried PVA along with fungal conidia was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific). The PVA extraction step was repeated. When PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in duplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 26°C.Simulated Martian Conditions (SMC) Survival and response of fungal strains under SMC were tested in a Mars simulation chamber equipped with a UV transparent fused silica window according to a previously described set up (Garry et al., 2006; Osman et al., 2008; Peeters et al., 2010). Coupons prepared following the protocol described above were placed in the sterile Falcon tubes and sent to Netherlands. After arrival (∼1.5 weeks) samples deposited on aluminum coupons were placed inside the simulation chamber and subsequently the chamber was evacuated via an oil-free scroll pump (XDS5, Edwards Vacuum, Crawley, United Kingdom) to reach a base pressure of 20 Pa. While continuously being pumped, the chamber was purged five times with high purity CO2 (99.995%, H20 < 5 ppm, O2 < 5 ppm, Praxair, Danbury, CT, United States), before establishing a continuous CO2 gas flow to maintain a stable chamber pressure of approximately 600 Pa. Samples were exposed at room temperature to simulated solar light (SF150 with a xenon arc lamp, 150W, Sciencetech Inc., London, Canada) via the fused silica window of the simulation chamber. The 200–400 nm wavelength integrated irradiance at the sample distance was 58.7 W/m2 (Figure 6). Samples were exposed for 5 and 30 min to cumulative doses of 2,670 and 16,110 J/m2, respectively, before being removed from the chamber and placed in sterile Falcon tubes for shipment back to JPL (Pasadena, CA, United States) for further analysis. Upon return to JPL, SMC-exposed samples were processed following the aforementioned PVA protocol to assess the survival rates. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab UV spectra (200–400 nm) of the solar simulator employed in this study. Other lighting spectra of Mars models are presented along with the integrated irradiance over the wavelength range from 200 to 400 nm.Secondary Metabolite Extraction and Analysis Aspergillus fumigatus strains were cultivated at 30°C on GMM agar plates while C. cladosporioides strains were grown at 26°C on MEA agar plates starting with 107 conidia/per Petri plate (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped, extracted with 25 mL methanol, and 25 mL of 1:1 methanol/dichloromethane each followed by 1 h sonication and filtration. After the second filtration, combined crude extracts from each isolate were evaporated in vacuo, suspended in 20 mL of water and partitioned with ethylacetate (20 mL). The ethylacetate layer was evaporated in vacuo, re-dissolved in 1 mL of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol and 10 μL was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 × 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for LC/MS was 95% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent B) in 5% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min.Proteome Samples Extraction and Processing Exposure of fungal conidia to SMC required using ∼106 conidia/coupon to avoid the shadowing effect (Osman et al., 2008), however such amount of biomass was not enough to perform detailed proteome analyses. Therefore, to observe permanent alterations in proteomes of SMC-exposed strains when compared to unexposed ones A. fumigatus strains were regrown at 30°C on GMM and C. cladosporioides strains at 26°C on MEA starting with 107 conidia/per Petri plate (D = 10 cm). After 5 days, mycelia and spores from agar plates were collected and stored at -80 °C prior to protein extraction at City of Hope (Duarte, CA, United States). The protein was extracted as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). In brief, mycelia, and spores were lysed and homogenized using a bead beater. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay with a bovine serum albumin standard curve (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, United States). The samples were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as described by Romsdahl et al. (2018) with modification. The proteomic profiling of A. fumigatus and C. cladosporioides strains was carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. A. fumigatus strains ISSFT-021 and ISSFT-021-30 were labeled with TMT6-128 and TMT6-129, respectively. Two biological samples of C. cladosporioides strains IMV00 236 and IMV00 236-30 were labeled with TMT6-128/130 and TMT6-129/131, respectively. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASY-nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph, a 75 μm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and a 75 μm × 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018).Quantitative Proteomics Analysis All MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Sequest-HT search engines. Protein databases were either A. fumigatus Af293 database from  containing 9845 non-redundant sequences or an in-house annotated draft genome sequence of C. cladosporioides (MSJH00000000). The search parameters were described by Romsdahl et al. (2018). Technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all technical and biological replicates, were considered for the analysis. The identified proteins were then averaged and Log2 transformed. Student t-test was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed between each SMC-exposed and unexposed group. Proteins with p-value ≤ 0.05 were further evaluated for up- and down-regulation using a cut-off value of ≥±2-fold change. AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim terms (Cerqueira et al., 2014) were used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes in SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 while the cluster of orthologous genes (COG) database (Tatusov et al., 2000) used in CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011) was used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC-exposed IMV 00236-30.Genome Annotation Genome annotation of C. cladosporioides IMV 00236 was performed on the deposited assembly (MSJH00000000) with Funannotate (v1.5.1) (Love et al., 2018). Proteins from Capnodiales fungi (Dothideomycetes), Swissprot database (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016), and transcripts from Cladosporium sphaerospermum UM 843 (Ng et al., 2012) were used as informant sequences. Conserved genes were identified from BUSCO core set “ascomycota_odb9” and were used to create training set for ab initio gene prediction by Augustus (Stanke et al., 2006; Simão et al., 2015). The ab initio predictor GenemarkHMM-ES was trained using its self-training procedures (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008). These predictions along with splice-aware aligned proteins using DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2015) followed by refinement with exonerate to improve spliced alignment accuracy (Slater and Birney, 2005). Consensus gene models were generated from the combined evidence with Evidence Modeler (Haas et al., 2008). Predicted gene function from conserved protein domains (El-Gebali et al., 2018), Swissprot (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016) and inferred homology to conserved protein clusters in eggNOGdb (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2018), and secondary metabolite cluster prediction (Blin et al., 2017).Author Contributions AB drafted the manuscript, carried out the UV-C exposure experiments, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation and strain identification.
