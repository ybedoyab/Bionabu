    "abstract": "Abstract The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages. Subject terms: Retinal diseases, Epigenomics, Transcriptomics",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight hazards such as microgravity and space radiation are anticipated to impact biological systems and could potentially affect crew health and performance both in mission and once astronauts return to Earth. These unique hazards have been thought to induce adverse changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with a frequently reported impact on ocular function1–4. Resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the International Space Station (ISS) are limited and it is difficult to recreate spaceflight conditions on the ground for controlled experiments. Therefore, characterization of the type and magnitude of these changes is challenging. Despite these challenges, analogs can be used to inform the understanding of the spaceflight environment impacts on biology and support development of mitigation strategies to reduce spaceflight health risks. Ground-based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, advances in bioinformatics have expanded the potential scientific return of prior experiments provided data is accessible for re-evaluation. Fortunately, NASA’s GeneLab is an open-access omics database for space-relevant biological experiments that provides access to uniformly formatted data5. The current study leverages transcriptomic and methylation sequencing data acquired as part of a larger experiment to understand the longitudinal effects and underlying mechanisms of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure and hindlimb unloading (HLU; an analog for microgravity) on neurovascular oxidative stress and brain function6. Global transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq quantifies gene expression at the time of sample acquisition while reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyzes DNA methylation, which is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications involved in disease development7–9. Previous studies analyzed spaceflight-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic response in murine retina10,11 or evaluated response to different ground-based hazard analogs in murine brain6 and spleen12. The spaceflight studies reported expression and methylation changes in genes known to be involved in visual perception, phototransduction, and macular degeneration pathways in murine models. However, these studies were performed in space where effects of both space radiation and microgravity on the retina were intertwined. In addition, these studies were performed 35–37 days after a spaceflight and there was no analysis done on longitudinal changes in the retina due to radiation or microgravity. To our knowledge, the current analysis is the first multi-omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We report differentially expressed genes (DEG), differentially methylated genes (DMG), and biological processes (BP) that are exclusive to, or shared across, multiple exposure conditions and post-exposure time points. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the NASA Twins Study13 and in the retina of mice flown to space11, with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure. This study provides an insight into the retinal response to exposures that are frequently used as analogs for individual spaceflight hazard and their interplay at different post-exposure stages, and contributes towards identifying key pathways to interrogate that may provide translational relevance across exposure types.",
    "methods": "Methods Experimental conditions The original study was conducted at Loma Linda University following recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals50 and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). A detailed description of the experimental setup has been published previously51. Briefly, a total of 59 six-month-old, female C57BL/6 J mice were housed in cages of same dimensions and subjected to one of four experimental conditions: sham control with no radiation or unloading (N = 15), hindlimb unloading (N = 14), low-dose irradiation (N = 15), and a combination of hindlimb unloading and low-dose irradiation (N = 15) for 21 days (Supplementary Table 1). Hindlimb suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Gamma radiation was delivered using 57Co plates placed underneath the cages and a dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h was used to deliver a total dose of 0.04 Gy over a period of 21 days to simulate a space radiation environment. For the combination group, mice were exposed to unloading and simultaneously irradiated by 57Co plate placed underneath the cages. Mice from each exposure condition were then allowed a post-exposure period of 7 days, 1 month, or 4 months, following which mice were euthanized and retinas were collected and frozen. RNA and DNA libraries were constructed and used for RNA-Seq and RRBS. The resulting data was deposited to GeneLab where RNA-seq output was processed per NASA GeneLab RNA-seq pipeline52, and RRBS results are available in the form of raw sequencing reads. Unnormalized RNA-seq counts and raw RRBS FastQ files were downloaded from GeneLab and used for the current analysis. Differential gene expression analysis Unnormalized RNA-seq counts were downloaded from GeneLab. Out of a total of 59 samples (Supplementary Table S1), three were excluded from expression analysis due to low RNA integrity number values or high ribosomal RNA contamination. These counts were generated with GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline, which includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps. Full details of the pipeline including the parameters used for each individual tool have been previously published52. RNA-seq counts were subsequently analyzed with DESeq2 (v1.30.1)53 where counts were first normalized using the median-of-ratios method followed by differential gene expression analysis comparing each experimental group to the corresponding post-exposure time point-matched control group. Differentially expressed genes were determined using cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 for log2(fold-change) and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value, respectively, to be consistent with analyses of brain and spleen tissues from the same set of mice6,12. R packages ggplot254, ComplexHeatmap55 and pheatmap56 were used for visualization and generating heatmaps. Differential methylation analysis Raw RRBS reads were downloaded from GeneLab and processed with nf-core/methylseq pipeline (https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq; v1.6.1 accessed on June 23rd, 2021). In short, FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) was used for running quality checks on reads, adapter sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! for Cutadapt57 without the –rrbs option as recommended for NuGEN RRBS Ovation kit, NuGEN’s diversity trimming script was run, and Bismark58 was used for alignment and methylation call extraction. Deduplication based on overlapping coordinates was skipped as it is not recommended for RRBS59. Two samples were excluded from methylation analysis due to GC content bias. Mean Phred quality score across each base position in the read was confirmed to be ≥ 20 (Supplementary Fig. 4), and MethylKit (v1.16.1)60 was used for detection of differentially methylated loci with a cutoff of 0.05 and 10% for a sliding linear model adjusted p-value61 and magnitude of methylation difference, respectively11. As a complementary approach, methylation differences were also calculated over 100-bp tiling windows to obtain differentially methylated regions60. Sites and regions were mapped to known genes (mm10 assembly) and known CpG islands using genomation62 and GenomicRanges63 packages. Promoter regions were defined as 2 kbp upstream and downstream of annotated transcription start sites. Differentially methylated genes were defined as genes containing at least one DML or DMR within their promoter region or gene body. For determination of overlap between differential expression and methylation, no thresholds for fold-change or methylation difference were used to allow for genes with modest, but still significant (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), changes to be observed. Gene set enrichment and over-representation analyses GSEA for gene expression and over-representation analysis for methylation were conducted with the ClusterProfiler (v3.18,1) package64 against the biological process GO category using gseGO and enrichGO functions, and against KEGG pathways using enrichKEGG. Wald test statistics from DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis were used to rank genes for enrichment analysis. Appropriate background gene lists were created by selecting all genes expressed in the retina or covered by at least one CpG site (within ± 2 kb of the gene) for expression (GSEA) and methylation (ORA) data, respectively. A Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 was used for selecting enriched terms. REVIGO65 was used for reducing significant biological processes to a representative non-redundant set of terms. ORA was performed separately on hypo and hypermethylated genes to obtain significantly enriched GO biological processes (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) based on differential methylation in each group. Following adjustments were made to GSEA and ORA to allow for the discovery of overlapping candidate processes and genes between expression and methylation that can be further validated: (a) differentially methylated genes were defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 10%) or DMR (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 2%); regulated methylation targets are routinely clustered into short genomic regions66 and a lower threshold for methylation difference in DMR (2%) is recommended for enrichment analysis since perturbed processes can be a cumulative effect of multiple DMR with small effects67, and (b) an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.25 was used for detecting overlapping biological processes based on differential methylation and expression; GSEA guidelines recommend a 25% false discovery rate (FDR) for exploratory analyses as a more stringent threshold can exclude significant results even before they can be validated68. Enrichr69 and ToppGene70 were used for disease term and functional enrichment analysis.",
    "results": "Results Differential gene expression Post-exposure timepoints had different global expression patterns that were visible in principal component analysis where samples clustered more closely based on time point/age of mice instead of the exposure condition (Supplementary Fig. 1A). For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group (Supplementary Table S1) was compared to a control group (no radiation or HLU) with matched post-exposure duration, and significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons (Table 1, Fig. 1A,B). While the samples clustered by time point/age based on global gene expression, they could be separated by exposure condition within each time point when genes were selected based on differential expression (Supplementary Fig. 1B, Fig. 1B).

The X-axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set.

DESeq2 was used for differential gene expression analysis and R packages ggplot2, pheatmap and ComplexUpset were used for visualization. DEG differentially expressed genes, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation.The number of DEGs peaked at 7 days for groups exposed to only hindlimb unloading (HLU) or irradiation (IR) and showed a subsequent decline. The 275 DEG identified in 7-days IR were enriched in ocular disease terms (Supplementary Table S2) whereas the 71 DEG identified in HLU alone had no significant enrichment of disease pathways. In the 1-month IR group, 7 out of the 31 DEG showed > twofold change (down-regulated: Pon1, Sult1c1, Ermn, Stra6, Tmem72, Gm24514; up-regulated: Bc1). Stra6 and Pon1 are known to be involved in microphthalmia and diabetic retinopathy, respectively and Bc1 affects vascular development14 and structural plasticity15. Prss56, a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia16, was the only DEG at 4 months after exposure to IR alone. The highest number of DEG within HLU + IR (combination of hindlimb unloading and irradiation) was detected at 1 month post-exposure with no DEG at 7 days. The 64 DEG at 1 month included 20 genes with enrichment (adjusted p-value 8.24e-08) in the somatodendritic compartment of the neuron where synaptic inputs are received and integrated, and 15 genes known to be targets of mmu-miR-466, a miRNA that regulates age-related macular degeneration (AMD)17 (Supplementary Table S3). Overlapping differentially expressed genes across exposure groups Nine DEG were common between the HLU-only and IR-only groups at 7 days (down-regulated: Arl2bp, Chrna6, Egln1, Map2k1, Stmn2; up-regulated: Ccn2, Mbd6, Sox9, St6galnac2, Zfp36l1) (Fig. 1C). Bc1 and Pgk1 were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups at 1 month. Zinc finger protein Zc3h11a was significantly down-regulated in the HLU only group at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month. Zc3h11a expression has been shown to be altered in the murine retina and sclera in an experimental myopia mouse model18. Only a single common DEG was observed between the HLU + IR and HLU groups at 4 months (mt-Co2; up-regulated). mt-Co2 is in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is an essential subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain19. An integrated analysis of mammalian spaceflight data has reported the kidney to show an induction of mt-Co220. Differential DNA methylation The 1-month HLU + IR group showed the highest total number (957) of differentially methylated loci (DML) and regions (DMR) in known genes (Table 1, Fig. 2A). In all exposure groups, hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation. Among the hypermethylated loci, a higher proportion of methylation differences were associated with CpG shores than with islands except in all three exposures at 4 months (Fig. 2A). Conversely, more hypomethylated loci overlapped with CpG islands than with shores in most of the groups except in all three groups at 7 days. The exposure groups at 4 months contained a higher proportion of total DML within CpG islands than shores compared to the other time points. Top 1% DML (roughly equivalent to methylation difference ≥ 20%; Supplementary Fig. 2) within CpG islands and exclusive to 4 months post-exposure were found in 17 genes across HLU (hypo: Utp14a; hyper: Dlgap3), IR (hypo: Gm7855, Rtn4rl2; hyper: Maz, Shank3), and HLU + IR (hypo: Bag3; hyper: Aspdh, Map7d1, Map7d2, Morc4, Pcdh1, Pdzd11, Pik3ap1, Rtn4rl2, Suv39h1, Xk).

(A) Total number of differentially methylated loci and regions within genes with hyper- or hypo-methylation in each exposure group categorized by whether they overlap with known CpG islands or shores. (B) Pairwise correlation plots for common differentially methylated sites. Differentially methylated loci (DML) with an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 were selected from each of the nine groups and pairwise correlation for methylation difference was plotted for any given pair. The diagonal shows distribution of methylation difference (%) between exposure and matched control group. Pearson correlation value and significance are displayed on the right of the diagonal, and scatter plots with methylation differences for common DML from any two given groups are displayed on the left. Only significant correlations (> 3 shared DML and p-value ≤ 0.05) are displayed. (C) Upset plot showing differentially methylated genes (DMG), defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML or DMR (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 10%), shared between at least two of the nine groups. The Y-axis represents the number of genes in a given intersection set. The X-axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set. Dots are colored by exposure condition (magenta for IR, green for HLU, orange for combination). R package MethylKit was used for differential methylation analysis, genomation and GenomicRanges were used for annotation of DML, and ggplot2, ggpairs and ComplexUpset were used for visualization. DML/R/G differentially methylated loci/region/gene, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation.Correlation in methylation differences across exposure groups Pairwise analysis of all methylated loci in genes were compared across our 9 exposure groups (Fig. 2B). The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post-exposure time point. Hypermethylation of Bclaf3 promoter was observed in four groups (~ 15% in 1m HLU, 4m IR and 4m HLU + IR, and 26% in 1m HLU + IR), and another CpG island in Tmc8 promoter was common across all three exposure groups at 7 days (10% hypermethylation). The top DMLs shared across all three exposures were in Cav2 at 7 days (30% hypermethylation), Grip2 at 1 month (20% hypermethylation), and Sorbs2 at 4 months (8% hypermethylation).Overlapping differentially methylated genes across exposure groups A number of genes containing DML or DMR were observed in multiple exposure groups and post-exposure time points (Fig. 2C). Bcl11b, Bclaf3, Gse1, Necab2, Plec and Tafa5 were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups. Six genes (Adamts5, Gse1, Rbm15b, Fscn2, Satb1, Tenm3) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure, with Adamts5 and Fscn2 promoters being hypermethylated even after 4 months of exposure to radiation alone. The promoter region of Pcdh19, a protocadherin, was hypermethylated (> 20% methylation difference) at all three time points for HLU + IR and also in HLU alone at 7 days. Bclaf3 was hypermethylated in five groups (HLU at 7 days and 1 month, HLU + IR at 1 month and 4 months, and IR and 4 months), and CpG islands in Hmgb3 promoter were hypermethylated in HLU and HLU + IR at both, 7 days and 1 month. Biological processes affected by low-dose radiation and hindlimb unloading across multiple conditions and post-exposure time points Shared and exclusive biological processes across exposures and time points based on differential expression The top BP significantly enriched across all conditions 7 days after exposure included morphogenesis of epithelium, ATP metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S4). Processes related to epithelial morphogenesis were activated in the exposure groups, whereas all other processes were suppressed across the three conditions. All shared processes were activated in the 1-month groups, with the exception of axon guidance and cell junction assembly, which were suppressed in the radiation only group. Common processes in the 1-month groups were related to amine transport, regulation of membrane potential, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and neurotransmitter transport. At 4 months post-exposure, the top processes shared across the three exposure conditions were suppressed. These included lens development in camera-type eye, wound healing, angiogenesis, and sulfur compound metabolic process. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Common biological processes enriched in different exposure groups and at different time points. (A) Top 20 significantly enriched BP common across all exposure conditions for a given time point. (B) Significantly enriched BP common across all time points for a given exposure condition. Size of each point represents magnitude of normalized enrichment score (NES) while the color indicates activation (red) or suppression (blue) of the BP in the given exposure group compared to time point-matched controls. The Y-axis provides a description of common GO BP and the X-axis lists the ratio of genes that belong to a given gene set to the total number of genes in the gene set. ClusterProfiler was used for gene set enrichment analysis and the R package ggplot2 was used for visualization. BP biological processes, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation, NES normalized enrichment score.Processes that were significantly enriched at all post-exposure time points for a given exposure condition were evaluated (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S4). Nucleotide metabolism was suppressed at 7 days and 4 months but activated at 1 month in mice subjected to microgravity alone, whereas epithelial tube morphogenesis and lens development were activated at 7 days but suppressed at all later time points, and detection of light stimulus was suppressed at 7 days and subsequently activated at 1 month and 4 months. Retina homeostasis was suppressed in the radiation only groups at 7 days and 1 month but activated at 4 months, eye morphogenesis was activated at 7 days and suppressed subsequently, and synaptic vesicle endocytosis was suppressed at 7 days but activated at all later time points. In the combination groups, postsynapse assembly was activated at all time points, nucleotide metabolism was activated only at 1 month, and Rho signal transduction was activated at 7 days and 1 month followed by suppression at 4 months. Nucleotide metabolism and related processes were significantly enriched in all nine groups with consistent activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Pdk1 was within the gene set for nucleotide metabolism processes across all nine groups, and its expression was decreased at 7 days and 4 months but increased at 1 month in all exposure groups (Supplementary Fig. 3). Pdk1 is a kinase known to play a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is involved in cellular response to hypoxia21. As a complementary approach to examining shared processes, BP exclusive to each exposure condition (enriched in ≥ 2 post-exposure time points), or exclusive to each post-exposure time point were also examined (Table 2, Supplementary Table S5). Processes related to microtubule dynamics were enriched exclusively in HLU alone. IR-specific BP included DNA conformation changes, Golgi organization, protein-DNA complex assembly, and type I interferon response. The BP activated exclusively in IR but not enriched in HLU + IR at 7 days included response to wounding, innate immune response, regulation of interleukin-6 production, heart morphogenesis, lipid metabolism, and epithelial cell proliferation. The processes suppressed exclusively in IR were related to telomere organization, DNA repair, ncRNA metabolism, detection of light stimulus, and organelle localization by membrane tethering. Lastly, BP exclusive to HLU + IR were postsynaptic density organization and regulation of AMPA receptors. Each post-exposure time point was associated with distinct BP enriched across multiple conditions only at the given time point. At 7 days, BP related to proteasomal protein catabolism were suppressed in all groups, and mammary gland morphogenesis was activated in IR and HLU + IR. Oncogenesis in the retina and breast have been linked by the regulation of cyclin D122; the gene encoding cyclin D1, Ccnd1, was significantly up-regulated 7 days after exposure to IR but was not differentially expressed at the later time points. mRNA catabolic process (suppressed) and ion transmembrane transport (activated) were among the BP exclusive to 1 month post-exposure. At 4 months, glycerolipid metabolism, pigmentation, and brown fat cell differentiation were suppressed. Table 2.

ORA is conducted by iteratively counting the number of genes shared between a preselected input gene set (e.g., genes differentially methylated based on cutoffs for significance and magnitude of change) and each annotated gene set (e.g., all genes in a GO category), and applying a hypergeometric test to determine the statistical significance of the overlap23. Since all the groups showed differential methylation in a sizable set of genes compared to differential expression, ORA was suitable for methylation whereas gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was more appropriate for gene expression as it does not require an arbitrary cutoff for selecting significant genes. All genes overlapping with at least one covered CpG site were used as the gene background for ORA. Using a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05 as the cutoff, nine processes were enriched in 4-month HLU + IR and included regulation of Wnt signaling, neurogenesis, nervous system development, cell projection organization, cell surface receptor signaling, pattern specification process and morphogenesis of a polarized epithelium. Genes with hypermethylation and involved in the regulation of these processes included oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as Wnt3, Trp53, Trp73, Sox10, Rap1gap, Paqr3, Kit and Bex1. The promoter region of the brain expressed X-linked gene, Bex1, contained four hypermethylated sites overlapping a CpG island. The gene has been reported to show promoter hypermethylation in malignant glioma cell line specimens24. Analysis based on KEGG pathways also showed an enrichment for Wnt signaling (raw and adjusted p-value of 0.005 and 0.3, respectively). Only one other group, 1-month HLU, showed over-representation for a biological process at an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 (actin filament-based process). Integrated analysis of genes and biological processes impacted at transcriptomic and epigenomic levels A total of 23 genes showed changes in expression and methylation at an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 (Table 3). Eef1a1, a protein involved in peptide chain elongation, was down-regulated and hypomethylated in groups exposed to radiation or microgravity 7 days post-exposure. Crystallin Crybb3 and signal-induced proliferation-associated Sipa1l3, both implicated in cataract, were up-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after exposure to IR or HLU, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgfr1) has been known to mediate photoreceptor rescue effect in response to retinal injury25, and the gene was up-regulated and hypomethylated 7 days after radiation. Ncor2, a gene in the Notch signaling pathway, was up-regulated with hypermethylation in the gene body in 7 days IR. Plectin Plec, a cytolinker protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, was up-regulated and hypermethylated. Filamin Flnb was also up-regulated and hypermethylated and is known to be involved in microvascular development26. No common differentially expressed and methylated genes were found in any of the exposure groups at 4 months. Table 3. Genes with statistically significant expression and methylation changes.

    "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight is an environment to which Earth-based biological systems have not yet adapted. Changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation both in terms of intensity and type, are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. It is crucial to characterize the impacts of these hazards to ensure the crew and NASA as an agency are appropriately informed. While hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated. Different countermeasure strategies will need to be employed if hazards modulate similar or divergent processes. It is important to note the current study leverages data from a previously performed animal study where mice were exposed to gamma-rays and microgravity as analogs of space radiation and microgravity respectively. However, even with the inherent limitations of using analogs, the observed results still provide insights on processes related to retinal dysfunction due to individual and combined exposures, at different time points, allowing us to gain a preliminary understanding of longitudinal changes. Compared to expression results from other tissue types collected in accompanying studies, spleen data from 7 days post-exposure showed highest number of DEG in HLU alone12, brain data from 4 months had most DEGs in HLU + IR6, whereas the retina results presented here showed DEGs peaked in IR alone at 7 days, and HLU + IR at 1 month. Combined stressors can induce complex responses further regulated by factors such as radiation type, post-exposure duration, and tissue type. Given the conflicting results from various studies addressing synergies between microgravity and radiation and their impact on DNA damage repair and cellular repair27, further work is needed to understand their interplay. Biological processes shared across, or exclusive to, exposure conditions and post-exposure stages were identified (Fig. 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table S5), and nucleotide metabolism was enriched in all the groups with activation at 1 month, suppression at 7 days and even lower at 4 months for all exposures. The suppression of nucleotide metabolism has been shown to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the stable growth arrest of oncogene-induced senescence28. Further work is required to understand the mechanism behind the activation at 1 month with a return to being suppressed at 4 months, and the specific role of Pdk1 in process modulation. Several genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7-days radiation only DEG (Cryaa, Cryba1, Cryba2, Cryba4, Crybb1, Crybb2, Crybb3, Crygs, Bsfp1) were enriched in nuclear and congenital cataracts, however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1 month or 4 months. A key component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, Map2k1, was down-regulated in the IR and HLU + IR groups at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month; MAPK signaling has been shown to be involved in AMD pathogenesis29. Bc1, a non-coding RNA known to affect vascular development14 and structural plasticity15 was significantly up-regulated in all three exposures at 1 month. Four months after radiation, retention of hypermethylation was observed in genes involved in eye development and pathogenesis including Myc-associated zinc-finger transcription factor Maz30, disintegrin Adamts5 involved in AMD, and Fscn2 with a role in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis. Interestingly, Adamts5 was previously observed to be dysregulated in the murine retina after spaceflight11. Additionally, early differential methylation (only at 7 days and 1 month) was observed in Hmgb3, a member of the high-mobility group superfamily and a transcription factor known to be impacted by spaceflight10. A total of 23 genes shared differential expression and methylation (Table 3). Of these, 14 had differential methylation in the promoter region and 9 in the gene body with negative correlation between expression and methylation changes in 3 and 6 genes, respectively. The rest showed a positive correlation. Recent studies have expanded the understanding of effects of DNA methylation on gene expression, especially in cancers31. Along with the traditional methylation-induced gene silencing, there have been patterns of consistently positive or negative correlations for all CpG sites associated with specific genes. More work is needed to understand the variation in the impact of DNA methylation on expression across different tissue and cell types, genes, and the location of CpG sites. High-mobility group containing Sox9 is known to be involved in retinogenesis32 and was up-regulated in 7-days HLU and IR groups, and hypomethylated in 7-days HLU. Ppm1a has been shown to play a crucial role in the wound healing-inflammation-angiogenesis axis in mice33, and was down-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after radiation but not later. Sphk1 plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory responses34; Sphkap, a modulator of Sphk1, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. The glycoprotein B4galt6 regulates astrocyte activation during CNS inflammation35 and was up-regulated and hypomethylated. Interestingly, Sphk1 and glycoproteins B4galt2 and B4galt3 were also up-regulated in 7 days HLU + IR based on spleen data from the same set of mice12. Transcriptional co-repressor Tle3, involved in Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. Biological processes related to Wnt signaling pathway were significantly enriched in multiple groups based on differential expression, with activation in IR and HLU + IR at 7 days, and suppression in 1-month HLU and all three exposures at 4 months. Wnt signaling pathway is critically involved in cell–cell communication and regulates tissue homeostasis36,37. Altered activities may promote tissue degeneration38. Wnt signaling plays a role in eye organogenesis32 and genes in the pathway have been reported to be impacted by spaceflight11. The pathway has also been shown to be affected by spaceflight in 3D-cultured neural stem cells39 and human cardiovascular progenitor cells40. Bclaf3 has been proposed to regulate proliferation/apoptosis by suppressing Wnt signaling in the mouse gastric epithelium41, and showed hypermethylation in the promoter within four of the groups including IR and HLU + IR at 4 months. Interestingly, genes involved in Wnt signaling also appeared as members in processes enriched in 4-months HLU + IR based on methylation data (Wnt3, Wnt11, Wnt7b, Lrp6, Tnik; Supplementary Table S6). Among the BP shared between differential methylation and expression (Table 4), pathways related to Wnt signaling were also over-represented in 4-months HLU + IR. Collagen fibril organization was over-represented with three overlapping constituent genes: Col5a1 encodes an alpha chain of type V collagen and the gene family forms a major component of the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium and related genes were altered in the mouse retina after spaceflight11, lysyl-oxidase like Loxl1 has been implicated in pseudoexfoliation syndrome which is a major cause of glaucoma and cardiovascular complications42, and Comp plays a role in vascular wall remodeling43. Actin filament-based process was enriched in 1-month HLU and 4-months HLU + IR. Some of the gene members based on differential methylation in 1-month HLU are also known to be involved in signaling by Rho GTPases (Rhoc, Rhobtb1, Arhgef10l, Cyfip2, Fmnl3, Fgd1, Iqgap3; Supplementary Table S6). Rho GTPases are key players in adaptation to microgravity and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in mammalian cells44,45. Temperature homeostasis was enriched in 7-days HLU, and has been shown to be impacted by hindlimb suspension in a previous study where the authors noted that unloading prevented the mice from curling up at night to regulate body temperature46. This difference in temperature regulation between the control and experimental groups should be considered while designing unloading experiments and interpreting the results. Interestingly, the NASA Twins Study reported Notch3 to show epigenetic discordance based on spaceflight blood samples13 and the gene was significantly up-regulated (twofold change) at 7 days post-irradiation in the mouse retina. Rbx1 and Ncor2, also in the Notch signaling pathway, showed 33% hypermethylation in 4-months HLU + IR, and up-regulation and hypermethylation 7 days post-irradiation, respectively. The NASA Twins Study also reports a decrease during flight in leucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, a protein involved in retinal vascular pathology. Lrg1 was down-regulated by more than fourfold (unadjusted p-value = 0.006) in 1-month HLU and significantly hypermethylated (16.8% methylation difference) in 4-months HLU + IR. This multi-omics murine analysis highlights changes in gene expression, DNA methylation, and regulation of biological processes exclusive to, or shared between, exposure groups at different timepoints. Furthermore, there were expressed genes and processes that only presented themselves at the 4-month time point, which may be indicative of a longer post-exposure duration to understand the effects of low-dose radiation and microgravity on the retina. Wnt signaling has been shown to be perturbed in the murine retina after spaceflight11 and our results show discordance in the pathway in the 4-months HLU + IR group based on changes in expression and methylation. Notch3 and Lrg1 showed discordance during flight in The NASA Twins Study blood samples13 and also exhibit differential patterns in the murine retina in the current study. Hence, despite limitations mentioned below, our study provides confidence that murine models can provide an understanding of molecular mechanisms and pathways contributing to ocular function as a response to analogs for spaceflight stressors. Our study comes with limitations. First, the number of samples was limited with only a total of 59 mice. Therefore, each exposure group at each time point was limited to 3–6 mice, thus limiting power. A follow-up study with more animals should be conducted to confirm these observations. Second, the animals were radiated by low-dose gamma rays which do not represent space radiation. Ground-based low-dose gamma or x-ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space-relevant radiation exposures (in terms of total dose) on different tissues/systems6,47,48 as to inform future space radiation experiments and form an initial understanding of the impacts across radiation doses and types. However, further studies should be implemented with higher dose gamma radiation and GCR simulations to leverage a more realistic space radiation analog. Third, a key limitation of applying bulk RNA-Seq and RRBS to a complex tissue such as the retina with ~ 140 cell types49 is that the approach averages signals over heterogeneous cell types at different transcriptomic states. As a result, true perturbations in, or correlation between, expression and methylation in a small cell population can be obscured by aggregated profiles. Fourth, caution is needed while comparing results between this study and The NASA Twins Study as biospecimen type and analysis time points differ between studies, and correlating time points across species with such different lifespans is challenging. Therefore, it is important to note that this analysis with its limitations only provides a preliminary signal for further investigation into understanding the longitudinal effect of spacelight hazard analogs on retina. Overall, the results of this study support the development of a more robust understanding of the longitudinal molecular mechanisms implicated in the murine retina response to low-dose gamma irradiation and simulated microgravity. Further investigation into the interplay between these mechanisms and validation of results in multiple models may provide insights into key pathways with translational potential across biological systems and exposure types as well as targets for mitigation strategies.",

Copyright notice ID: 9547011 PMID: 36207342 Abstract The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages. Subject terms: Retinal diseases, Epigenomics, TranscriptomicsIntroduction Spaceflight hazards such as microgravity and space radiation are anticipated to impact biological systems and could potentially affect crew health and performance both in mission and once astronauts return to Earth. These unique hazards have been thought to induce adverse changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with a frequently reported impact on ocular function1–4. Resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the International Space Station (ISS) are limited and it is difficult to recreate spaceflight conditions on the ground for controlled experiments. Therefore, characterization of the type and magnitude of these changes is challenging. Despite these challenges, analogs can be used to inform the understanding of the spaceflight environment impacts on biology and support development of mitigation strategies to reduce spaceflight health risks. Ground-based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, advances in bioinformatics have expanded the potential scientific return of prior experiments provided data is accessible for re-evaluation. Fortunately, NASA’s GeneLab is an open-access omics database for space-relevant biological experiments that provides access to uniformly formatted data5. The current study leverages transcriptomic and methylation sequencing data acquired as part of a larger experiment to understand the longitudinal effects and underlying mechanisms of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure and hindlimb unloading (HLU; an analog for microgravity) on neurovascular oxidative stress and brain function6. Global transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq quantifies gene expression at the time of sample acquisition while reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyzes DNA methylation, which is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications involved in disease development7–9. Previous studies analyzed spaceflight-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic response in murine retina10,11 or evaluated response to different ground-based hazard analogs in murine brain6 and spleen12. The spaceflight studies reported expression and methylation changes in genes known to be involved in visual perception, phototransduction, and macular degeneration pathways in murine models. However, these studies were performed in space where effects of both space radiation and microgravity on the retina were intertwined. In addition, these studies were performed 35–37 days after a spaceflight and there was no analysis done on longitudinal changes in the retina due to radiation or microgravity. To our knowledge, the current analysis is the first multi-omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We report differentially expressed genes (DEG), differentially methylated genes (DMG), and biological processes (BP) that are exclusive to, or shared across, multiple exposure conditions and post-exposure time points. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the NASA Twins Study13 and in the retina of mice flown to space11, with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure. This study provides an insight into the retinal response to exposures that are frequently used as analogs for individual spaceflight hazard and their interplay at different post-exposure stages, and contributes towards identifying key pathways to interrogate that may provide translational relevance across exposure types.Results Differential gene expression Post-exposure timepoints had different global expression patterns that were visible in principal component analysis where samples clustered more closely based on time point/age of mice instead of the exposure condition (Supplementary Fig. 1A). For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group (Supplementary Table S1) was compared to a control group (no radiation or HLU) with matched post-exposure duration, and significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons (Table 1, Fig. 1A,B). While the samples clustered by time point/age based on global gene expression, they could be separated by exposure condition within each time point when genes were selected based on differential expression (Supplementary Fig. 1B, Fig. 1B).

DEG differentially expressed genes, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation.The number of DEGs peaked at 7 days for groups exposed to only hindlimb unloading (HLU) or irradiation (IR) and showed a subsequent decline. The 275 DEG identified in 7-days IR were enriched in ocular disease terms (Supplementary Table S2) whereas the 71 DEG identified in HLU alone had no significant enrichment of disease pathways. In the 1-month IR group, 7 out of the 31 DEG showed > twofold change (down-regulated: Pon1, Sult1c1, Ermn, Stra6, Tmem72, Gm24514; up-regulated: Bc1). Stra6 and Pon1 are known to be involved in microphthalmia and diabetic retinopathy, respectively and Bc1 affects vascular development14 and structural plasticity15. Prss56, a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia16, was the only DEG at 4 months after exposure to IR alone. The highest number of DEG within HLU + IR (combination of hindlimb unloading and irradiation) was detected at 1 month post-exposure with no DEG at 7 days. The 64 DEG at 1 month included 20 genes with enrichment (adjusted p-value 8.24e-08) in the somatodendritic compartment of the neuron where synaptic inputs are received and integrated, and 15 genes known to be targets of mmu-miR-466, a miRNA that regulates age-related macular degeneration (AMD)17 (Supplementary Table S3). Overlapping differentially expressed genes across exposure groups Nine DEG were common between the HLU-only and IR-only groups at 7 days (down-regulated: Arl2bp, Chrna6, Egln1, Map2k1, Stmn2; up-regulated: Ccn2, Mbd6, Sox9, St6galnac2, Zfp36l1) (Fig. 1C). Bc1 and Pgk1 were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups at 1 month. Zinc finger protein Zc3h11a was significantly down-regulated in the HLU only group at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month. Zc3h11a expression has been shown to be altered in the murine retina and sclera in an experimental myopia mouse model18. Only a single common DEG was observed between the HLU + IR and HLU groups at 4 months (mt-Co2; up-regulated). mt-Co2 is in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is an essential subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain19. An integrated analysis of mammalian spaceflight data has reported the kidney to show an induction of mt-Co220.Differential DNA methylation The 1-month HLU + IR group showed the highest total number (957) of differentially methylated loci (DML) and regions (DMR) in known genes (Table 1, Fig. 2A). In all exposure groups, hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation. Among the hypermethylated loci, a higher proportion of methylation differences were associated with CpG shores than with islands except in all three exposures at 4 months (Fig. 2A). Conversely, more hypomethylated loci overlapped with CpG islands than with shores in most of the groups except in all three groups at 7 days. The exposure groups at 4 months contained a higher proportion of total DML within CpG islands than shores compared to the other time points. Top 1% DML (roughly equivalent to methylation difference ≥ 20%; Supplementary Fig. 2) within CpG islands and exclusive to 4 months post-exposure were found in 17 genes across HLU (hypo: Utp14a; hyper: Dlgap3), IR (hypo: Gm7855, Rtn4rl2; hyper: Maz, Shank3), and HLU + IR (hypo: Bag3; hyper: Aspdh, Map7d1, Map7d2, Morc4, Pcdh1, Pdzd11, Pik3ap1, Rtn4rl2, Suv39h1, Xk). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Differential methylation in exposure groups. (A) Total number of differentially methylated loci and regions within genes with hyper- or hypo-methylation in each exposure group categorized by whether they overlap with known CpG islands or shores. (B) Pairwise correlation plots for common differentially methylated sites. Differentially methylated loci (DML) with an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 were selected from each of the nine groups and pairwise correlation for methylation difference was plotted for any given pair. The diagonal shows distribution of methylation difference (%) between exposure and matched control group. Pearson correlation value and significance are displayed on the right of the diagonal, and scatter plots with methylation differences for common DML from any two given groups are displayed on the left. Only significant correlations (> 3 shared DML and p-value ≤ 0.05) are displayed. (C) Upset plot showing differentially methylated genes (DMG), defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML or DMR (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 10%), shared between at least two of the nine groups. The Y-axis represents the number of genes in a given intersection set. The X-axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set. Dots are colored by exposure condition (magenta for IR, green for HLU, orange for combination). R package MethylKit was used for differential methylation analysis, genomation and GenomicRanges were used for annotation of DML, and ggplot2, ggpairs and ComplexUpset were used for visualization. DML/R/G differentially methylated loci/region/gene, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation.Correlation in methylation differences across exposure groups Pairwise analysis of all methylated loci in genes were compared across our 9 exposure groups (Fig. 2B). The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post-exposure time point. Hypermethylation of Bclaf3 promoter was observed in four groups (~ 15% in 1m HLU, 4m IR and 4m HLU + IR, and 26% in 1m HLU + IR), and another CpG island in Tmc8 promoter was common across all three exposure groups at 7 days (10% hypermethylation). The top DMLs shared across all three exposures were in Cav2 at 7 days (30% hypermethylation), Grip2 at 1 month (20% hypermethylation), and Sorbs2 at 4 months (8% hypermethylation).Overlapping differentially methylated genes across exposure groups A number of genes containing DML or DMR were observed in multiple exposure groups and post-exposure time points (Fig. 2C). Bcl11b, Bclaf3, Gse1, Necab2, Plec and Tafa5 were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups. Six genes (Adamts5, Gse1, Rbm15b, Fscn2, Satb1, Tenm3) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure, with Adamts5 and Fscn2 promoters being hypermethylated even after 4 months of exposure to radiation alone. The promoter region of Pcdh19, a protocadherin, was hypermethylated (> 20% methylation difference) at all three time points for HLU + IR and also in HLU alone at 7 days. Bclaf3 was hypermethylated in five groups (HLU at 7 days and 1 month, HLU + IR at 1 month and 4 months, and IR and 4 months), and CpG islands in Hmgb3 promoter were hypermethylated in HLU and HLU + IR at both, 7 days and 1 month.Biological processes affected by low-dose radiation and hindlimb unloading across multiple conditions and post-exposure time points Shared and exclusive biological processes across exposures and time points based on differential expression The top BP significantly enriched across all conditions 7 days after exposure included morphogenesis of epithelium, ATP metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S4). Processes related to epithelial morphogenesis were activated in the exposure groups, whereas all other processes were suppressed across the three conditions. All shared processes were activated in the 1-month groups, with the exception of axon guidance and cell junction assembly, which were suppressed in the radiation only group. Common processes in the 1-month groups were related to amine transport, regulation of membrane potential, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and neurotransmitter transport. At 4 months post-exposure, the top processes shared across the three exposure conditions were suppressed. These included lens development in camera-type eye, wound healing, angiogenesis, and sulfur compound metabolic process. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Common biological processes enriched in different exposure groups and at different time points. (A) Top 20 significantly enriched BP common across all exposure conditions for a given time point. (B) Significantly enriched BP common across all time points for a given exposure condition. Size of each point represents magnitude of normalized enrichment score (NES) while the color indicates activation (red) or suppression (blue) of the BP in the given exposure group compared to time point-matched controls. The Y-axis provides a description of common GO BP and the X-axis lists the ratio of genes that belong to a given gene set to the total number of genes in the gene set. ClusterProfiler was used for gene set enrichment analysis and the R package ggplot2 was used for visualization. BP biological processes, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation, NES normalized enrichment score.Processes that were significantly enriched at all post-exposure time points for a given exposure condition were evaluated (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S4). Nucleotide metabolism was suppressed at 7 days and 4 months but activated at 1 month in mice subjected to microgravity alone, whereas epithelial tube morphogenesis and lens development were activated at 7 days but suppressed at all later time points, and detection of light stimulus was suppressed at 7 days and subsequently activated at 1 month and 4 months. Retina homeostasis was suppressed in the radiation only groups at 7 days and 1 month but activated at 4 months, eye morphogenesis was activated at 7 days and suppressed subsequently, and synaptic vesicle endocytosis was suppressed at 7 days but activated at all later time points. In the combination groups, postsynapse assembly was activated at all time points, nucleotide metabolism was activated only at 1 month, and Rho signal transduction was activated at 7 days and 1 month followed by suppression at 4 months. Nucleotide metabolism and related processes were significantly enriched in all nine groups with consistent activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Pdk1 was within the gene set for nucleotide metabolism processes across all nine groups, and its expression was decreased at 7 days and 4 months but increased at 1 month in all exposure groups (Supplementary Fig. 3). Pdk1 is a kinase known to play a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is involved in cellular response to hypoxia21. As a complementary approach to examining shared processes, BP exclusive to each exposure condition (enriched in ≥ 2 post-exposure time points), or exclusive to each post-exposure time point were also examined (Table 2, Supplementary Table S5). Processes related to microtubule dynamics were enriched exclusively in HLU alone. IR-specific BP included DNA conformation changes, Golgi organization, protein-DNA complex assembly, and type I interferon response. The BP activated exclusively in IR but not enriched in HLU + IR at 7 days included response to wounding, innate immune response, regulation of interleukin-6 production, heart morphogenesis, lipid metabolism, and epithelial cell proliferation. The processes suppressed exclusively in IR were related to telomere organization, DNA repair, ncRNA metabolism, detection of light stimulus, and organelle localization by membrane tethering. Lastly, BP exclusive to HLU + IR were postsynaptic density organization and regulation of AMPA receptors. Each post-exposure time point was associated with distinct BP enriched across multiple conditions only at the given time point. At 7 days, BP related to proteasomal protein catabolism were suppressed in all groups, and mammary gland morphogenesis was activated in IR and HLU + IR. Oncogenesis in the retina and breast have been linked by the regulation of cyclin D122; the gene encoding cyclin D1, Ccnd1, was significantly up-regulated 7 days after exposure to IR but was not differentially expressed at the later time points. mRNA catabolic process (suppressed) and ion transmembrane transport (activated) were among the BP exclusive to 1 month post-exposure. At 4 months, glycerolipid metabolism, pigmentation, and brown fat cell differentiation were suppressed. Table 2.

ORA is conducted by iteratively counting the number of genes shared between a preselected input gene set (e.g., genes differentially methylated based on cutoffs for significance and magnitude of change) and each annotated gene set (e.g., all genes in a GO category), and applying a hypergeometric test to determine the statistical significance of the overlap23. Since all the groups showed differential methylation in a sizable set of genes compared to differential expression, ORA was suitable for methylation whereas gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was more appropriate for gene expression as it does not require an arbitrary cutoff for selecting significant genes. All genes overlapping with at least one covered CpG site were used as the gene background for ORA. Using a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05 as the cutoff, nine processes were enriched in 4-month HLU + IR and included regulation of Wnt signaling, neurogenesis, nervous system development, cell projection organization, cell surface receptor signaling, pattern specification process and morphogenesis of a polarized epithelium. Genes with hypermethylation and involved in the regulation of these processes included oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as Wnt3, Trp53, Trp73, Sox10, Rap1gap, Paqr3, Kit and Bex1. The promoter region of the brain expressed X-linked gene, Bex1, contained four hypermethylated sites overlapping a CpG island. The gene has been reported to show promoter hypermethylation in malignant glioma cell line specimens24. Analysis based on KEGG pathways also showed an enrichment for Wnt signaling (raw and adjusted p-value of 0.005 and 0.3, respectively). Only one other group, 1-month HLU, showed over-representation for a biological process at an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 (actin filament-based process).Integrated analysis of genes and biological processes impacted at transcriptomic and epigenomic levels A total of 23 genes showed changes in expression and methylation at an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 (Table 3). Eef1a1, a protein involved in peptide chain elongation, was down-regulated and hypomethylated in groups exposed to radiation or microgravity 7 days post-exposure. Crystallin Crybb3 and signal-induced proliferation-associated Sipa1l3, both implicated in cataract, were up-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after exposure to IR or HLU, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgfr1) has been known to mediate photoreceptor rescue effect in response to retinal injury25, and the gene was up-regulated and hypomethylated 7 days after radiation. Ncor2, a gene in the Notch signaling pathway, was up-regulated with hypermethylation in the gene body in 7 days IR. Plectin Plec, a cytolinker protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, was up-regulated and hypermethylated. Filamin Flnb was also up-regulated and hypermethylated and is known to be involved in microvascular development26. No common differentially expressed and methylated genes were found in any of the exposure groups at 4 months. Table 3. Genes with statistically significant expression and methylation changes.

The highest number of overlapping processes were observed in 4-months HLU + IR, with Wnt signaling pathway being one of the shared BP. Actin filament-based process was enriched in 1-month HLU and 4-months HLU + IR based on both, differential expression and methylation. Processes related to ion transmembrane transport were activated in the 1-month HLU + IR group. Shared genes included ephrin Ephb2, which is also dysregulated in the murine brain following hindlimb unloading6. Calcium binding protein Cabp1 and calcium voltage-gated channel subunits Cacna1c and Cacna1h were among the genes involved in ion transport; another calcium voltage-gated channel subunit, Cacna2d4, was also impacted in the murine retina after spaceflight10.

BP biological process, HLU hindlimb unloading, IR irradiation.Discussion Spaceflight is an environment to which Earth-based biological systems have not yet adapted. Changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation both in terms of intensity and type, are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. It is crucial to characterize the impacts of these hazards to ensure the crew and NASA as an agency are appropriately informed. While hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated. Different countermeasure strategies will need to be employed if hazards modulate similar or divergent processes. It is important to note the current study leverages data from a previously performed animal study where mice were exposed to gamma-rays and microgravity as analogs of space radiation and microgravity respectively. However, even with the inherent limitations of using analogs, the observed results still provide insights on processes related to retinal dysfunction due to individual and combined exposures, at different time points, allowing us to gain a preliminary understanding of longitudinal changes. Compared to expression results from other tissue types collected in accompanying studies, spleen data from 7 days post-exposure showed highest number of DEG in HLU alone12, brain data from 4 months had most DEGs in HLU + IR6, whereas the retina results presented here showed DEGs peaked in IR alone at 7 days, and HLU + IR at 1 month. Combined stressors can induce complex responses further regulated by factors such as radiation type, post-exposure duration, and tissue type. Given the conflicting results from various studies addressing synergies between microgravity and radiation and their impact on DNA damage repair and cellular repair27, further work is needed to understand their interplay. Biological processes shared across, or exclusive to, exposure conditions and post-exposure stages were identified (Fig. 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table S5), and nucleotide metabolism was enriched in all the groups with activation at 1 month, suppression at 7 days and even lower at 4 months for all exposures. The suppression of nucleotide metabolism has been shown to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the stable growth arrest of oncogene-induced senescence28. Further work is required to understand the mechanism behind the activation at 1 month with a return to being suppressed at 4 months, and the specific role of Pdk1 in process modulation. Several genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7-days radiation only DEG (Cryaa, Cryba1, Cryba2, Cryba4, Crybb1, Crybb2, Crybb3, Crygs, Bsfp1) were enriched in nuclear and congenital cataracts, however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1 month or 4 months. A key component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, Map2k1, was down-regulated in the IR and HLU + IR groups at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month; MAPK signaling has been shown to be involved in AMD pathogenesis29. Bc1, a non-coding RNA known to affect vascular development14 and structural plasticity15 was significantly up-regulated in all three exposures at 1 month. Four months after radiation, retention of hypermethylation was observed in genes involved in eye development and pathogenesis including Myc-associated zinc-finger transcription factor Maz30, disintegrin Adamts5 involved in AMD, and Fscn2 with a role in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis. Interestingly, Adamts5 was previously observed to be dysregulated in the murine retina after spaceflight11. Additionally, early differential methylation (only at 7 days and 1 month) was observed in Hmgb3, a member of the high-mobility group superfamily and a transcription factor known to be impacted by spaceflight10. A total of 23 genes shared differential expression and methylation (Table 3). Of these, 14 had differential methylation in the promoter region and 9 in the gene body with negative correlation between expression and methylation changes in 3 and 6 genes, respectively. The rest showed a positive correlation. Recent studies have expanded the understanding of effects of DNA methylation on gene expression, especially in cancers31. Along with the traditional methylation-induced gene silencing, there have been patterns of consistently positive or negative correlations for all CpG sites associated with specific genes. More work is needed to understand the variation in the impact of DNA methylation on expression across different tissue and cell types, genes, and the location of CpG sites. High-mobility group containing Sox9 is known to be involved in retinogenesis32 and was up-regulated in 7-days HLU and IR groups, and hypomethylated in 7-days HLU. Ppm1a has been shown to play a crucial role in the wound healing-inflammation-angiogenesis axis in mice33, and was down-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after radiation but not later. Sphk1 plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory responses34; Sphkap, a modulator of Sphk1, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. The glycoprotein B4galt6 regulates astrocyte activation during CNS inflammation35 and was up-regulated and hypomethylated. Interestingly, Sphk1 and glycoproteins B4galt2 and B4galt3 were also up-regulated in 7 days HLU + IR based on spleen data from the same set of mice12. Transcriptional co-repressor Tle3, involved in Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. Biological processes related to Wnt signaling pathway were significantly enriched in multiple groups based on differential expression, with activation in IR and HLU + IR at 7 days, and suppression in 1-month HLU and all three exposures at 4 months. Wnt signaling pathway is critically involved in cell–cell communication and regulates tissue homeostasis36,37. Altered activities may promote tissue degeneration38. Wnt signaling plays a role in eye organogenesis32 and genes in the pathway have been reported to be impacted by spaceflight11. The pathway has also been shown to be affected by spaceflight in 3D-cultured neural stem cells39 and human cardiovascular progenitor cells40. Bclaf3 has been proposed to regulate proliferation/apoptosis by suppressing Wnt signaling in the mouse gastric epithelium41, and showed hypermethylation in the promoter within four of the groups including IR and HLU + IR at 4 months. Interestingly, genes involved in Wnt signaling also appeared as members in processes enriched in 4-months HLU + IR based on methylation data (Wnt3, Wnt11, Wnt7b, Lrp6, Tnik; Supplementary Table S6). Among the BP shared between differential methylation and expression (Table 4), pathways related to Wnt signaling were also over-represented in 4-months HLU + IR. Collagen fibril organization was over-represented with three overlapping constituent genes: Col5a1 encodes an alpha chain of type V collagen and the gene family forms a major component of the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium and related genes were altered in the mouse retina after spaceflight11, lysyl-oxidase like Loxl1 has been implicated in pseudoexfoliation syndrome which is a major cause of glaucoma and cardiovascular complications42, and Comp plays a role in vascular wall remodeling43. Actin filament-based process was enriched in 1-month HLU and 4-months HLU + IR. Some of the gene members based on differential methylation in 1-month HLU are also known to be involved in signaling by Rho GTPases (Rhoc, Rhobtb1, Arhgef10l, Cyfip2, Fmnl3, Fgd1, Iqgap3; Supplementary Table S6). Rho GTPases are key players in adaptation to microgravity and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in mammalian cells44,45. Temperature homeostasis was enriched in 7-days HLU, and has been shown to be impacted by hindlimb suspension in a previous study where the authors noted that unloading prevented the mice from curling up at night to regulate body temperature46. This difference in temperature regulation between the control and experimental groups should be considered while designing unloading experiments and interpreting the results. Interestingly, the NASA Twins Study reported Notch3 to show epigenetic discordance based on spaceflight blood samples13 and the gene was significantly up-regulated (twofold change) at 7 days post-irradiation in the mouse retina. Rbx1 and Ncor2, also in the Notch signaling pathway, showed 33% hypermethylation in 4-months HLU + IR, and up-regulation and hypermethylation 7 days post-irradiation, respectively. The NASA Twins Study also reports a decrease during flight in leucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, a protein involved in retinal vascular pathology. Lrg1 was down-regulated by more than fourfold (unadjusted p-value = 0.006) in 1-month HLU and significantly hypermethylated (16.8% methylation difference) in 4-months HLU + IR. This multi-omics murine analysis highlights changes in gene expression, DNA methylation, and regulation of biological processes exclusive to, or shared between, exposure groups at different timepoints. Furthermore, there were expressed genes and processes that only presented themselves at the 4-month time point, which may be indicative of a longer post-exposure duration to understand the effects of low-dose radiation and microgravity on the retina. Wnt signaling has been shown to be perturbed in the murine retina after spaceflight11 and our results show discordance in the pathway in the 4-months HLU + IR group based on changes in expression and methylation. Notch3 and Lrg1 showed discordance during flight in The NASA Twins Study blood samples13 and also exhibit differential patterns in the murine retina in the current study. Hence, despite limitations mentioned below, our study provides confidence that murine models can provide an understanding of molecular mechanisms and pathways contributing to ocular function as a response to analogs for spaceflight stressors. Our study comes with limitations. First, the number of samples was limited with only a total of 59 mice. Therefore, each exposure group at each time point was limited to 3–6 mice, thus limiting power. A follow-up study with more animals should be conducted to confirm these observations. Second, the animals were radiated by low-dose gamma rays which do not represent space radiation. Ground-based low-dose gamma or x-ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space-relevant radiation exposures (in terms of total dose) on different tissues/systems6,47,48 as to inform future space radiation experiments and form an initial understanding of the impacts across radiation doses and types. However, further studies should be implemented with higher dose gamma radiation and GCR simulations to leverage a more realistic space radiation analog. Third, a key limitation of applying bulk RNA-Seq and RRBS to a complex tissue such as the retina with ~ 140 cell types49 is that the approach averages signals over heterogeneous cell types at different transcriptomic states. As a result, true perturbations in, or correlation between, expression and methylation in a small cell population can be obscured by aggregated profiles. Fourth, caution is needed while comparing results between this study and The NASA Twins Study as biospecimen type and analysis time points differ between studies, and correlating time points across species with such different lifespans is challenging. Therefore, it is important to note that this analysis with its limitations only provides a preliminary signal for further investigation into understanding the longitudinal effect of spacelight hazard analogs on retina. Overall, the results of this study support the development of a more robust understanding of the longitudinal molecular mechanisms implicated in the murine retina response to low-dose gamma irradiation and simulated microgravity. Further investigation into the interplay between these mechanisms and validation of results in multiple models may provide insights into key pathways with translational potential across biological systems and exposure types as well as targets for mitigation strategies.Methods Experimental conditions The original study was conducted at Loma Linda University following recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals50 and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). A detailed description of the experimental setup has been published previously51. Briefly, a total of 59 six-month-old, female C57BL/6 J mice were housed in cages of same dimensions and subjected to one of four experimental conditions: sham control with no radiation or unloading (N = 15), hindlimb unloading (N = 14), low-dose irradiation (N = 15), and a combination of hindlimb unloading and low-dose irradiation (N = 15) for 21 days (Supplementary Table 1). Hindlimb suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Gamma radiation was delivered using 57Co plates placed underneath the cages and a dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h was used to deliver a total dose of 0.04 Gy over a period of 21 days to simulate a space radiation environment. For the combination group, mice were exposed to unloading and simultaneously irradiated by 57Co plate placed underneath the cages. Mice from each exposure condition were then allowed a post-exposure period of 7 days, 1 month, or 4 months, following which mice were euthanized and retinas were collected and frozen. RNA and DNA libraries were constructed and used for RNA-Seq and RRBS. The resulting data was deposited to GeneLab where RNA-seq output was processed per NASA GeneLab RNA-seq pipeline52, and RRBS results are available in the form of raw sequencing reads. Unnormalized RNA-seq counts and raw RRBS FastQ files were downloaded from GeneLab and used for the current analysis.Differential gene expression analysis Unnormalized RNA-seq counts were downloaded from GeneLab. Out of a total of 59 samples (Supplementary Table S1), three were excluded from expression analysis due to low RNA integrity number values or high ribosomal RNA contamination. These counts were generated with GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline, which includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps. Full details of the pipeline including the parameters used for each individual tool have been previously published52. RNA-seq counts were subsequently analyzed with DESeq2 (v1.30.1)53 where counts were first normalized using the median-of-ratios method followed by differential gene expression analysis comparing each experimental group to the corresponding post-exposure time point-matched control group. Differentially expressed genes were determined using cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 for log2(fold-change) and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value, respectively, to be consistent with analyses of brain and spleen tissues from the same set of mice6,12. R packages ggplot254, ComplexHeatmap55 and pheatmap56 were used for visualization and generating heatmaps.Differential methylation analysis Raw RRBS reads were downloaded from GeneLab and processed with nf-core/methylseq pipeline (https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq; v1.6.1 accessed on June 23rd, 2021). In short, FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) was used for running quality checks on reads, adapter sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! for Cutadapt57 without the –rrbs option as recommended for NuGEN RRBS Ovation kit, NuGEN’s diversity trimming script was run, and Bismark58 was used for alignment and methylation call extraction. Deduplication based on overlapping coordinates was skipped as it is not recommended for RRBS59. Two samples were excluded from methylation analysis due to GC content bias. Mean Phred quality score across each base position in the read was confirmed to be ≥ 20 (Supplementary Fig. 4), and MethylKit (v1.16.1)60 was used for detection of differentially methylated loci with a cutoff of 0.05 and 10% for a sliding linear model adjusted p-value61 and magnitude of methylation difference, respectively11. As a complementary approach, methylation differences were also calculated over 100-bp tiling windows to obtain differentially methylated regions60. Sites and regions were mapped to known genes (mm10 assembly) and known CpG islands using genomation62 and GenomicRanges63 packages. Promoter regions were defined as 2 kbp upstream and downstream of annotated transcription start sites. Differentially methylated genes were defined as genes containing at least one DML or DMR within their promoter region or gene body. For determination of overlap between differential expression and methylation, no thresholds for fold-change or methylation difference were used to allow for genes with modest, but still significant (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), changes to be observed.Gene set enrichment and over-representation analyses GSEA for gene expression and over-representation analysis for methylation were conducted with the ClusterProfiler (v3.18,1) package64 against the biological process GO category using gseGO and enrichGO functions, and against KEGG pathways using enrichKEGG. Wald test statistics from DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis were used to rank genes for enrichment analysis. Appropriate background gene lists were created by selecting all genes expressed in the retina or covered by at least one CpG site (within ± 2 kb of the gene) for expression (GSEA) and methylation (ORA) data, respectively. A Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 was used for selecting enriched terms. REVIGO65 was used for reducing significant biological processes to a representative non-redundant set of terms. ORA was performed separately on hypo and hypermethylated genes to obtain significantly enriched GO biological processes (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) based on differential methylation in each group. Following adjustments were made to GSEA and ORA to allow for the discovery of overlapping candidate processes and genes between expression and methylation that can be further validated: (a) differentially methylated genes were defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 10%) or DMR (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 2%); regulated methylation targets are routinely clustered into short genomic regions66 and a lower threshold for methylation difference in DMR (2%) is recommended for enrichment analysis since perturbed processes can be a cumulative effect of multiple DMR with small effects67, and (b) an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.25 was used for detecting overlapping biological processes based on differential methylation and expression; GSEA guidelines recommend a 25% false discovery rate (FDR) for exploratory analyses as a more stringent threshold can exclude significant results even before they can be validated68. Enrichr69 and ToppGene70 were used for disease term and functional enrichment analysis.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information 1. (529.9KB, docx) Supplementary Information 2.

    "title": "Evidence of spaceflight-induced adverse effects on photoreceptors and retinal function in the mouse eye.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment. Keywords: spaceflight, retina, photoreceptor, oxidative stress, antioxidant",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been identified in astronauts. These complex physiological and pathological changes are collectively defined as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. The condition can lead to long-term effects, including changes in visual acuity, even after the astronauts have returned to Earth. The underlying mechanisms of the changes and functional outcomes of observed ocular change remain poorly understood. An increase in oxidative stress in the retina and photoreceptors is thought to be a key factor in the development of retinal disease [2]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to damage of the critical cell populations and tissue remodeling. Previous studies have revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for the oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), in the retina, following space radiation exposure [3] and spaceflight [4]. Because environmental, radiotherapy, and pathological conditions can induce the production of a high level of unstable oxygen species, efforts have been made to develop drugs with therapeutic potential. However, practical application has been somewhat disappointing due to complications such as short half-lives, low reaction rate constants, lack of cellular uptake, and hypersensitivity reactions [5]. Metal-containing catalytic antioxidants have emerged as especially promising. Of these, redox-active metalloporphyrins possess distinct antioxidant properties, including scavenging O2−, H2O2, and lipid peroxides that mediate cellular and tissue damage [6]. These compounds have proven efficacious in numerous in vivo animal models of disease in reducing oxidative stress [7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, in previous studies, we documented the protective effects of a redox-active metalloporphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) to both photoreceptors and retinal capillaries from radiation damage [11,12]. Butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin–MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, (BuOE), is a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, that is also termed BMX-001, and is currently in multiple phase 1 and phase 2 human clinical trials. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ has shown protective effects against radiation-induced damage to the brain white matter and hippocampal neurogenesis [13,14]. Our previous flight data showed a significant increase in apoptotic damage in the photoreceptors of flight mice compared to ground controls [4]. However, the pathophysiological consequences of cellular damage on photoreceptor and retinal function have not been well investigated. In the present study, mice were flown on SpX-24 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days to characterize the space environment-induced oxidative damage on ocular structure and retinal function using histochemistry, intraocular pressure (IOP), and electroretinography (ERG). The antioxidant effects of BuOE in mitigating spaceflight condition-induced retinal damage were evaluated.",
    "methods": "4. Material and Methods 4.1. Spaceflight and Mouse Groups Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days aboard the ISS. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle during the flight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. The flight mice were subdivided into two groups: a saline control or BuOE-treated group. BuOE at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. After returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, it took approximately 20 h for the mice to be recovered in the Atlantic Ocean, brought to shore, and transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida. Upon live return, a subset of mice (8 per group) went through IOP and ERG testing. The rest of the spaceflight mice (5 per group) were then euthanized with intraperitoneal (IP) injections of Ketamine/Xylazine (up to 150 mg/kg Ketamine combined with up to 45 mg/kg Xylazine). Their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Ground control mice were placed into the same housing hardware with environmental parameters used in flight. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on 14 October 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp Institute IACUC on 7 October 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18), and Loma Linda University Health IACUC on 8 February 2022 (Protocol Number: 8170051). The activities involving vertebrate animals were conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.2. IOP Measurement IOP in conscious animals was measured pre-launch and post-flight before euthanization with a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC, USA). The animals exhibited no signs of discomfort during the procedure. Five to six sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse [56]. 4.3. ERG To measure photoreceptor function, ERG was recorded using a Micron® Ganzfeld ERG system (Phoenix-Micron, Inc., Bend, OR, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were dark-adapted for at least 3 h prior to obtaining ERG recordings which were performed on the right eyes. Mice were maintained under anesthesia with 1.5–2% Isoflurane through a nose cone and placed on a heated stage during testing to prevent hypothermia throughout the procedure. The pupils were dilated with 1–2 drops of 0.5% tropicamide (Akorn, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Paragon BioTeck, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) ophthalmic solutions. Hypromellose (Gonak™) ophthalmic demulcent solution (2.5%) (Akorn, Inc.) was topically administered to the eyes for proper contact with the corneal electrode. The Ganzfeld optical head includes three LEDs with 360, 504, and 850 nm wavelengths. It illuminates the eye with near-infrared at 850 nm during alignment of the corneal electrode guided by the Eye-Cockpit ( IDS uEye software version 4.3, IDS Imaging Development Systems Inc., Minato City, Tokyo) camera software. Three electrodes were attached to record the transretinal electrical signals: the Ganzfeld corneal (positive) electrode was made of a gold conducting ring around the objective lens, contact-attached to the cornea, sealing the eye. A reference (negative) electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the head skin positioned midline between the ears, such that the end of the needle was between the eyes. Finally, a ground electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the base of the tail. ERG was recorded according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following signal baseline stabilization, ERG signals were recorded in response to increasing intensities of 360 nm Ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes (1 ms duration). Ganzfeld uses a Maxwellian view of illumination, which projects single light to the eye pupil illuminating the retina with high divergence. For each mouse, five sweeps of electrical responses were acquired at each intensity flash, with varying stimulus intervals (Table 1). The waveform amplitudes (microvolts) and implicit times (seconds) of a- and b-waves at each flash stimulus were acquired from five averaged sweeps and analyzed using the Labscribe software (LabScribeERG version 3.016800, iWorx systems, Dover, NH, USA). The amplitude of the a-wave represents the photoreceptor layer hyperpolarization (negative) signal and the b-wave represents the inner retinal bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization (positive) response signal. Data obtained from all mice were averaged to represent the mean ± standard error (SEM) of a-wave and b-wave amplitudes. Table 1.

TUNEL Assay Six μm sections were cut through each left eye for analysis. Five ocular sections, roughly 100 μm apart, were evaluated using the TUNEL assay to identify and quantify apoptotic cells, according to standard procedures. Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (1:100, catalog no. DL-1177, Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). 4.5. IHC Staining Six µm paraffin-embedded section of the left eye from 5 mice per group, roughly 100 μm apart, were used for analysis. To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (catalog no. FL-1071, Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature, for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18–21 h) at 4 °C with rabbit primary anti-4-HNE antibody (1:1000, catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX, USA). After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog no. A11011, Life Technologies Corp., Eugene, OR, USA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and were mounted and cover-slipped with Vectashield Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (catalog no. H-1700, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). 4.6. Quantification of Immunostaining Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination at 20X magnification, spanning the entire retina per section. For quantitative analysis, the total numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted. For cone density, numbers of PNA-positive cells were counted within the entire nuclear layer of the field image. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using the ImageJ v1.4 software. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retinal sections that were 100 μm apart per eye was used as a single experimental value. The density profiles were expressed as the mean number of apoptotic cells or cone cells/mm2 for 5 samples of each group. To quantify HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6–10 randomly selected fields and calculated using the Image J software. The data were extracted and averaged within the group. 4.7. Statistical Analysis We tested the normality of data distribution for IOP, ERG, 4-HNE, PNA, and TUNEL assays using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The data were then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons. The means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. α-level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance.",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. Body Weight Mice were weighed before launch and shortly before being euthanized after landing. Prior to taking off, the body weights were similar among all groups. The flight (FLT) and habitat ground control (GC) groups weighed between 25 and 27 g. The body mass after landing, for both the saline control and BuOE-treated FLT mice, was not significantly different compared to that of pre-flight measurements. However, body weights for the age-matched GC groups were significantly (p < 0.05) increased following the flight compared to pre-flight measurements (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Each bar represents the mean ± SEM for mice in each group. * Significantly higher than pre-flight measurements (p < 0.05). 2.2. IOP Measurement IOP was measured from a randomly selected left or right eye of each mouse before launch and shortly after landing. The post-flight saline and BuOE-treated FLT groups showed a decreasing trend in IOP, compared to pre-flight measurements, but there were no statistical differences with 11.4 and 10.2 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight saline group, and 11.3 and 10.3 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight BuOE-treated groups, respectively. The measurements for the flight groups were similar to that of the GC groups (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Each bar represents the mean counts from the left or right eyes of pre- and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice (n = 8). Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Values are the means ± SEM. 2.3. ERG Assessment of Retinal Function To assess the mouse retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the ERG a-wave, which is generated by the activation of photoreceptors, a measure of photoreceptor function, and b-wave, which is primarily generated by the ON-type bipolar cell neurons [15]. Representative ERG waveforms for FLT saline vs. GC saline and FLT saline vs. FLT BuOE-treated groups were compared in Figure 3a,b. The figures illustrate average a- and b-wave amplitude measurements in response to the strongest flash, with stimulus energies of log 2.5 cd·s/m2 over implicit time. The amplitudes for a- and b-waves for the flight groups were reduced when compared to controls. The waveforms were similar between post-flight saline and BuOE-treated groups. The longitudinal changes of amplitude and implicit time (time-to-peak) for a- and b-waves with increased flash intensities for pre- and post-flight FLT and GC groups were presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Differences in amplitude and implicit time to light stimulation were noted in the FLT group following the spaceflight when they were compared to pre-flight measurements or the GC group. Reduced amplitudes and delayed peak time observed in the FLT group may indicate low sensitivity of cone cells in response to stimulus flash. Figure 3.

The response is similar between pre- and post-GC measurements.When compared to pre-flight, the amplitude of the a- and b-wave that reflected an average response to all flash intensities in the post-flight group was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for both saline and BuOE-treated groups (Figure 6a,c), while the amplitude of a- and b-waves for pre- and post-flight in the GC group was similar (Figure 6b,d). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pre- and post-flight comparison of the average response to the light sensitivity of the retina to the a- and b-wave in saline and BuOE-treated (FLT) and habitat control (GC) groups.

The amplitude of the a-wave in the BuOE-treated group was close to the GC controls. Our ERG data also showed that the average amplitude of the b-wave that elicited a light-invoked slow cornea-positive potential was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 39% and 25% in FLT saline or BuOE-treated mice compared to their habitat ground control counterparts, respectively (Figure 8).

Apoptosis in the Retina Apoptosis in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (ECs) was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end label (TUNEL) staining. Apoptotic cells labeled with green fluorescence (Figure 9a) were mostly detected in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina of the flight saline group was 67% higher than GC controls, with a strong trend difference (p = 0.056) (Figure 9b). The counts for apoptosis were similar between the BuOE-treated and saline flight groups. The data demonstrate that spaceflight conditions induce retinal apoptosis. The retinal ECs showed a similar level of apoptosis across all groups (Figure 9c). Figure 9.

(a) TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence and the endothelium was stained with lectin in red. TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 50 μm. (b) Apoptotic cell density in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the FLT and the GC mice.

Strong trend differences between FLT saline vs. GC saline (p = 0.058), and FLT BuOE vs. GC BuOE (p = 0.056). 2.5. Oxidative Damage in the Photoreceptor The 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) marker for oxidative damage was evaluated in the retina. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL in the spaceflight group compared to all other groups (Figure 10a). As shown in Figure 10b, the fluorescent intensity of 4-HNE in the photoreceptor cones of the flight group mice was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to both the ground controls and the BuOE-treated flight group. The immunoactivity of HNE immunoreactivity in BuOE-treated FLT retina was similar to saline or BuOE-treated GC groups. Figure 10.

There were no significant differences in the cone density between the flight saline and BuOE groups.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Observed changes following spaceflight include increased oxidative damage and increased apoptosis in the mouse retinal nuclear layer and photoreceptors. ERG data, for the first time, demonstrated that spaceflight evoked changes in photoreceptor function in a mouse model. The average amplitudes of a- and b-waves for the flight group were significantly reduced when compared to controls. Our results show that FLT mice did not gain weight after the flight as was observed for the age-matched GC group. Other spaceflight studies reported a loss in body mass after spaceflight [16,17]. It has been proposed that the lack of increase in body mass may be related to mixed factors, including dehydration, stress, altered glucose, and lipid metabolism, or less food consumption [18,19]. Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for the development and progression of many ocular diseases, especially glaucoma [20]. IOP and intracranial pressure (ICP) changes are suspected to be involved in the ocular anatomical changes and visual function impairment exhibited by some astronauts [21]. Results from head–down bed-rest studies, which simulate the microgravity effects, have shown IOP and ocular blood flow changes. These changes are implicated in the pathophysiology of optic disk edema [22]. For our study, within 20 h of splashdown, we measured the IOP of flight and control groups in fully conscious mice. The data were consistent with previous observations and showed no significant differences between pre- and post-flight groups, or between flight and control groups. This indicates that a 35-day space mission may have a limited impact on irreversible IOP changes pathologically. One possible explanation is that IOP is a transient and time-sensitive parameter. Changes can happen within seconds to minutes. Due to logistical limitations, we were unable to measure IOP until 20 h after splashdown, and elevations in this readout may not have been detectable. Studies have shown that IOP fluctuates considerably with time, body postural change, venous pressure changes, and stress levels [23]. Further evaluation of IOP during spaceflight or longer time sustained microgravity conditions will be required. The ERG is an electrical potential generated in response to light stimulation of the retina and recorded from the corneal surface of the eye. ERG technology is a powerful approach in assessing retina function [24] and ganglion cell activity [25]. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin) [26], whereby the S-cones are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) peak at 360 nm, and M-cones and rods are responsive to the green light at peak 504 nm. Previous studies suggested that the mouse cone system predominantly expresses S-opsin [27]. Since S-opsin sensitivity drops significantly at wavelengths longer than 425 nm, only UV light is efficient in stimulating mouse S-opsin [27]. In our present study, we focused on probing S-cone-mediated properties using UV light stimulation. Despite the small percentage of cones in the mouse photoreceptor (5%) [28], cone-mediated responses in mouse ganglion cells are fast and sensitive. Our measurement enables us to quantify cone-mediated response and correlate this with histochemistry evaluation. Cone bipolar pathways are similar to those found in mammals [29]. Therefore, the mouse is potentially a useful model to study cone-mediated vision and for diseases that affects the cone function in humans [27,29]. The two ERG components that are most often measured are the a- and b-waves. The a-wave is the first large negative component that reflects the physiological status of photoreceptor rods and cones, followed by the b-wave, which is a cornea-positive amplitude. The b-wave reflects the health of the inner layers of the retina, including the ON bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization in response to increases in light stimulation [15]. Reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes documented in the flight group indicate retinal photoreceptor damage and disturbance of retinal physiological function. These changes are associated with the observed increase in apoptosis in the inner nuclear ganglion cell layer, and a decrease in cone density following spaceflight. Abnormal ERG is recognized in many ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and cone dystrophy [15,30,31]. Most human retina disorders are detected by attenuation of amplitude [25]. Studies have also shown a correlation between a decrease in cone-driven function through reductions of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes and cone photoreceptor loss in a light damage model [32]. Our ERG and histological findings, for the first time, show that spaceflight-induced retinal functional change may occur as a result of photoreceptor damage and cellular death. It is important to characterize and monitor retinal changes that may lead to the progression of retinal disease and retinal degeneration. Retinal neurons include amacrine, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. Radiation-induced photoreceptor loss has been shown in a previous study with 1 Gy of iron-56 irradiation [33]. Studies from the Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) and Rodent Study-9 (RR-9) also showed a significant increase in apoptotic cell damage in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and INL of the flight mice photoreceptors [34,35]. Retinal nuclear cell damage causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases [36]. Retinas are more sensitive to environmental damage than other central nervous system (CNS) neurons [37]. Apoptotic cell death is documented in many forms of retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration [38]. These findings suggest that retinal nuclear and photoreceptor cells play an important role in maintaining the normal structure and function of the retina. Our data revealed significant increases in retinal nuclear/photoreceptor cell death and a trend showing a decrease in cone density by spaceflight. The presence of apoptotic positive cells in this study supports the hypothesis that apoptotic mechanisms are involved in retinal cell death. Further studies will be required to determine whether these effects are reversible or continue to deteriorate over time. Oxidative stress-induced ocular tissue damage has been associated with a variety of pathological conditions [2,39,40]. Oxidative stress is one of the leading causes of retinal damage and retinal degenerative diseases [41]. Radiation-induced oxidative stress can damage critical cellular structure and biomolecules [42], resulting in inflammatory responses, cell death, and tissue remodeling [43,44]. We have shown in our previous studies that spaceflight and space radiation exposures cause oxidative changes in the retina and retinal vasculature [34,45,46]. HNE is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress [47]. This flight study documented increased oxidative damage with 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL [4]. The correlation between increased oxidative damage in photoreceptors and abnormal ERG recording indicates that spaceflight impacts the retinal structure, physiology and function. In future studies, we will determine if these observed changes will persist or reverse with a longer re-adaption period. The safety of BuOE has been evaluated in a battery of nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant studies. Systemic toxicity has been evaluated using the intended cGMP product administered subcutaneously for periods of up to 5 weeks in both mouse and the monkey, and have included toxicokinetic evaluations to characterize systemic exposure, tissue distribution, and clearance of BuOE [48]. Redox-active metalloporphyrin antioxidants have been shown to be effective in protecting against radiation-induced ocular damage [11]. In the present study, with the current injection dose, our results showed that BuOE is safe. Body weights among saline- or BuOE-treated ground control groups were similar and no overt sign of toxicity related to this compound was observed. Immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker, HNE, was significantly reduced in the BuOE-treated flight group compared to the flight saline group. This suggests that BuOE was effective in reducing reactive oxygen species that activate retinal stress responses during space flight [49,50]. Metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants are potent detoxifiers of lipid peroxides and lipoperoxyl radicals, a process that is mediated via hydroxyl radicals [6,51]. Our present study suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing mechanism for observed damage in the retina and photoreceptor, which was demonstrated by increased 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation. Adding BuOE, a lipophilic metalloporphyrin compound with high potency for the catalysis of lipid peroxidation reduced immunoreactivity of the biomarker in the BuOE-treated ocular tissue compared to the flight saline group, suggesting a potential mechanism of oxidative stress in inducing cellular damage. However, BuOE was found to only slightly mitigate spaceflight-induced apoptosis in retinal photoreceptor or endothelial cells, suggesting that apoptosis was not inhibited. Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceflight-induced retinal functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high flash intensity (Figure 3b). It may be that the beneficial or protective effects of BuOE with the current dosage was not sufficient to significantly ameliorate the harmful spaceflight-induced effects on the retina or that alternative stressors may be directly leading to apoptosis despite reduced oxidative stress. Due to logistic limitations, the compound was injected once a week in orbit. More frequent injections may be required to protect retinal function more effectively. Daily [52,53] or twice-weekly [54] administration schedules have been reported to have significant protective effects from oxidative damage in other disease models. Free radicals produced in the ocular tissues by the mechanism other than ROS, which include reactive nitrogen species, and reactive carbonyl species [55], may be equally important in inducing cellular damage in the retina. Another plausible explanation is that spaceflight conditions induced an imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal function at a later time. We plan to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptotic status, and retinal function parameters at three months following live animal return to Earth, to further assess the ocular tissue re-adaptation process. It is anticipated that a redox-active metalloporphyrin can be effective in protecting against spaceflight-induced retinal damage.",

Copyright notice ID: 10138634 PMID: 37108526 Abstract The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment. Keywords: spaceflight, retina, photoreceptor, oxidative stress, antioxidant1. Introduction Neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been identified in astronauts. These complex physiological and pathological changes are collectively defined as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. The condition can lead to long-term effects, including changes in visual acuity, even after the astronauts have returned to Earth. The underlying mechanisms of the changes and functional outcomes of observed ocular change remain poorly understood. An increase in oxidative stress in the retina and photoreceptors is thought to be a key factor in the development of retinal disease [2]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to damage of the critical cell populations and tissue remodeling. Previous studies have revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for the oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), in the retina, following space radiation exposure [3] and spaceflight [4]. Because environmental, radiotherapy, and pathological conditions can induce the production of a high level of unstable oxygen species, efforts have been made to develop drugs with therapeutic potential. However, practical application has been somewhat disappointing due to complications such as short half-lives, low reaction rate constants, lack of cellular uptake, and hypersensitivity reactions [5]. Metal-containing catalytic antioxidants have emerged as especially promising. Of these, redox-active metalloporphyrins possess distinct antioxidant properties, including scavenging O2−, H2O2, and lipid peroxides that mediate cellular and tissue damage [6]. These compounds have proven efficacious in numerous in vivo animal models of disease in reducing oxidative stress [7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, in previous studies, we documented the protective effects of a redox-active metalloporphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) to both photoreceptors and retinal capillaries from radiation damage [11,12]. Butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin–MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, (BuOE), is a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, that is also termed BMX-001, and is currently in multiple phase 1 and phase 2 human clinical trials. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ has shown protective effects against radiation-induced damage to the brain white matter and hippocampal neurogenesis [13,14]. Our previous flight data showed a significant increase in apoptotic damage in the photoreceptors of flight mice compared to ground controls [4]. However, the pathophysiological consequences of cellular damage on photoreceptor and retinal function have not been well investigated. In the present study, mice were flown on SpX-24 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days to characterize the space environment-induced oxidative damage on ocular structure and retinal function using histochemistry, intraocular pressure (IOP), and electroretinography (ERG). The antioxidant effects of BuOE in mitigating spaceflight condition-induced retinal damage were evaluated. 2. Results 2.1. Body Weight Mice were weighed before launch and shortly before being euthanized after landing. Prior to taking off, the body weights were similar among all groups. The flight (FLT) and habitat ground control (GC) groups weighed between 25 and 27 g. The body mass after landing, for both the saline control and BuOE-treated FLT mice, was not significantly different compared to that of pre-flight measurements. However, body weights for the age-matched GC groups were significantly (p < 0.05) increased following the flight compared to pre-flight measurements (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Pre- and post-flight body mass in the flight (FLT) and habitat ground control (GC) groups. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM for mice in each group. * Significantly higher than pre-flight measurements (p < 0.05).2.2. IOP Measurement IOP was measured from a randomly selected left or right eye of each mouse before launch and shortly after landing. The post-flight saline and BuOE-treated FLT groups showed a decreasing trend in IOP, compared to pre-flight measurements, but there were no statistical differences with 11.4 and 10.2 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight saline group, and 11.3 and 10.3 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight BuOE-treated groups, respectively. The measurements for the flight groups were similar to that of the GC groups (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Each bar represents the mean counts from the left or right eyes of pre- and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice (n = 8). Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Values are the means ± SEM.2.3. ERG Assessment of Retinal Function To assess the mouse retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the ERG a-wave, which is generated by the activation of photoreceptors, a measure of photoreceptor function, and b-wave, which is primarily generated by the ON-type bipolar cell neurons [15]. Representative ERG waveforms for FLT saline vs. GC saline and FLT saline vs. FLT BuOE-treated groups were compared in Figure 3a,b. The figures illustrate average a- and b-wave amplitude measurements in response to the strongest flash, with stimulus energies of log 2.5 cd·s/m2 over implicit time. The amplitudes for a- and b-waves for the flight groups were reduced when compared to controls. The waveforms were similar between post-flight saline and BuOE-treated groups. The longitudinal changes of amplitude and implicit time (time-to-peak) for a- and b-waves with increased flash intensities for pre- and post-flight FLT and GC groups were presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Differences in amplitude and implicit time to light stimulation were noted in the FLT group following the spaceflight when they were compared to pre-flight measurements or the GC group. Reduced amplitudes and delayed peak time observed in the FLT group may indicate low sensitivity of cone cells in response to stimulus flash. Figure 3.

Each point represents the mean± SEM (n = 8). Note that the response is lower with increased flash intensity in the post-flight group compared to the pre-flight response. The response is similar between pre- and post-GC measurements.When compared to pre-flight, the amplitude of the a- and b-wave that reflected an average response to all flash intensities in the post-flight group was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for both saline and BuOE-treated groups (Figure 6a,c), while the amplitude of a- and b-waves for pre- and post-flight in the GC group was similar (Figure 6b,d). Figure 6.

The amplitude of the a-wave in the BuOE-treated group was close to the GC controls. Our ERG data also showed that the average amplitude of the b-wave that elicited a light-invoked slow cornea-positive potential was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 39% and 25% in FLT saline or BuOE-treated mice compared to their habitat ground control counterparts, respectively (Figure 8). No differences for b-waves were found among any of the pre-flight groups. Figure 7.

Apoptosis in the Retina Apoptosis in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (ECs) was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end label (TUNEL) staining. Apoptotic cells labeled with green fluorescence (Figure 9a) were mostly detected in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina of the flight saline group was 67% higher than GC controls, with a strong trend difference (p = 0.056) (Figure 9b). The counts for apoptosis were similar between the BuOE-treated and saline flight groups. The data demonstrate that spaceflight conditions induce retinal apoptosis. The retinal ECs showed a similar level of apoptosis across all groups (Figure 9c). Figure 9.

Strong trend differences between FLT saline vs. GC saline (p = 0.058), and FLT BuOE vs. GC BuOE (p = 0.056).2.5. Oxidative Damage in the Photoreceptor The 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) marker for oxidative damage was evaluated in the retina. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL in the spaceflight group compared to all other groups (Figure 10a). As shown in Figure 10b, the fluorescent intensity of 4-HNE in the photoreceptor cones of the flight group mice was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to both the ground controls and the BuOE-treated flight group. The immunoactivity of HNE immunoreactivity in BuOE-treated FLT retina was similar to saline or BuOE-treated GC groups. Figure 10.

Quantitative evaluation (Figure 10c) revealed a decrease of 20% in the cone photoreceptor density in the spaceflight saline mice, with an average of 812 counts/mm2 compared to the GC group which had an average of 1007 counts/mm2 (p = 0.067). There were no significant differences in the cone density between the flight saline and BuOE groups.3. Discussion Observed changes following spaceflight include increased oxidative damage and increased apoptosis in the mouse retinal nuclear layer and photoreceptors. ERG data, for the first time, demonstrated that spaceflight evoked changes in photoreceptor function in a mouse model. The average amplitudes of a- and b-waves for the flight group were significantly reduced when compared to controls. Our results show that FLT mice did not gain weight after the flight as was observed for the age-matched GC group. Other spaceflight studies reported a loss in body mass after spaceflight [16,17]. It has been proposed that the lack of increase in body mass may be related to mixed factors, including dehydration, stress, altered glucose, and lipid metabolism, or less food consumption [18,19]. Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for the development and progression of many ocular diseases, especially glaucoma [20]. IOP and intracranial pressure (ICP) changes are suspected to be involved in the ocular anatomical changes and visual function impairment exhibited by some astronauts [21]. Results from head–down bed-rest studies, which simulate the microgravity effects, have shown IOP and ocular blood flow changes. These changes are implicated in the pathophysiology of optic disk edema [22]. For our study, within 20 h of splashdown, we measured the IOP of flight and control groups in fully conscious mice. The data were consistent with previous observations and showed no significant differences between pre- and post-flight groups, or between flight and control groups. This indicates that a 35-day space mission may have a limited impact on irreversible IOP changes pathologically. One possible explanation is that IOP is a transient and time-sensitive parameter. Changes can happen within seconds to minutes. Due to logistical limitations, we were unable to measure IOP until 20 h after splashdown, and elevations in this readout may not have been detectable. Studies have shown that IOP fluctuates considerably with time, body postural change, venous pressure changes, and stress levels [23]. Further evaluation of IOP during spaceflight or longer time sustained microgravity conditions will be required. The ERG is an electrical potential generated in response to light stimulation of the retina and recorded from the corneal surface of the eye. ERG technology is a powerful approach in assessing retina function [24] and ganglion cell activity [25]. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin) [26], whereby the S-cones are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) peak at 360 nm, and M-cones and rods are responsive to the green light at peak 504 nm. Previous studies suggested that the mouse cone system predominantly expresses S-opsin [27]. Since S-opsin sensitivity drops significantly at wavelengths longer than 425 nm, only UV light is efficient in stimulating mouse S-opsin [27]. In our present study, we focused on probing S-cone-mediated properties using UV light stimulation. Despite the small percentage of cones in the mouse photoreceptor (5%) [28], cone-mediated responses in mouse ganglion cells are fast and sensitive. Our measurement enables us to quantify cone-mediated response and correlate this with histochemistry evaluation. Cone bipolar pathways are similar to those found in mammals [29]. Therefore, the mouse is potentially a useful model to study cone-mediated vision and for diseases that affects the cone function in humans [27,29]. The two ERG components that are most often measured are the a- and b-waves. The a-wave is the first large negative component that reflects the physiological status of photoreceptor rods and cones, followed by the b-wave, which is a cornea-positive amplitude. The b-wave reflects the health of the inner layers of the retina, including the ON bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization in response to increases in light stimulation [15]. Reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes documented in the flight group indicate retinal photoreceptor damage and disturbance of retinal physiological function. These changes are associated with the observed increase in apoptosis in the inner nuclear ganglion cell layer, and a decrease in cone density following spaceflight. Abnormal ERG is recognized in many ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and cone dystrophy [15,30,31]. Most human retina disorders are detected by attenuation of amplitude [25]. Studies have also shown a correlation between a decrease in cone-driven function through reductions of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes and cone photoreceptor loss in a light damage model [32]. Our ERG and histological findings, for the first time, show that spaceflight-induced retinal functional change may occur as a result of photoreceptor damage and cellular death. It is important to characterize and monitor retinal changes that may lead to the progression of retinal disease and retinal degeneration. Retinal neurons include amacrine, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. Radiation-induced photoreceptor loss has been shown in a previous study with 1 Gy of iron-56 irradiation [33]. Studies from the Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) and Rodent Study-9 (RR-9) also showed a significant increase in apoptotic cell damage in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and INL of the flight mice photoreceptors [34,35]. Retinal nuclear cell damage causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases [36]. Retinas are more sensitive to environmental damage than other central nervous system (CNS) neurons [37]. Apoptotic cell death is documented in many forms of retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration [38]. These findings suggest that retinal nuclear and photoreceptor cells play an important role in maintaining the normal structure and function of the retina. Our data revealed significant increases in retinal nuclear/photoreceptor cell death and a trend showing a decrease in cone density by spaceflight. The presence of apoptotic positive cells in this study supports the hypothesis that apoptotic mechanisms are involved in retinal cell death. Further studies will be required to determine whether these effects are reversible or continue to deteriorate over time. Oxidative stress-induced ocular tissue damage has been associated with a variety of pathological conditions [2,39,40]. Oxidative stress is one of the leading causes of retinal damage and retinal degenerative diseases [41]. Radiation-induced oxidative stress can damage critical cellular structure and biomolecules [42], resulting in inflammatory responses, cell death, and tissue remodeling [43,44]. We have shown in our previous studies that spaceflight and space radiation exposures cause oxidative changes in the retina and retinal vasculature [34,45,46]. HNE is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress [47]. This flight study documented increased oxidative damage with 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL [4]. The correlation between increased oxidative damage in photoreceptors and abnormal ERG recording indicates that spaceflight impacts the retinal structure, physiology and function. In future studies, we will determine if these observed changes will persist or reverse with a longer re-adaption period. The safety of BuOE has been evaluated in a battery of nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant studies. Systemic toxicity has been evaluated using the intended cGMP product administered subcutaneously for periods of up to 5 weeks in both mouse and the monkey, and have included toxicokinetic evaluations to characterize systemic exposure, tissue distribution, and clearance of BuOE [48]. Redox-active metalloporphyrin antioxidants have been shown to be effective in protecting against radiation-induced ocular damage [11]. In the present study, with the current injection dose, our results showed that BuOE is safe. Body weights among saline- or BuOE-treated ground control groups were similar and no overt sign of toxicity related to this compound was observed. Immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker, HNE, was significantly reduced in the BuOE-treated flight group compared to the flight saline group. This suggests that BuOE was effective in reducing reactive oxygen species that activate retinal stress responses during space flight [49,50]. Metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants are potent detoxifiers of lipid peroxides and lipoperoxyl radicals, a process that is mediated via hydroxyl radicals [6,51]. Our present study suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing mechanism for observed damage in the retina and photoreceptor, which was demonstrated by increased 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation. Adding BuOE, a lipophilic metalloporphyrin compound with high potency for the catalysis of lipid peroxidation reduced immunoreactivity of the biomarker in the BuOE-treated ocular tissue compared to the flight saline group, suggesting a potential mechanism of oxidative stress in inducing cellular damage. However, BuOE was found to only slightly mitigate spaceflight-induced apoptosis in retinal photoreceptor or endothelial cells, suggesting that apoptosis was not inhibited. Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceflight-induced retinal functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high flash intensity (Figure 3b). It may be that the beneficial or protective effects of BuOE with the current dosage was not sufficient to significantly ameliorate the harmful spaceflight-induced effects on the retina or that alternative stressors may be directly leading to apoptosis despite reduced oxidative stress. Due to logistic limitations, the compound was injected once a week in orbit. More frequent injections may be required to protect retinal function more effectively. Daily [52,53] or twice-weekly [54] administration schedules have been reported to have significant protective effects from oxidative damage in other disease models. Free radicals produced in the ocular tissues by the mechanism other than ROS, which include reactive nitrogen species, and reactive carbonyl species [55], may be equally important in inducing cellular damage in the retina. Another plausible explanation is that spaceflight conditions induced an imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal function at a later time. We plan to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptotic status, and retinal function parameters at three months following live animal return to Earth, to further assess the ocular tissue re-adaptation process. It is anticipated that a redox-active metalloporphyrin can be effective in protecting against spaceflight-induced retinal damage.4. Material and Methods 4.1. Spaceflight and Mouse Groups Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days aboard the ISS. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle during the flight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. The flight mice were subdivided into two groups: a saline control or BuOE-treated group. BuOE at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. After returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, it took approximately 20 h for the mice to be recovered in the Atlantic Ocean, brought to shore, and transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida. Upon live return, a subset of mice (8 per group) went through IOP and ERG testing. The rest of the spaceflight mice (5 per group) were then euthanized with intraperitoneal (IP) injections of Ketamine/Xylazine (up to 150 mg/kg Ketamine combined with up to 45 mg/kg Xylazine). Their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Ground control mice were placed into the same housing hardware with environmental parameters used in flight. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on 14 October 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp Institute IACUC on 7 October 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18), and Loma Linda University Health IACUC on 8 February 2022 (Protocol Number: 8170051). The activities involving vertebrate animals were conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.2. IOP Measurement IOP in conscious animals was measured pre-launch and post-flight before euthanization with a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC, USA). The animals exhibited no signs of discomfort during the procedure. Five to six sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse [56]. 4.3. ERG To measure photoreceptor function, ERG was recorded using a Micron® Ganzfeld ERG system (Phoenix-Micron, Inc., Bend, OR, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were dark-adapted for at least 3 h prior to obtaining ERG recordings which were performed on the right eyes. Mice were maintained under anesthesia with 1.5–2% Isoflurane through a nose cone and placed on a heated stage during testing to prevent hypothermia throughout the procedure. The pupils were dilated with 1–2 drops of 0.5% tropicamide (Akorn, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Paragon BioTeck, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) ophthalmic solutions. Hypromellose (Gonak™) ophthalmic demulcent solution (2.5%) (Akorn, Inc.) was topically administered to the eyes for proper contact with the corneal electrode. The Ganzfeld optical head includes three LEDs with 360, 504, and 850 nm wavelengths. It illuminates the eye with near-infrared at 850 nm during alignment of the corneal electrode guided by the Eye-Cockpit ( IDS uEye software version 4.3, IDS Imaging Development Systems Inc., Minato City, Tokyo) camera software. Three electrodes were attached to record the transretinal electrical signals: the Ganzfeld corneal (positive) electrode was made of a gold conducting ring around the objective lens, contact-attached to the cornea, sealing the eye. A reference (negative) electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the head skin positioned midline between the ears, such that the end of the needle was between the eyes. Finally, a ground electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the base of the tail. ERG was recorded according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following signal baseline stabilization, ERG signals were recorded in response to increasing intensities of 360 nm Ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes (1 ms duration). Ganzfeld uses a Maxwellian view of illumination, which projects single light to the eye pupil illuminating the retina with high divergence. For each mouse, five sweeps of electrical responses were acquired at each intensity flash, with varying stimulus intervals (Table 1). The waveform amplitudes (microvolts) and implicit times (seconds) of a- and b-waves at each flash stimulus were acquired from five averaged sweeps and analyzed using the Labscribe software (LabScribeERG version 3.016800, iWorx systems, Dover, NH, USA). The amplitude of the a-wave represents the photoreceptor layer hyperpolarization (negative) signal and the b-wave represents the inner retinal bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization (positive) response signal. Data obtained from all mice were averaged to represent the mean ± standard error (SEM) of a-wave and b-wave amplitudes. Table 1.

TUNEL Assay Six μm sections were cut through each left eye for analysis. Five ocular sections, roughly 100 μm apart, were evaluated using the TUNEL assay to identify and quantify apoptotic cells, according to standard procedures. Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (1:100, catalog no. DL-1177, Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). 4.5. IHC Staining Six µm paraffin-embedded section of the left eye from 5 mice per group, roughly 100 μm apart, were used for analysis. To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (catalog no. FL-1071, Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature, for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18–21 h) at 4 °C with rabbit primary anti-4-HNE antibody (1:1000, catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX, USA). After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog no. A11011, Life Technologies Corp., Eugene, OR, USA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and were mounted and cover-slipped with Vectashield Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (catalog no. H-1700, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).4.6. Quantification of Immunostaining Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination at 20X magnification, spanning the entire retina per section. For quantitative analysis, the total numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted. For cone density, numbers of PNA-positive cells were counted within the entire nuclear layer of the field image. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using the ImageJ v1.4 software. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retinal sections that were 100 μm apart per eye was used as a single experimental value. The density profiles were expressed as the mean number of apoptotic cells or cone cells/mm2 for 5 samples of each group. To quantify HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6–10 randomly selected fields and calculated using the Image J software. The data were extracted and averaged within the group.4.7. Statistical Analysis We tested the normality of data distribution for IOP, ERG, 4-HNE, PNA, and TUNEL assays using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The data were then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons. The means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. α-level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance.Acknowledgments Sungshin Choi contributed significantly to the success of our study and we greatly appreciate her support.

    "abstract": "Abstract Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity. Keywords: Position sense, Proprioception, Microgravity, Hypergravity, Parabolic flight",
    "introduction": "Introduction The ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception includes the senses of position, movement, force, heaviness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia 2012). Arguably, the sense of position is the most important of these, since it is believed to contribute to our self-awareness (Cole 1995) and it is an important contributor to the control of reaching movements (Desmurget et al. 1995; Sarlegna and Sainsburg, 2009). When considering methods of measuring position sense, there is currently no agreement over the preferred method of choice. This problem was recently addressed by Roach et al. (2023) who studied three commonly employed methods. These were two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning. Somewhat unexpectedly, each method produced a significantly different outcome. This led to the question, do we have more than one position sense? We have maintained a continuing interest in position sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that under conditions of weightlessness position sense is disturbed (Young et al. 1984; Kenyon and Young 1986; Weber et al. 2020). It has led us to speculate about possible mechanisms responsible for the disturbance (Weber and Proske 2022; Proske and Weber 2023). In the light of the findings by Roach et al. (2023) we have decided to re-measure position sense during changes in gravity with each of the three methods and to look for differences in outcomes. Here we were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of position sense. Arguably the most influential study of the effects of changes in gravity on position sense is that by Lackner and DiZio (1992). Position sense was measured, using a two-arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in gravity during parabolic flight. However, rather than studying position sense directly, the authors made observations on the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al. 1972). The method has the advantage of producing large changes in position sense for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied. Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those of Bock (1994) and Bringoux et al. (2012). The explanation preferred by Lackner & DiZio for their findings was that spindle output per unit stretch of arm muscles was influenced by G-level. Spindle rates can be altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimotor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibration responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects was based on the findings of Bringoux et al. (2012). They showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. We have considered the possibility that the normal position signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, was likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023). In hypergravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the position signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint torque would lower the joint receptor component and therefore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values using the three methods and asked the question, were all three similarly affected by the changes in gravity? In the present study we have chosen to measure position sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. In view of the findings of Roach et al. (2023), we have considered the possibility of the existence of more than one position sense (Weber and Proske 2022). It has led us to re-examine the question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense, more broadly. Participants were asked to measure position sense with each of the three methods, during periods of high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic flights. The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured with each method.",
    "methods": "Methods Sample 12 adult participants (1female, 11male) 26–53 years old (M = 37.9 years, ± 8.2 SD), took part in the present study. Participation was voluntary. One of the participants had previously taken part in similar parabolic flight campaigns. None of the participants performed regular fitness exercises with their arms or reported current or past arm injuries. All participants underwent a medical assessment before taking part in the flight campaign. In addition, their health status was checked on the first day of the week of the flight campaign by an aviation physician. Participants were informed in advance about the experimental tasks and procedures and all provided written, informed consent. The experimental protocol was approved by a French ethics committee (“Comité de protection des personnes Sud-Méditerranée I”; ID RCB number: 2023-A01115-40). Ethical aspects of the project conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki.",
    "results": "Results Pre-flight As a first step, the data acquired on the ground (preflight session) were analysed. Since errors in the different experiments were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test; W = 0.89), a rmANOVA could be performed, comparing the averaged position errors in the three experiments. A significant overall main effect was found in rmANOVA (F (2,22) = 10.99; p <.001; η2 = 0.50). Post-comparisons indicated that errors were largest for pointing (M = 5.95°; SD = 5.64°), which were significantly larger than for matching (M = 0.97°; SD = 4.0°; p <.0025, two-tailed testing, 2tt) and repositioning (M = -0.19°; SD = 3.96°; p <.007; 2tt; see Table 1).

During two-arm matching at 1G, (NG), the mean error for the 5 episodes of horizontal flight was 4.4°. That is, the participant matched the position of their reference arm by placing the indicator 4.4° further in the direction of extension. For the first period of hypergravity (HG 1) the mean error into extension increased to 4.8°. It then fell to 2.5° during the episode of microgravity (MG), to reach a value of 7.7° during the second period of hypergravity (HG 2). In other words, in relation to errors at 1G, there was an increase in hypergravity and a decrease in microgravity. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Data from a single participant. a: Two-arm matching, b: One-arm pointing, c: One-arm repositioning. Values for individual trials are joined as grey lines. Each line represents a single parabola. Mean error values for the five parabolae are shown as black circles (± SD). The convention was used that positive values were assigned to errors in the direction of elbow extension, negative values to errors in the direction of flexionFor one-arm pointing, the pattern of errors was similar. The NG value for the mean of the 5 trials was 7.1° in the direction of extension. This increased to 10.9° during HG 1 and to 10.6° during HG 2. In microgravity it fell to 5.7°. A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. Finally, for repositioning the errors were all smaller than for matching and pointing. The NG value was 0.5°. This fell to -1.8° during HG 1, that is, the mean error was now 1.8° in the direction of flexion. The error was again − 1.8° for HG 2 and − 0.6° for MG. In-flight, group data Group errors for the 12 participants are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that errors in repositioning were much smaller than in matching and pointing. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity value is clearly apparent. Values for matching were smaller than for pointing. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Matching, pointing and repositioning errors during the different gravity episodes for 12 participants.

Values for individual participants shown as grey dots. *p <.05; **p <.01In-flight errors were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test; W = 0.75; p =.00191), making it necessary to process the data with non-parametric statistics. First, it was tested whether there was an overall effect of experiments on error values during the normal gravity episode. Friedman indicated significant differences (χ2(2) = 17.6; p <.001). Again, errors in pointing (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°) were significantly larger compared to repositioning (M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°, p =.00669, 2tt) and matching (M = 2.48°; SD = 3.8°; p =.00665, 2tt, see Table 1) as indicated by Wilcoxon tests. Next, the errors in the two hypergravity episodes HG1 and HG2 were compared. For all three experiments, no significant difference was found in Wilcoxon tests (Z = 0.39 − 0.71, 2tt). Therefore, errors in HG1 and HG2 were combined and averaged for the subsequent analysis and labelled as hypergravity condition (HG). Additionally, the preflight error values were compared to the normal gravity flight episodes (NG), but no significant difference was found when performing the Wilcoxon test in the three experiments (Z = 0.27–2.12; 2tt). Further analysis used only the in-flight values for normal gravity (NG). The reason was that during flight there were small fluctuations in g-values (see Fig. 2). For this reason, and in order to take into account possible effects of Scopolamine administration, comparisons were limited to within flight. Next, the normal gravity episodes (NG) were compared with the microgravity (MG) and hypergravity (HG) episodes, (see Table 1; Fig. 4). For matching, two Wilcoxon tests were performed, indicating that error values were significantly lower (i.e. less forearm extension) for MG (M = 0.35°; SD = 3.50°) compared to NG (M = 2.48°; SD = 3.80°; p =.0121, one-tailed testing, 1tt). On the other hand, for HG, error values were significantly higher (M = 3.48°; SD = 3.29°; p =.0497, 1tt) compared to the NG baseline. Wilcoxon comparisons for pointing showed a trend for error values to be lower in MG (M = 7.28°; SD = 5.63°) compared to the NG values (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°), although the required level of significance was not reached (p =.0583, 1tt). Again, error values for HG were significantly higher (M = 11.21°; SD = 4.38°) compared to NG (p <.00222, 1tt). For the repositioning task, the two Wilcoxon tests comparing NG (M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°) with HG (M = -0.50°; SD = 4.62°) and MG (M = 0.23°; SD = 3.35°) did not reveal any significant differences. In summary, for matching, during hypergravity position errors increased significantly compared with 1G values, while in microgravity they fell significantly. For pointing, errors during hypergravity increased significantly, but the fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach significance. By contrast, errors during repositioning showed no significant changes during either increases or decreases in gravity. In addition, the control values in normal gravity for repositioning were significantly smaller than for pointing (p <.003, 2tt).",
    "discussion": "Discussion When we embarked on the present study, it was to ask the question, did gravity influence position sense, no matter what method of measurement was used (Weber and Proske 2022)? The present study has shown that for position sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in gravity had significant effects on the measured values. For repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values were unresponsive to changes in gravity. Given these differences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the importance of declaring the method used whenever position sense is measured, both at ground level and under conditions of weightlessness. Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. In Roach et al. (2023), before each measurement, elbow muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors. Since muscle spindles are the only known sensory receptors to exhibit thixotropy (Proske et al. 1993), such patterns were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in generation of the position signals. There was evidence of spindle participation in position sense measured with two-arm matching and one-arm pointing, while for repositioning the evidence was weak. Such an outcome reflected a similar pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study. It tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that gravity effects could be revealed as well. It was as though in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were linked in some way with the participation of spindles. That conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key role in the observed gravity-dependent changes in position sense. In the present study, for matching and pointing there were increases in errors in hypergravity and decreases in microgravity. What might that mean? As mentioned, it is believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal during movements about a joint; an increase in spindle discharge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended joint (Matthews 1988). We suggest that there is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development (Held and Bauer 1967). If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. Since the reference remains fixed at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher than expected from 1G values. The indicator would move towards the position of the reference, until a point was reached where the signals from the two arms matched. For elbow flexors this would be a position where the indicator arm was more extended than the reference. If spindle discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for elbow extension below those for 1G levels. This argument does not consider the spindle signals in the antagonist extensors. Presumably, in real life, it is the effect of gravity on the balance of discharges in flexors and extensors which determines the direction of the errors. However, in the present study, all of the errors for matching and pointing were in the direction of elbow extension (Fig. 4), including the values in normal gravity, suggesting that the signal coming from the flexors dominated the outcome. It could be argued that the smaller errors in microgravity represented a more accurate measurement and not be a disturbance at all. We propose that whenever the prevailing spindle discharge rates are altered, up or down, away from their normal 1G level, this should be seen as a disturbance. These gravity-dependent alterations in the spindle rate: joint angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are made in the absence of vision. Here it should, perhaps, be remembered that there is some evidence for gravity-based influences acting on position sense measured at ground level, under 1G conditions. When participants were asked to judge elbow position with respect to the vertical, they performed better than when asked to focus on joint angles (Soechting 1982). Why should spindle discharges increase or decrease during gravity changes? In an arm reaching task it was shown by Bringoux et al. (2012) that during parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. Participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the movement, recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. One possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor activity required to overcome the additional torque generated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co-activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges. We have suggested an alternate explanation. The normal position signal, especially when generated near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, is likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023; Proske and Weber 2023). Joint receptors have an “activation angle” where they begin to generate a maintained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15°-20° short of the limit of movement at the joint. Therefore, when a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and activated joint receptors. The details have been spelt out in Proske (2024a). When hypergravity imposes extra torque on the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportunity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component of the position signal. In microgravity, if the arm becomes weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and, as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering the position signal. Stretching elastic straps across the joint would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor component of the position signal. That, in turn, would recover position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. To further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint. There is an interesting report by Motanova et al. (2022) describing construction of a “penguin axial loading suit” for use in microgravity conditions. The purpose of the suit was to create axial load, to help compensate for the lack of proprioceptive afferent feedback in microgravity. The suit incorporates a system of inbuilt elastic elements which are distributed according to the demands of selected antagonist muscle groups. The ideas underlying construction of such a suit support our joint receptor hypothesis. In the present study, for pointing, the error values were significantly larger than for matching (Fig. 4). Not only were values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at 1G were larger as well. A similar trend in the distribution of pointing errors was observed by Roach et al. (2023). It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of pointing errors. One possible explanation is that for pointing the proprioceptive information coming from the hidden reference arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to guide the pointing arm. Such a conversion comes with additional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive measurement (Darling et al. 2024). We suggest that such an offset was present in the parabolic measurements. A detailed explanation for the size and direction of the offset remains elusive. The question arises, do frame of reference considerations also apply to two-arm matching? Here we have always assumed that both arms were in the same postural frame of reference (Velay et al. 1989). Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity. Evidence in support of two-arm matching operating within a single frame of reference is the symmetrical distribution of thixotropic errors in both arms (Roach et al. 2023). From another point of view, two-arm matching is considered a low-level judgement, made within a single frame of reference (Heroux et al., 2022). The findings for repositioning were rather different from those for matching and pointing. The errors were all rather small and there was no significant difference between position sense values during changes in gravity. Our original working hypothesis for repositioning had been that when a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle was stored in memory. Subsequently, when the participant was asked to reposition the arm, the spindle discharge for that angle was retrieved from memory and compared with the ongoing level of activity, as the arm moved towards the remembered angle, until the two matched. However, such an explanation turned out to be wrong! The data of Roach et al. (2023) suggested that in repositioning ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role. It raised the possibility that in generating the position signal the necessary information was likely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b). In support of that view, Roach et al. (2023) did an additional experiment where they introduced thixotropic disturbances after the memorizing stage and before the reproduction stage. The data showed that this did not alter repositioning errors. If spindles had been involved, it should have led to increases in position errors. While we cannot rule out participation of sensory receptors other than spindles in the repositioning process, our current preferred interpretation is that position information in repositioning was largely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b). The observations made in the present experiments support the view that in repositioning there was no direct involvement of spindles. Despite the significant changes in gravity-dependent errors in matching and pointing, presumably mediated by changes in spindle afferent activity, for repositioning, errors in both hypergravity and microgravity remained non-significant. Furthermore, for repositioning, even the value during normal gravity was lower than for pointing. We conclude that of the three methods, repositioning was the most accurate and position sense values remained unresponsive to changes in gravity, suggesting that spindles played no role in this sense. Presumably, repositioning values were generated entirely centrally. In the future, we want to confirm this conclusion by repeating the repositioning experiment, but carry out the memorizing and repositioning stages in different gravity phases. We suggest that the instruction to the participant, “Remember this angle”, leads them to focus their attention on the position of the arm, which immediately provides them with the precise angular information for that position. A memory is triggered, expressed in terms of angles of joints and lengths of muscles, but which, at the time of measurement, does not involve any ongoing spindle activity in arm muscles. The memory is referred to a central storage site for spatial information and kept there, ready for the instruction to reproduce the remembered position. These ideas are, of course, purely speculative and it is our intention to put them to the test in future experiments. Looking more broadly, the present data support the view that different methods of measuring position sense involve fundamentally different underlying processes which will impact the meaning of a particular measurement. This is particularly relevant for the method of repositioning which is the preferred method used in most proprioceptive research and is widely employed in clinical settings. What we are learning is that the three different methods of measuring position sense are all likely to have different underlying mechanisms and it could be argued that there are several distinct position senses. There appear to be two sources of influence determining human position sense. One is afferent signals of a peripheral origin providing information about muscle lengths and joint angles. The other is a central repository of recently remembered information concerning position of the body and its parts in egocentric and extrapersonal space, which can be accessed to provide accurate spatial information about limb position. The three methods of measurement used in the present study seem to show a progressive transition between these two influences; from one which relies almost entirely on peripheral afferent information, two-arm matching, to one that contains elements of both peripheral and central influences, one-arm pointing, to one which is concerned predominantly with central sources of information, repositioning. Gravity appears to exert an influence on position sense only when there is evidence of a direct contribution from spindles, as seen in matching and pointing. For repositioning it appears that the central influences predominate. What is unexpected is the finding that the position values derived centrally are more accurate than those which involve spindles. The concept of a central repository of position information operating independently of peripheral influences is also novel. Presumably the stored information is acquired, in part, through memories of past kinesthetic activities. To conclude, this study has raised a number of issues. Does gravity exert its influence on position sense through changes in torque levels at a joint, leading to an alteration of the joint receptor component of the position signal? If so, why is this not expressed in position sense measured by repositioning? Assuming the existence of a body schema as the central repository of spatial information, how is the communication carried out between the body periphery and central sites? Are spindles involved in this process? Given that the three methods studied here measure essentially the same thing, why are there such substantial differences in the underlying mechanisms? If we are right and repositioning operates substantially independently of peripheral sources of positional information, what is the significance of that? All of these issues will, hopefully, be addressed in future experiments.",

Copyright notice ID: 12031868 PMID: 40278861 Abstract Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity. Keywords: Position sense, Proprioception, Microgravity, Hypergravity, Parabolic flightIntroduction The ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception includes the senses of position, movement, force, heaviness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia 2012). Arguably, the sense of position is the most important of these, since it is believed to contribute to our self-awareness (Cole 1995) and it is an important contributor to the control of reaching movements (Desmurget et al. 1995; Sarlegna and Sainsburg, 2009). When considering methods of measuring position sense, there is currently no agreement over the preferred method of choice. This problem was recently addressed by Roach et al. (2023) who studied three commonly employed methods. These were two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning. Somewhat unexpectedly, each method produced a significantly different outcome. This led to the question, do we have more than one position sense? We have maintained a continuing interest in position sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that under conditions of weightlessness position sense is disturbed (Young et al. 1984; Kenyon and Young 1986; Weber et al. 2020). It has led us to speculate about possible mechanisms responsible for the disturbance (Weber and Proske 2022; Proske and Weber 2023). In the light of the findings by Roach et al. (2023) we have decided to re-measure position sense during changes in gravity with each of the three methods and to look for differences in outcomes. Here we were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of position sense. Arguably the most influential study of the effects of changes in gravity on position sense is that by Lackner and DiZio (1992). Position sense was measured, using a two-arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in gravity during parabolic flight. However, rather than studying position sense directly, the authors made observations on the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al. 1972). The method has the advantage of producing large changes in position sense for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied. Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those of Bock (1994) and Bringoux et al. (2012). The explanation preferred by Lackner & DiZio for their findings was that spindle output per unit stretch of arm muscles was influenced by G-level. Spindle rates can be altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimotor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibration responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects was based on the findings of Bringoux et al. (2012). They showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. We have considered the possibility that the normal position signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, was likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023). In hypergravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the position signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint torque would lower the joint receptor component and therefore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values using the three methods and asked the question, were all three similarly affected by the changes in gravity? In the present study we have chosen to measure position sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. In view of the findings of Roach et al. (2023), we have considered the possibility of the existence of more than one position sense (Weber and Proske 2022). It has led us to re-examine the question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense, more broadly. Participants were asked to measure position sense with each of the three methods, during periods of high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic flights. The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured with each method.Methods Sample 12 adult participants (1female, 11male) 26–53 years old (M = 37.9 years, ± 8.2 SD), took part in the present study. Participation was voluntary. One of the participants had previously taken part in similar parabolic flight campaigns. None of the participants performed regular fitness exercises with their arms or reported current or past arm injuries. All participants underwent a medical assessment before taking part in the flight campaign. In addition, their health status was checked on the first day of the week of the flight campaign by an aviation physician. Participants were informed in advance about the experimental tasks and procedures and all provided written, informed consent. The experimental protocol was approved by a French ethics committee (“Comité de protection des personnes Sud-Méditerranée I”; ID RCB number: 2023-A01115-40). Ethical aspects of the project conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki.Apparatus Experimental setup The experimental setup consisted of an equipment rack fixed to a base plate and two seats also on base plates, all bolted firmly to the floor of the aircraft. In the equipment rack, all necessary hardware components (personal computer, motor controllers, electronical components etc.) were firmly locked in place. Two paddle setups, on each side of the equipment rack, were installed, facing each other, so that two participants could perform the experiment at the same time (see Fig. 1). Each setup’s height could be adjusted individually to suit the participant. In front of each participant were two paddles, which could be moved freely in the sagittal plane over a range of 90° from the horizontal (0°) to the vertical position (90°). Mechanical stops prevented movements beyond this range. Both paddles could be automatically moved to predefined angles by integrated motors. For one of the two paddles and its motor, an electromagnetic clutch was incorporated which, when released, allowed the paddle to move freely, without any frictional or inertia effects from the motor. Indicated angles were recorded by potentiometers with an angular resolution of ± 0.3°. Selected positions of both paddles could be locked in place by motor brakes. At one end of each paddle was a soft elbow support (with a Velcro strap to hold the elbow in position) and at the other end there was a padded hand rest with a handle. The elbow rest was positioned so that the elbow pivot point and the paddle’s axis of rotation were aligned. The distance between elbow rest and hand rest as well as the distance between handle and paddle could be individually adjusted. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Experimental Setup: Two participants sat facing one another in the set-up. Both gave written consent to publicationTo ensure body stabilization during microgravity, the participants’ feet were strapped to the base plate of the experimental setup. To stabilize participants during the hypergravity phases, a seat support was placed behind the participant which they could lean against or sit on (see Fig. 1). All structures were padded with foam for protection. At one side of the rack, the experimenter’s working area was set up on the floor, equipped with a laptop for monitoring and controlling the experimental procedures.Experimental software The different gravitational phases during the parabolae (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g) were detected using an acceleration sensor. For the first hypergravity phase, measurements were initiated after gravity values reached above 1.5 g, the microgravity phase after they fell below 0.6 g, and the second hypergravity phase when the g-value was back above 1.3 g. Finally, normal gravity was triggered when gravity values had returned to below 1.15 g (Fig. 2). Each measurement phase was initiated only when gravity changes persisted for long enough. When conditions were suitable, the measurement proceeded, with the participant receiving their instructions via headphones. The control of the paddles as well as the evaluation of the accelerometer data was implemented in Matlab/ Simulink. The control software was executed on a real-time Linux platform at 1 kHz sampling rate. Timing of the pre-recorded instructions and paddle positions in a particular task were controlled by a JAVA program. The logging was implemented in C ++ enabling the automated identification of each parabola phase in separate files. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Examples of flight recordings.

Third panel: expanded view of g-values for a single parabola (parabola #2): g values in blue, red bars indicating start and end of experimental trialsThe experiments Participants completed three different experiments: (1) a two-arm matching task, (2) a one-arm a pointing task, and (3) a one-arm repositioning task. For all three experiments a test angle of 60° was used, representing approximately the middle of the forearm’s working range.Two-arm matching During this task, participants were blindfolded. The experiment started with both forearms in a flexed posture (i.e. forearm at 90° to the horizontal). To begin with, forearm muscles had to be conditioned, to account for spindle thixotropic properties. With both paddles locked in position, the participant carried out isometric contractions of elbow flexors of both arms, followed by isometric contractions of elbow extensors. The contractions were approximately 20% of maximum, 0.5s in duration. To do that, participants were asked to pull both arms towards their body (“pull”), or to push them away, (“push”). When participants had relaxed, the experimental trials were started. One paddle was unlocked and the passive forearm of the reference arm was automatically moved in the direction of extension to the test angle and held in that position. Then the clutch of the other paddle opened and they were asked to bring the indicator arm into a matching position. Participants were told to move the indicator to a position where the two arms felt aligned.One-arm pointing In the pointing experiment participants wore an eye patch over the eye closest to the reference arm which was also hidden behind a cloth. It meant that during pointing neither the reference arm nor its shoulder was visible to the participant. Before the reference arm was moved to the test angle, it was co-conditioned at 90°, as above. Participants carried out contractions of flexors followed by contractions of extensors and, once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically moved to a chosen test angle. The clutch of the other paddle opened and participants were asked to move this pointer paddle to a position that they felt corresponded to the position of the hidden reference arm. To do that, participants grasped the pointer paddle by its handle and moved it into position.One-arm repositioning Here, participants were also blindfolded. The participant co-conditioned both antagonists of one arm with isometric contractions. Once they had relaxed, the arm was automatically moved to a chosen test angle. It was held at that angle for 2s while the participant remembered its position. Then the arm was returned to its starting position before being conditioned a second time. The clutch of the paddle was released and the participant was then asked to move their arm to the remembered position. The pre-recorded instructions in all three conditions were given via headphones. The contractions in the 90° position were announced with “pull-push”, followed up by presentation of the test angle with the announcement, “test angle”. As soon as the clutch on the indicator side opened, the command “match” was given. Now the participant could set the desired matching angle; they had 6 s to do so and for the last three seconds there was a countdown “3-2-1”. At the end of the countdown, the angle adopted by the indicator arm was recorded. This procedure was necessary given the time limitations of the gravitational episodes.Experimental design There were two experimental sessions: a pre-flight session and a flight session. During flight, participants performed experimental trials during each gravity phase of a parabola: (1) hypergravity (1.8 g), (2) microgravity (0 g), (3) hypergravity (1.8 g) and (4) horizontal flight (1 g). The pre-flight data were used to provide a baseline for comparison with results acquired during the flight. During the flight, each participant performed the experimental tasks over fifteen parabolae. An experimental block during a parabola included each of the four gravity phases (1.8 g, 0 g, 1.8 g, 1 g). This made for a total of 60 trials over the 15 parabolae. Each of the three experiments was performed during five consecutive experimental blocks, while their order was counterbalanced across participants. The same procedure was adopted in the preflight session, except that the pauses of about 1 min 45 s between each parabola in flight were shortened to 40 s. Moreover, participants only completed two experimental blocks, i.e. two simulated parabolae for each condition; 6 blocks x 4 phases = 24 trials. The rest period between the three experiments was 100 s. Since it is known that there are differences in proprioception between the two arms (Goble et al. 2006), participants were assigned to the two sides of the experimental rack so that 6 participants had their dominant arm as the reference, while the other 6 had their non-dominant arm as the reference.Procedural arrangements All participants were informed about the background and procedure of the study and about the parabolic flights, in an online briefing one month before the experiment. 2–3 weeks before the campaign, all participants were also invited to the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen to receive a detailed briefing about the experimental procedure and safety instructions. In addition, the entire procedure for the three experiments was rehearsed on the apparatus. The parabolic flights were organized and carried out by NOVESPACE at Mérignac International Airport in Bordeaux. The experimental crew and participants were briefed by NOVESPACE before flight regarding general procedures and safety regulations during the flight. Two pairs of participants took part on each of the three subsequent flight days. On the morning of their flight day, participants completed the pre-flight session in the aircraft while on ground. During this session, participants were again reminded about the experimental task, setup and procedure. Then, the control experiment was carried out as described above. Immediately pre-flight, all participants (experimenter and participants) received a standard dose of Scopolamine (0.7-1.0 ml for first flyers, 0.5 ml for experienced flyers). Scopolamine is the standard medication used to minimise the risk of motion sickness during parabolic flights. Side effects can be blurred vision, drowsiness, dilated pupils and dry mouth. No participants in our study exhibited counter-reactions to the drug and the subsequent experimental trials proceeded uneventfully. However, one participant experienced motion sickness during the repositioning experiment, despite having taken the drug and had to abandon the experiment. After medication, participants boarded the flight, an Airbus A310. A complete flight took about 3.5 h and 31 parabolae were flown during this period. The first parabola (#0) was used for familiarization, i.e. participants simply lay down on the floor of the aircraft during the parabola. Then, the first pair of participants took up their positions at the setup; they were secured with a harness, positioned their feet in the foot straps and arms in the lever setup, put on the headphones and, depending on the task, the eye patch/blindfold was put in place. Meanwhile, the second pair of participants and the experimenter were sitting on the floor at the side of the rack, secured with belts to the floor of the aircraft. The typical time sequence for each parabola was ~ 20 s hypergravity, ~ 22 s microgravity, again ~ 20 s hypergravity, and finally, back to normal gravity. The transitions between the various gravity phases were monitored by the accelerometer. When the required g-value had been reached, the experiment was started and participants were instructed via the headphones. After a break (~ 1 min 45 s), the next parabola was begun (see Fig. 2). After each participant had completed five parabolae there was a break of 5 min, followed by a longer break of 8 min after 15 parabolae. During the longer break, the next two participants took up their position at the setup, the hand rests were adjusted and the same protocol was carried out, as before.Data analysis For two-arm matching, the angles of the reference and indicator arms were recorded. The matching error was calculated as the difference between the two angles (reference angle - indicator angle), where positive values corresponded to errors in the direction of arm extension and negative values in the direction of flexion. The same was done for one-arm pointing; the angle of the hidden reference arm was compared with the pointed value. The error for one-arm repositioning was calculated as the difference between the remembered angle and the repositioned angle. For the following analyses, the recorded error measures were averaged across all trials for one experiment (i.e. 2 blocks during preflight, 5 blocks for each gravitational phase during flight). The error measures were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) comparing the three experiments (matching vs. pointing vs. repositioning) in the preflight session and a 3 (experiment: matching vs. pointing vs. repositioning) x 3 (gravity: HG, MG, NG) rmANOVA for the flight session. Sphericity was checked using Mauchly’s test. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were made if non-sphericity was indicated by this test. Alpha levels of post-hoc comparisons were Bonferroni-Holm corrected. In case of non-normality of the error distributions, non-parametric Friedman tests and subsequent Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm alpha corrections were performed. For all comparisons one-tailed tests (1tt) were performed to verify directional hypotheses, otherwise two-tailed tests (2tt) were chosen. Data for one participant during the repositioning experiment is missing, since they had to abandon the experiment. As the result of a problem with data recording during the pre-flight session, values for two participants from one of the two experimental blocks in this session are missing.Results Pre-flight As a first step, the data acquired on the ground (preflight session) were analysed. Since errors in the different experiments were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test; W = 0.89), a rmANOVA could be performed, comparing the averaged position errors in the three experiments. A significant overall main effect was found in rmANOVA (F (2,22) = 10.99; p <.001; η2 = 0.50). Post-comparisons indicated that errors were largest for pointing (M = 5.95°; SD = 5.64°), which were significantly larger than for matching (M = 0.97°; SD = 4.0°; p <.0025, two-tailed testing, 2tt) and repositioning (M = -0.19°; SD = 3.96°; p <.007; 2tt; see Table 1).

During two-arm matching at 1G, (NG), the mean error for the 5 episodes of horizontal flight was 4.4°. That is, the participant matched the position of their reference arm by placing the indicator 4.4° further in the direction of extension. For the first period of hypergravity (HG 1) the mean error into extension increased to 4.8°. It then fell to 2.5° during the episode of microgravity (MG), to reach a value of 7.7° during the second period of hypergravity (HG 2). In other words, in relation to errors at 1G, there was an increase in hypergravity and a decrease in microgravity. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Data from a single participant. a: Two-arm matching, b: One-arm pointing, c: One-arm repositioning. Values for individual trials are joined as grey lines. Each line represents a single parabola. Mean error values for the five parabolae are shown as black circles (± SD). The convention was used that positive values were assigned to errors in the direction of elbow extension, negative values to errors in the direction of flexionFor one-arm pointing, the pattern of errors was similar. The NG value for the mean of the 5 trials was 7.1° in the direction of extension. This increased to 10.9° during HG 1 and to 10.6° during HG 2. In microgravity it fell to 5.7°. A feature of the errors in pointing was that while increases in errors in HG and falls in MG were smaller relative to the NG value, compared with two-arm matching, all pointing errors lay further in the direction of extension of the arm, including the value for NG. Finally, for repositioning the errors were all smaller than for matching and pointing. The NG value was 0.5°. This fell to -1.8° during HG 1, that is, the mean error was now 1.8° in the direction of flexion. The error was again − 1.8° for HG 2 and − 0.6° for MG.In-flight, group data Group errors for the 12 participants are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that errors in repositioning were much smaller than in matching and pointing. For pointing and matching the trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity value is clearly apparent. Values for matching were smaller than for pointing. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Matching, pointing and repositioning errors during the different gravity episodes for 12 participants.

Values for individual participants shown as grey dots. *p <.05; **p <.01In-flight errors were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test; W = 0.75; p =.00191), making it necessary to process the data with non-parametric statistics. First, it was tested whether there was an overall effect of experiments on error values during the normal gravity episode. Friedman indicated significant differences (χ2(2) = 17.6; p <.001). Again, errors in pointing (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°) were significantly larger compared to repositioning (M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°, p =.00669, 2tt) and matching (M = 2.48°; SD = 3.8°; p =.00665, 2tt, see Table 1) as indicated by Wilcoxon tests. Next, the errors in the two hypergravity episodes HG1 and HG2 were compared. For all three experiments, no significant difference was found in Wilcoxon tests (Z = 0.39 − 0.71, 2tt). Therefore, errors in HG1 and HG2 were combined and averaged for the subsequent analysis and labelled as hypergravity condition (HG). Additionally, the preflight error values were compared to the normal gravity flight episodes (NG), but no significant difference was found when performing the Wilcoxon test in the three experiments (Z = 0.27–2.12; 2tt). Further analysis used only the in-flight values for normal gravity (NG). The reason was that during flight there were small fluctuations in g-values (see Fig. 2). For this reason, and in order to take into account possible effects of Scopolamine administration, comparisons were limited to within flight. Next, the normal gravity episodes (NG) were compared with the microgravity (MG) and hypergravity (HG) episodes, (see Table 1; Fig. 4). For matching, two Wilcoxon tests were performed, indicating that error values were significantly lower (i.e. less forearm extension) for MG (M = 0.35°; SD = 3.50°) compared to NG (M = 2.48°; SD = 3.80°; p =.0121, one-tailed testing, 1tt). On the other hand, for HG, error values were significantly higher (M = 3.48°; SD = 3.29°; p =.0497, 1tt) compared to the NG baseline. Wilcoxon comparisons for pointing showed a trend for error values to be lower in MG (M = 7.28°; SD = 5.63°) compared to the NG values (M = 9.09°; SD = 4.42°), although the required level of significance was not reached (p =.0583, 1tt). Again, error values for HG were significantly higher (M = 11.21°; SD = 4.38°) compared to NG (p <.00222, 1tt). For the repositioning task, the two Wilcoxon tests comparing NG (M = 0.01°; SD = 3.94°) with HG (M = -0.50°; SD = 4.62°) and MG (M = 0.23°; SD = 3.35°) did not reveal any significant differences. In summary, for matching, during hypergravity position errors increased significantly compared with 1G values, while in microgravity they fell significantly. For pointing, errors during hypergravity increased significantly, but the fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach significance. By contrast, errors during repositioning showed no significant changes during either increases or decreases in gravity. In addition, the control values in normal gravity for repositioning were significantly smaller than for pointing (p <.003, 2tt).Discussion When we embarked on the present study, it was to ask the question, did gravity influence position sense, no matter what method of measurement was used (Weber and Proske 2022)? The present study has shown that for position sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in gravity had significant effects on the measured values. For repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values were unresponsive to changes in gravity. Given these differences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the importance of declaring the method used whenever position sense is measured, both at ground level and under conditions of weightlessness. Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. In Roach et al. (2023), before each measurement, elbow muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors. Since muscle spindles are the only known sensory receptors to exhibit thixotropy (Proske et al. 1993), such patterns were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in generation of the position signals. There was evidence of spindle participation in position sense measured with two-arm matching and one-arm pointing, while for repositioning the evidence was weak. Such an outcome reflected a similar pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study. It tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that gravity effects could be revealed as well. It was as though in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were linked in some way with the participation of spindles. That conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key role in the observed gravity-dependent changes in position sense. In the present study, for matching and pointing there were increases in errors in hypergravity and decreases in microgravity. What might that mean? As mentioned, it is believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal during movements about a joint; an increase in spindle discharge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended joint (Matthews 1988). We suggest that there is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development (Held and Bauer 1967). If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. Since the reference remains fixed at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher than expected from 1G values. The indicator would move towards the position of the reference, until a point was reached where the signals from the two arms matched. For elbow flexors this would be a position where the indicator arm was more extended than the reference. If spindle discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for elbow extension below those for 1G levels. This argument does not consider the spindle signals in the antagonist extensors. Presumably, in real life, it is the effect of gravity on the balance of discharges in flexors and extensors which determines the direction of the errors. However, in the present study, all of the errors for matching and pointing were in the direction of elbow extension (Fig. 4), including the values in normal gravity, suggesting that the signal coming from the flexors dominated the outcome. It could be argued that the smaller errors in microgravity represented a more accurate measurement and not be a disturbance at all. We propose that whenever the prevailing spindle discharge rates are altered, up or down, away from their normal 1G level, this should be seen as a disturbance. These gravity-dependent alterations in the spindle rate: joint angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are made in the absence of vision. Here it should, perhaps, be remembered that there is some evidence for gravity-based influences acting on position sense measured at ground level, under 1G conditions. When participants were asked to judge elbow position with respect to the vertical, they performed better than when asked to focus on joint angles (Soechting 1982). Why should spindle discharges increase or decrease during gravity changes? In an arm reaching task it was shown by Bringoux et al. (2012) that during parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. Participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the movement, recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. One possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor activity required to overcome the additional torque generated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co-activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges. We have suggested an alternate explanation. The normal position signal, especially when generated near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, is likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske 2023; Proske and Weber 2023). Joint receptors have an “activation angle” where they begin to generate a maintained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15°-20° short of the limit of movement at the joint. Therefore, when a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and activated joint receptors. The details have been spelt out in Proske (2024a). When hypergravity imposes extra torque on the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportunity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component of the position signal. In microgravity, if the arm becomes weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and, as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering the position signal. Stretching elastic straps across the joint would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor component of the position signal. That, in turn, would recover position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. To further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint. There is an interesting report by Motanova et al. (2022) describing construction of a “penguin axial loading suit” for use in microgravity conditions. The purpose of the suit was to create axial load, to help compensate for the lack of proprioceptive afferent feedback in microgravity. The suit incorporates a system of inbuilt elastic elements which are distributed according to the demands of selected antagonist muscle groups. The ideas underlying construction of such a suit support our joint receptor hypothesis. In the present study, for pointing, the error values were significantly larger than for matching (Fig. 4). Not only were values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at 1G were larger as well. A similar trend in the distribution of pointing errors was observed by Roach et al. (2023). It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of pointing errors. One possible explanation is that for pointing the proprioceptive information coming from the hidden reference arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to guide the pointing arm. Such a conversion comes with additional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive measurement (Darling et al. 2024). We suggest that such an offset was present in the parabolic measurements. A detailed explanation for the size and direction of the offset remains elusive. The question arises, do frame of reference considerations also apply to two-arm matching? Here we have always assumed that both arms were in the same postural frame of reference (Velay et al. 1989). Certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity. Evidence in support of two-arm matching operating within a single frame of reference is the symmetrical distribution of thixotropic errors in both arms (Roach et al. 2023). From another point of view, two-arm matching is considered a low-level judgement, made within a single frame of reference (Heroux et al., 2022). The findings for repositioning were rather different from those for matching and pointing. The errors were all rather small and there was no significant difference between position sense values during changes in gravity. Our original working hypothesis for repositioning had been that when a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle was stored in memory. Subsequently, when the participant was asked to reposition the arm, the spindle discharge for that angle was retrieved from memory and compared with the ongoing level of activity, as the arm moved towards the remembered angle, until the two matched. However, such an explanation turned out to be wrong! The data of Roach et al. (2023) suggested that in repositioning ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role. It raised the possibility that in generating the position signal the necessary information was likely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b). In support of that view, Roach et al. (2023) did an additional experiment where they introduced thixotropic disturbances after the memorizing stage and before the reproduction stage. The data showed that this did not alter repositioning errors. If spindles had been involved, it should have led to increases in position errors. While we cannot rule out participation of sensory receptors other than spindles in the repositioning process, our current preferred interpretation is that position information in repositioning was largely derived from central sources (Proske 2024b). The observations made in the present experiments support the view that in repositioning there was no direct involvement of spindles. Despite the significant changes in gravity-dependent errors in matching and pointing, presumably mediated by changes in spindle afferent activity, for repositioning, errors in both hypergravity and microgravity remained non-significant. Furthermore, for repositioning, even the value during normal gravity was lower than for pointing. We conclude that of the three methods, repositioning was the most accurate and position sense values remained unresponsive to changes in gravity, suggesting that spindles played no role in this sense. Presumably, repositioning values were generated entirely centrally. In the future, we want to confirm this conclusion by repeating the repositioning experiment, but carry out the memorizing and repositioning stages in different gravity phases. We suggest that the instruction to the participant, “Remember this angle”, leads them to focus their attention on the position of the arm, which immediately provides them with the precise angular information for that position. A memory is triggered, expressed in terms of angles of joints and lengths of muscles, but which, at the time of measurement, does not involve any ongoing spindle activity in arm muscles. The memory is referred to a central storage site for spatial information and kept there, ready for the instruction to reproduce the remembered position. These ideas are, of course, purely speculative and it is our intention to put them to the test in future experiments. Looking more broadly, the present data support the view that different methods of measuring position sense involve fundamentally different underlying processes which will impact the meaning of a particular measurement. This is particularly relevant for the method of repositioning which is the preferred method used in most proprioceptive research and is widely employed in clinical settings. What we are learning is that the three different methods of measuring position sense are all likely to have different underlying mechanisms and it could be argued that there are several distinct position senses. There appear to be two sources of influence determining human position sense. One is afferent signals of a peripheral origin providing information about muscle lengths and joint angles. The other is a central repository of recently remembered information concerning position of the body and its parts in egocentric and extrapersonal space, which can be accessed to provide accurate spatial information about limb position. The three methods of measurement used in the present study seem to show a progressive transition between these two influences; from one which relies almost entirely on peripheral afferent information, two-arm matching, to one that contains elements of both peripheral and central influences, one-arm pointing, to one which is concerned predominantly with central sources of information, repositioning. Gravity appears to exert an influence on position sense only when there is evidence of a direct contribution from spindles, as seen in matching and pointing. For repositioning it appears that the central influences predominate. What is unexpected is the finding that the position values derived centrally are more accurate than those which involve spindles. The concept of a central repository of position information operating independently of peripheral influences is also novel. Presumably the stored information is acquired, in part, through memories of past kinesthetic activities. To conclude, this study has raised a number of issues. Does gravity exert its influence on position sense through changes in torque levels at a joint, leading to an alteration of the joint receptor component of the position signal? If so, why is this not expressed in position sense measured by repositioning? Assuming the existence of a body schema as the central repository of spatial information, how is the communication carried out between the body periphery and central sites? Are spindles involved in this process? Given that the three methods studied here measure essentially the same thing, why are there such substantial differences in the underlying mechanisms? If we are right and repositioning operates substantially independently of peripheral sources of positional information, what is the significance of that? All of these issues will, hopefully, be addressed in future experiments.Author contributions Bernhard M.

    "abstract": "Summary Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, metadata, and sampling methods.

    "introduction": "Introduction In 1978, Vladimír Remek of the Czech Republic became the first human from the European Union to cross the boundary into outer space. Since then, astronauts from an array of European countries have followed suit (Figure 1A), with many of these trips occurring on board the International Space Station (ISS) since its first occupation at the turn of the millennium. Despite a steady increase in the number of European astronauts venturing beyond Earth (Figure 1B), astronauts remain a relatively scarce population. Each astronaut, therefore, presents a rare and unique opportunity to directly study the impact of spaceflight on the human body, mind, and spirit. Additionally, with the emergence of commercial spaceflight, and European citizens already flying to space via these programs (e.g., Axiom Mission 1 and Blue Origin NS-16), there is an emerging opportunity to expand the population of European human subjects who can be studied in space.1 The spaceflight environment is characterized by simultaneous exposure to stressors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity, isolation, and confinement within a closed environment.2 Additionally, demand on the human body changes dynamically throughout different time points within a typical spaceflight mission, including pre-flight training, launch, extravehicular activity (EVA), landing, and post-flight rehabilitation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab European astronaut population The distribution and population of European astronauts who have crossed the Kármán line (as of 9/20/21). (A) Geographically highlights the range of nationalities of European astronaut. (B) Shows the cumulative population of European astronauts over time, based on astronauts’ first mission into outer space. To date, studies of astronauts have shown that long-duration spaceflight induces multisystem physiological deconditioning, such as degradation of muscle and bone,3,4 and detrimental changes to the eye, known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).5 However, the precise mechanisms behind these responses are yet to be fully understood, largely due to the pace and practicalities of conducting comprehensive molecular studies in astronauts. Biological changes and associated medical risks during spaceflight missions, including in the commercial spaceflight setting, have recently been reviewed elsewhere.1,2,6 The European Space Agency (ESA) and other space agencies have historically taken two complementary approaches to accelerate the understanding of molecular causes of biological changes in astronauts: translational research and space analog research. Translational research utilizes model organisms, including rodents, for molecular studies in space,7 with the aim of understanding and countering detrimental physiological changes in astronauts. Space analog research utilizes facilities on Earth, which enable one to study individual aspects of the spaceflight environment without having to conduct studies in space. In the context of human research, this can include studying inactivity via bedrest studies and isolation via use of remote research stations, such as Concordia.8 At the 2022 European Space Summit, the European Association of Space Explorers called for the development of European vehicles for transporting humans into space. Irrespective of whether or not this becomes a near- to medium-term reality, not only will ESA astronauts continue to regularly fly to the ISS but also they will fly in future exploration missions with international partners. One such example is the Artemis 2 mission to the moon, which could occur as early as 2025. The new generation of spacecraft used for these missions is likely to have highly limited cargo capacity; therefore, countermeasures, such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), used on board the ISS to suppress muscle and bone loss, may not be suitable.9 Additionally, during these exploration missions, astronauts will venture beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) for the first time since the end of the Apollo program in 1972. Within LEO, the Earth’s magnetosphere provides partial protection against radiation; thus, humans venturing beyond this will experience greater exposure to solar particle event radiation and ionizing galactic cosmic radiation.2,10,11 Although there is a lack of data on the molecular effects of the beyond LEO environment, an increase in radiation-associated health risks is almost a certainty.12, 13, 14 Further considerations of future missions beyond LEO include health risks associated with unprecedentedly long-duration missions, lunar dust,15 and EVA.2 To the latter point, in the case of a Mars mission, the crew would likely need to safely perform EVA tasks in partial gravity (0.38 g) following long-duration spaceflight, without the extensive rehabilitation support available on Earth.9,16 With these new spacecraft and mission plans, it will be crucial to assess compatible countermeasures, while also gaining greater insight into the new challenges to human health posed by environments where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. A key challenge for translational research from a European standpoint is that the ESA does not currently have rodent research facilities in space, and it seems unlikely that such facilities will be rapidly developed for future exploration vehicles. Thus, new approaches that do not depend on rodent research facilities should be considered by ESA. In this context, a salient opportunity for space analog research is to harmonize measures and endpoints between research in analog environments and in space, increasing fidelity. For example, the efficacy of new countermeasures could be evaluated in both environments, and the efficacy of rehabilitation following long-duration spaceflight16 could be studied and improved by testing novel rehabilitation techniques following long-duration bedrest. For these reasons, it could prove cost effective for the ESA to pursue an approach that focuses on improved capabilities for research on astronauts themselves and with increased harmonization of data and endpoint measures obtained in space and analog environments. On Earth, medicine has undergone a revolution through the widespread generation and analysis of multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The strength of omic-based, data-driven approaches is their power to discover unanticipated effects, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and generate novel hypotheses to guide follow-up targeted studies.17,18 In scientific studies on Earth, omic-derived molecular changes are regularly correlated with performance metrics to uncover molecular drivers of physiological change.19 Omics have also become a valuable tool for clinical practice. For example, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (1) routinely offers all newborn babies blood spot test screening for several genomic-based disorders, including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism, and six inherited metabolic diseases; (2) recently launched a pilot project with Genomics to evaluate incorporating polygenic risk factor data into the clinical risk assessment for cardiovascular disease; and (3) recently approved use of personalized medications for treating cystic fibrosis based on the nature of the mutation(s) present in the patient’s cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) encoding gene. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how omics can rapidly be employed in combination with clinical data to determine risk of severe disease course, identify potential underlying mechanisms of susceptibility, and identify potential personalized treatments.20 Although omics have become a significant part of scientific research and standard clinical practice on Earth, for humans in space, omics are a relatively new and untapped technology. Between March 2015 and March 2016, NASA conducted the seminal Twins Study. The study monitored an astronaut during a 1-year mission in space, while the astronaut’s identical twin remained on Earth as a control. Both subjects were comprehensively profiled using multiomic measures across several time points pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Spaceflight-induced changes were detected across multiple systems, with most of these alterations returning to baseline levels post-flight.21 The longitudinal profiling of the NASA Twins Study and similar profiling on the recent short-duration SpaceX Inspiration4 commercial mission demonstrate that multiomics profiling of astronauts is feasible. Accordingly, NASA has recently announced that they have elected to add omics to the standard measures program for the ISS, which ESA astronauts can opt into. NASA’s standard measures program also routinely collects select physiological measures and select biomarkers from blood and urine; commercial spaceflight missions are similarly exploring these possibilities. For example, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), a partner of NASA’s Human Research Program, recently created a database for commercial spaceflight health data, including crew omics data from the Inspiration4 mission.22 It is, therefore, important that the ESA also explores these new opportunities, leveraging existing expertise in European spaceflight omics23 and facilities for human subjects research. To that end, the key question is how best to develop a routine longitudinal omics program for European astronauts and/or European spaceflight participants (SFPs). A routine omics collection program could be viewed as an initiative to develop a high-value data resource, which can be analyzed with ever-evolving big data approaches, thereby improving ESA’s artificial intelligence (AI) readiness. Access to sensitive data collected during the program would need to be controlled so that scientific research is supported, while protecting the rights of the subjects. Such a program could help to elucidate key molecular drivers behind spaceflight health issues, which could lead to improved risk quantification and approaches to spaceflight occupational health. One example of how this could be used is for the development of evidence-based recommendations on training and medical standards for spaceflight; these standards will become especially important as the spacefaring population increases in heterogeneity and begins to include humans with pre-existing conditions.1,6 Furthermore, a routine omics program could be used as a basis for personalized medicine approaches. As an example, researchers have previously found that genetic variations in one-carbon metabolism genes may contribute to susceptibility to SANS in astronauts,24 and other genomic studies have shown individual variability associated with spaceflight-relevant factors, including bone mineral density and radiation sensitivity.1 Pre-flight genomic screening of astronauts, therefore, holds potential in developing personalized medicine approaches to risk assessment and countermeasures, including pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics.17,25,26 Pharmacogenomics aims to optimize medication therapy, with respect to the patient’s genomic data, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. For example, a study of medication on board the ISS found that the metabolism of approximately a third of the drugs in the ISS repository were affected by polymorphic metabolizing enzymes.27 Through further data collection, cargo could potentially be optimized to only include the best available medication for the individual crewmembers, reducing costs and adverse drug reaction/therapy failure risk.28 Furthermore, omics could prove valuable for longitudinal health monitoring during spaceflight. For example, TRISH recently suggested that omics could be used alongside other datasets obtained via point-of-care (POC) devices to diagnose approximately one-third of NASA’s list of medical conditions that are of concern for deep-space missions.29 Finally, discoveries obtained using human-research-derived omics data could benefit health on Earth. For example, the World Health Organization has listed physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, estimated to have been responsible for 9% of global premature mortality in 2008.30 Mechanical unloading of the musculoskeletal system due to microgravity during spaceflight, or due to immobilization or reduced step count in analog environments, induces similar effects to physical inactivity, such as muscle atrophy and altered glucose handling; thus, discoveries and countermeasures developed for astronauts and/or SFPs could prove useful for terrestrial efforts against physical inactivity.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions Humanity has laid ambitious plans to venture to Mars and establish settlements on other planetary bodies, and commercial spaceflight is gaining rapid traction with the spacefaring population set to quickly increase both in terms of size and diversity. These new endeavors present new challenges for human health in space. Crucially, more data are needed, especially for environmental conditions beyond LEO, where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. Recently the first multiomic profiling studies of astronauts have been performed in the NASA Twins and SpaceX Inspiration4 missions. With their feasibility for spaceflight now demonstrated, these biological big data approaches are primed to transform our understanding of health in space, as they have for health on Earth. Importantly, in addition to elucidating mechanistic understanding of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning, these approaches also hold strong potential to improve risk quantification and occupational health in space, such as through the design and deployment of personalized medicine approaches. Thus, routinely applying these same approaches to European human subjects, including participants in analog environments and astronauts and/or SFPs in spaceflight missions, is a golden opportunity. In order to achieve the full potential of these big data approaches, several challenges need to be addressed in a cohesive European fashion. First, how do we best store and ensure collected data are AI ready? Second, which datasets should we collect and when? Third, how do we enable open science approaches while protecting personal data? Although we have introduced the challenges and proposed some options, it is important to achieve European consensus on these questions (Table 1). We propose forming an ESA topical team and/or holding an ESA workshop as a strategic way forward. The goal is to bring together European human omics/data science researchers and human subject researchers to address these questions in coordination with ESA and stakeholders from the commercial spaceflight sector. Importantly, this consensus will need to consider the international context of human research on the ISS, the commercial aspects of data science, and the personal nature of the data. These latter aspects could be achieved via collaboration with organizations, such as International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP), HRMRB, and TRISH. Table 1.

Copyright notice ID: 9583032 PMID: 36277820 Summary Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, metadata, and sampling methods.

Improved occupational healthcare will be important for reducing risk and increasing mission success in ambitious endeavors, including voyages to Mars. We believe that collaborative steps should be taken today to design a standardized data resource, which will continue to be useful in the future, as data science approaches evolve. From this perspective, we introduce considerations for a routine omics program for Europeans in space. These include which data types to collect, which sampling methods to use, and at which time points. Ethical and legal considerations of European personal omics data in the context of astronauts are also discussed, with the goal of creating a policy landscape where data can be as open as possible to maximize scientific potential but as closed as necessary to protect the data subjects. We propose that routine “omic” collection (e.g., pre-flight genomic sequencing) from European government or commercial astronauts could provide valuable data for understanding spaceflight-induced health issues. Building such a standardized data resource would help to unlock powerful data science approaches. This could improve occupational healthcare in spaceflight, including via personalized medicine approaches. We introduce considerations, including ethical and legal challenges regarding European human personal data, in the unique context of the spacefaring population and which samples to collect and when.Introduction In 1978, Vladimír Remek of the Czech Republic became the first human from the European Union to cross the boundary into outer space. Since then, astronauts from an array of European countries have followed suit (Figure 1A), with many of these trips occurring on board the International Space Station (ISS) since its first occupation at the turn of the millennium. Despite a steady increase in the number of European astronauts venturing beyond Earth (Figure 1B), astronauts remain a relatively scarce population. Each astronaut, therefore, presents a rare and unique opportunity to directly study the impact of spaceflight on the human body, mind, and spirit. Additionally, with the emergence of commercial spaceflight, and European citizens already flying to space via these programs (e.g., Axiom Mission 1 and Blue Origin NS-16), there is an emerging opportunity to expand the population of European human subjects who can be studied in space.1 The spaceflight environment is characterized by simultaneous exposure to stressors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity, isolation, and confinement within a closed environment.2 Additionally, demand on the human body changes dynamically throughout different time points within a typical spaceflight mission, including pre-flight training, launch, extravehicular activity (EVA), landing, and post-flight rehabilitation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab European astronaut population The distribution and population of European astronauts who have crossed the Kármán line (as of 9/20/21). (A) Geographically highlights the range of nationalities of European astronaut. (B) Shows the cumulative population of European astronauts over time, based on astronauts’ first mission into outer space.To date, studies of astronauts have shown that long-duration spaceflight induces multisystem physiological deconditioning, such as degradation of muscle and bone,3,4 and detrimental changes to the eye, known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).5 However, the precise mechanisms behind these responses are yet to be fully understood, largely due to the pace and practicalities of conducting comprehensive molecular studies in astronauts. Biological changes and associated medical risks during spaceflight missions, including in the commercial spaceflight setting, have recently been reviewed elsewhere.1,2,6 The European Space Agency (ESA) and other space agencies have historically taken two complementary approaches to accelerate the understanding of molecular causes of biological changes in astronauts: translational research and space analog research. Translational research utilizes model organisms, including rodents, for molecular studies in space,7 with the aim of understanding and countering detrimental physiological changes in astronauts. Space analog research utilizes facilities on Earth, which enable one to study individual aspects of the spaceflight environment without having to conduct studies in space. In the context of human research, this can include studying inactivity via bedrest studies and isolation via use of remote research stations, such as Concordia.8 At the 2022 European Space Summit, the European Association of Space Explorers called for the development of European vehicles for transporting humans into space. Irrespective of whether or not this becomes a near- to medium-term reality, not only will ESA astronauts continue to regularly fly to the ISS but also they will fly in future exploration missions with international partners. One such example is the Artemis 2 mission to the moon, which could occur as early as 2025. The new generation of spacecraft used for these missions is likely to have highly limited cargo capacity; therefore, countermeasures, such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), used on board the ISS to suppress muscle and bone loss, may not be suitable.9 Additionally, during these exploration missions, astronauts will venture beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) for the first time since the end of the Apollo program in 1972. Within LEO, the Earth’s magnetosphere provides partial protection against radiation; thus, humans venturing beyond this will experience greater exposure to solar particle event radiation and ionizing galactic cosmic radiation.2,10,11 Although there is a lack of data on the molecular effects of the beyond LEO environment, an increase in radiation-associated health risks is almost a certainty.12, 13, 14 Further considerations of future missions beyond LEO include health risks associated with unprecedentedly long-duration missions, lunar dust,15 and EVA.2 To the latter point, in the case of a Mars mission, the crew would likely need to safely perform EVA tasks in partial gravity (0.38 g) following long-duration spaceflight, without the extensive rehabilitation support available on Earth.9,16 With these new spacecraft and mission plans, it will be crucial to assess compatible countermeasures, while also gaining greater insight into the new challenges to human health posed by environments where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. A key challenge for translational research from a European standpoint is that the ESA does not currently have rodent research facilities in space, and it seems unlikely that such facilities will be rapidly developed for future exploration vehicles. Thus, new approaches that do not depend on rodent research facilities should be considered by ESA. In this context, a salient opportunity for space analog research is to harmonize measures and endpoints between research in analog environments and in space, increasing fidelity. For example, the efficacy of new countermeasures could be evaluated in both environments, and the efficacy of rehabilitation following long-duration spaceflight16 could be studied and improved by testing novel rehabilitation techniques following long-duration bedrest. For these reasons, it could prove cost effective for the ESA to pursue an approach that focuses on improved capabilities for research on astronauts themselves and with increased harmonization of data and endpoint measures obtained in space and analog environments. On Earth, medicine has undergone a revolution through the widespread generation and analysis of multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The strength of omic-based, data-driven approaches is their power to discover unanticipated effects, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and generate novel hypotheses to guide follow-up targeted studies.17,18 In scientific studies on Earth, omic-derived molecular changes are regularly correlated with performance metrics to uncover molecular drivers of physiological change.19 Omics have also become a valuable tool for clinical practice. For example, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (1) routinely offers all newborn babies blood spot test screening for several genomic-based disorders, including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism, and six inherited metabolic diseases; (2) recently launched a pilot project with Genomics to evaluate incorporating polygenic risk factor data into the clinical risk assessment for cardiovascular disease; and (3) recently approved use of personalized medications for treating cystic fibrosis based on the nature of the mutation(s) present in the patient’s cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) encoding gene. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how omics can rapidly be employed in combination with clinical data to determine risk of severe disease course, identify potential underlying mechanisms of susceptibility, and identify potential personalized treatments.20 Although omics have become a significant part of scientific research and standard clinical practice on Earth, for humans in space, omics are a relatively new and untapped technology. Between March 2015 and March 2016, NASA conducted the seminal Twins Study. The study monitored an astronaut during a 1-year mission in space, while the astronaut’s identical twin remained on Earth as a control. Both subjects were comprehensively profiled using multiomic measures across several time points pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Spaceflight-induced changes were detected across multiple systems, with most of these alterations returning to baseline levels post-flight.21 The longitudinal profiling of the NASA Twins Study and similar profiling on the recent short-duration SpaceX Inspiration4 commercial mission demonstrate that multiomics profiling of astronauts is feasible. Accordingly, NASA has recently announced that they have elected to add omics to the standard measures program for the ISS, which ESA astronauts can opt into. NASA’s standard measures program also routinely collects select physiological measures and select biomarkers from blood and urine; commercial spaceflight missions are similarly exploring these possibilities. For example, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), a partner of NASA’s Human Research Program, recently created a database for commercial spaceflight health data, including crew omics data from the Inspiration4 mission.22 It is, therefore, important that the ESA also explores these new opportunities, leveraging existing expertise in European spaceflight omics23 and facilities for human subjects research. To that end, the key question is how best to develop a routine longitudinal omics program for European astronauts and/or European spaceflight participants (SFPs). A routine omics collection program could be viewed as an initiative to develop a high-value data resource, which can be analyzed with ever-evolving big data approaches, thereby improving ESA’s artificial intelligence (AI) readiness. Access to sensitive data collected during the program would need to be controlled so that scientific research is supported, while protecting the rights of the subjects. Such a program could help to elucidate key molecular drivers behind spaceflight health issues, which could lead to improved risk quantification and approaches to spaceflight occupational health. One example of how this could be used is for the development of evidence-based recommendations on training and medical standards for spaceflight; these standards will become especially important as the spacefaring population increases in heterogeneity and begins to include humans with pre-existing conditions.1,6 Furthermore, a routine omics program could be used as a basis for personalized medicine approaches. As an example, researchers have previously found that genetic variations in one-carbon metabolism genes may contribute to susceptibility to SANS in astronauts,24 and other genomic studies have shown individual variability associated with spaceflight-relevant factors, including bone mineral density and radiation sensitivity.1 Pre-flight genomic screening of astronauts, therefore, holds potential in developing personalized medicine approaches to risk assessment and countermeasures, including pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics.17,25,26 Pharmacogenomics aims to optimize medication therapy, with respect to the patient’s genomic data, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. For example, a study of medication on board the ISS found that the metabolism of approximately a third of the drugs in the ISS repository were affected by polymorphic metabolizing enzymes.27 Through further data collection, cargo could potentially be optimized to only include the best available medication for the individual crewmembers, reducing costs and adverse drug reaction/therapy failure risk.28 Furthermore, omics could prove valuable for longitudinal health monitoring during spaceflight. For example, TRISH recently suggested that omics could be used alongside other datasets obtained via point-of-care (POC) devices to diagnose approximately one-third of NASA’s list of medical conditions that are of concern for deep-space missions.29 Finally, discoveries obtained using human-research-derived omics data could benefit health on Earth. For example, the World Health Organization has listed physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, estimated to have been responsible for 9% of global premature mortality in 2008.30 Mechanical unloading of the musculoskeletal system due to microgravity during spaceflight, or due to immobilization or reduced step count in analog environments, induces similar effects to physical inactivity, such as muscle atrophy and altered glucose handling; thus, discoveries and countermeasures developed for astronauts and/or SFPs could prove useful for terrestrial efforts against physical inactivity.Considerations for a European space research routine omics program Designing an appropriate routine omics collection program for European astronauts and/or SFPs requires careful consideration of a number of factors. In this section, we discuss some of the key considerations, including collecting data with AI in mind, which sampling methods and omics data types should be collected based on practicality and perceived scientific return, and which ethical and legal challenges may need to be addressed. AI readiness of omics data and metadata Collecting the same standardized measures routinely from astronauts and/or SFPs across multiple missions would greatly improve the AI readiness of the generated datasets, especially when combined with accompanying standardized metadata, including spacecraft environmental measures (e.g., radiation dosimetry).7,31 One important practical consideration here will be digital storage requirements, because omics experiments generate large volumes of data. Similarly, harmonizing approaches with other space agencies will be important. In this context, there is an opportunity for the ESA to expand collaboration with the Frontier Development Lab, which it currently partners with to assist with AI approaches to Earth Observation and that is also currently partnered with NASA to assist with AI approaches across the entire Science Mission Directorate. In pursuit of AI readiness, it will be important to adhere to guidelines, such as well-implemented FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles where possible,32,33 which could include machine-interpretable file formats, such as standardized processed omic data,18,34 alongside raw data and metadata. In order to further enhance the quantity of data, identical measures could be collected from well-designed, ground-based analog studies, to facilitate comparison and to unlock powerful machine learning (ML) techniques based on transfer learning. With the ever-increasing adoption and utility of AI-based approaches for healthcare and life sciences research,35 the importance of designing data collection and curation with AI capabilities in mind cannot be overstated. For example, it may eventually be possible to develop omic-based digital twin approaches to be used in applications, such as mission planning and countermeasure design. These approaches could model the physiological impact that mission parameters, such as duration and radiation exposure, may have on individual astronauts.36,37 Although there are a few interesting exceptions, at present, most AI approaches require large volumes of high-quality and domain-relevant training data.38, 39, 40 Notably, robust population-based analyses will be particularly challenging to achieve for humans in space, given their rarity. It is, therefore, important to initiate collection and curation of standardized astronaut and/or SFP omics data and metadata as soon as possible, thereby unlocking a future of powerful AI-based omic analyses for personalized medicine approaches and mechanistic discovery.Omic data types A key consideration for implementing a routine omics program will be selecting a panel of omic assays to capture from human subjects. Omics is increasingly being used as shorthand for big data approaches in biology and medicine, with numerous different omic data types and technologies now available at decreasing costs. Different omics data types and technologies offer both overlapping and unique insights into molecular changes within the body.18 Integrating multiple omic types (i.e., “multiomics”) via systems biology approaches can lead to a more holistic picture of spaceflight-associated molecular patterns.41 Initial multiomics studies during the NASA Twins mission and SpaceX Inspiration4 mission have opted for a relatively broad approach to assay selection.21 It makes sense to use findings from these missions to optimize a panel of assays for routine omics. This harmonized approach would also support comparability between data captured via a European routine omics program and these initial international studies. To further support comparability, it also seems logical to collect data types that are prevalent in large-scale terrestrial omic initiatives, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and the European Genome-phenome Archive. The ability to easily compare astronaut data with terrestrial disease cohorts could allow for the identification of similar patterns, which could aid processes, such as countermeasure design (e.g., omic-based drug repurposing).42 While collecting the same measures over a long period of time is desirable, some flexibility is to be expected due to the continued evolution of omic technologies. Although coverage of all potential omic types and technologies is beyond the scope of this article, there are a few clear candidates worth noting. The most immediately actionable and cost-effective measure in terms of healthcare will likely be pre-flight genomic screening,43 such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS). For example, a recent proof-of-concept study by the Mayo Clinic found that pre-emptive use of basic pharmacogenomic testing, alongside participants’ medication history, enabled pharmacists to offer medication improvement opportunities in 56% of participants.44 Some of the medications involved in the study (e.g., ondansetron, metoprolol, aripiprazole, sertraline, and phenytoin) have been documented as being part of the ISS medication kit.27 Thus, pre-flight genomic screening could potentially be used to inform medication management and personalized medicine approaches to spaceflight countermeasures.25 Similarly, microbiomic approaches, such as studying the genomic makeup of microbial communities via metagenomics, are likely to have high clinical relevance for humans in space. Metagenomic analyses of crew samples can be used to study microbiome shifts2 and potential health consequences, such as viral (e.g., herpes) reactivation and skin rashes;45,46 the addition of environmental samples to study microbial interactions between crew members and the spacecraft environment would also be useful for monitoring crew health (e.g., infectious disease management).47,48 On board the ISS, at least some coverage of metagenomics would likely fall under NASA’s microbial monitoring program. Other candidate omic data types for studying regulatory molecular changes, discovering biomarkers, and designing interventions for spaceflight-associated health risks include transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics18 (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Incorporating omics into astronaut studies Overview of how candidate omic data types for studying and counteracting astronaut health risks interact with one another, the environment, and phenotype. Epigenomics is shown to span several omic data types to demonstrate that environmental exposures and activity occurring at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels influence epigenomic status. Adapted from Yu et al.49 under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Sampling time points Due to the dynamic nature of physiological changes throughout the course of a typical spaceflight mission, it is scientifically meaningful to acquire omic measures across an array of time points. At a minimum, a sampling point just before flight and a sampling point taken shortly after the mission would prove useful for quantifying the molecular impact of the spaceflight mission. However, averaging multiple pre-flight measures would be valuable for establishing a robust molecular baseline, and multiple post-flight measures would prove useful for studying recovery and long-term health. To the latter point, long-term (i.e., “lifetime”) post-flight time points will be particularly valuable for missions beyond LEO, to study whether the human body fully recovers from spaceflight environmental factors, such as DNA damage response following the increased radiation dosage. To that point, it has recently been reported, albeit in a single pair of monozygotic twin astronauts, that onset of clonal hematopoiesis may be influenced by spaceflight.50 Clonal hematopoiesis results in lifelong changes in the blood that are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and blood cancers. The addition of in-flight measures, particularly for long-duration missions, would provide greater temporal resolution, allowing for spaceflight-induced molecular changes to be monitored over time. As a starting point, it may make sense to focus time points around expected points of significant physiological change, especially when clinically relevant. Significant physiological changes can occur rapidly, so early in-flight time points could be useful for studying their onset. For example, the first in-flight time point for the NASA Twins Study was at 14 days into the flight,21 whereas spaceflight research has indicated that significant physiological changes can occur before this point and, thus, earlier time points may be valuable. For instance, a recent study investigating anemia in astronauts collected blood and exhaled air samples at 5 ± 1 days into the 6-month flights and results already indicated significantly increased breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis). Markers for increased hemolysis persisted throughout the in-flight time points (11 ± 1, 64 ± 5, and 157 ± 31 days), with 5 of 13 astronauts reaching clinical levels of anemia when measured 4 ± 1 days after landing.51 The potential implication that the longer the duration in space, the worse certain health risks, including anemia, suggests that in-flight time points across the full duration of spaceflight missions may be valuable. For example, other useful in-flight time points may include shortly before the end of the flight, so that this can be compared with the first post-flight time point to measure the impact of landing and initial readaptation, and shortly before and after EVA, to investigate the molecular impact of such events. The sampling schedule also has implications for occupational health. For example, pre-flight omic measures could be used as a baseline for personalized medicine approaches. Measures taken in flight across different time points could then eventually be compared with the baseline data with ML approaches to predict health outcomes and suggest preventative interventions.37,52 Insights related to the molecular impact of mission events, such as EVA, could also be used to inform mission design, or indeed day-to-day task scheduling to manage stress responses. While frequent sample time points are desirable, it will be important to balance the sampling schedule with regard to practical considerations, including cost, use of crew time, sample storage space, and subject recovery time (dependent on sample invasiveness). Additionally, if in-flight time points are included in the sampling schedule, it will be important to thoroughly train crew members for successful sample collection.Accompanying functional measures It is beneficial to routinely collect performance measures in tandem with omics, such as self-assessments (e.g., cognition, nutrition, and sleep quality), exercise outputs, and physiological measures collected from wearables and POC devices.29,53 When combined, omic and functional measures can be used to infer causal molecular-phenotypic links, which can then be used to inform and test interventions and discover novel biomarkers; if adopted, this approach would be a major advance in research capabilities, enabling widespread hypothesis-driven molecular mechanistic research to be conducted in astronauts. While outside the scope of this omic-focused article, the choice of which performance measures to collect must also be considered via an evidence-based approach, balancing scientific and clinical value with considerations regarding practicality, such as levels of invasiveness. Importantly, NASA’s standard measures program, which ESA astronauts can opt into, currently captures a curated selection of standardized functional measures from astronauts on the ISS.Sample processing One practical consideration regarding routine omics collection is the logistics of processing the samples. Currently, human biological samples collected on the ISS are typically preserved (e.g., via rapid freezing) and stored before being returned to Earth for sequencing and analysis. The multiomics profiling conducted for the NASA Twins Study shows that this model is feasible for longitudinal human studies on the ISS,21 yet the approach does come with some disadvantages, including sample degradation, delays in receiving results, and dependence on freezer space. Thus, while this approach with well-designed procedures for sample processing7 is likely to be appropriate for routine omics on the ISS, future commercial space stations, and short-duration missions, it may not be appropriate for all mission types. Therefore, at least for long-duration exploration missions, it may make sense to move toward an approach with reduced reliance on sample return to Earth. One step toward enabling this in-flight autonomy is improving in-flight equipment capabilities, which has been demonstrated recently via usage of the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer on board the ISS for sequencing DNA54 and even human-derived RNA directly (Sarah Castro-Wallace, personal communication). Using this equipment, environmental swabs have been collected in-flight and then processed and sequenced on board (swab-to-sequence).47,55 As the technology becomes more compact and lightweight, autonomy of the sample processing may improve further still through robotic automation of spaceflight laboratories.56 One consideration is that in-flight generation of omics data presents challenges regarding data storage and transfer back to Earth. Importantly, downlink challenges compound with the communication delays introduced by increasing distance from Earth. In-flight computational processing of raw omics data can mitigate this issue by significantly reducing file size, and full-analysis pipelines have even been executed on-orbit, eradicating the need to downlink data to obtain results (Sarah Castro-Wallace, personal communication). Importantly, in-flight processing of omics data has implications for occupational health in space. For example, in the context of NASA’s microbial monitoring program, in-flight processing can enable crew health to be monitored (e.g., infectious disease diagnosis) in near real time.47,55 As another use case, results obtained in-flight could eventually be inputted directly into AI models, such as clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), to inform the decisions of onboard medical officers in the event that the healthcare support teams on Earth cannot be contacted.Sampling methods for spaceflight omics collection Below, we introduce various biospecimens and sampling methods for omics data collection (Figure 3). We focus on approaches that have spaceflight heritage. Figure 3.

Thus, while biopsies present the gold standard for molecular profiling of human physiology, such procedures are invasive in nature, require specialized expertise, are often characterized by localized pain, and naturally carry an increased risk of infection. It is no surprise, therefore, that routine tissue biopsy sampling of astronauts in-flight is lacking, and omic studies in this sense remain constrained to those of cultured human cells flown to space—examples include transcriptomics and/or proteomics of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes57 and human intestinal epithelial cells.58 Given the inherent challenges of human tissue biopsy sampling in space, routine omics data collection from astronauts via this tool is most immediately likely through regular sampling programs pre- and post-flight, particularly for more readily extractable tissue types, such as skin and skeletal muscle. Indeed, in the case of the latter, muscle biopsies have previously been obtained from astronauts post- versus pre-flight to infer human skeletal muscle functional, morphological, biochemical, and, more recently, proteomic changes in space.3,59, 60, 61 With the application of various omic techniques (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc.) to biopsied skeletal muscle now being commonplace in terrestrial human physiology research, future multiomic analyses of astronaut muscle (and outwardly skin) obtained pre- and post-flight are entirely plausible. The existence of less-invasive (microbiopsy) techniques for sampling skeletal muscle62 and skin63 could make routine collection of these tissue types from astronauts during flight a realistic future prospect. In terms of a more immediate scientific return, omics collection via tissue biopsy thus lends itself as a promising tool for better understanding molecular determinants of skeletal muscle and skin responses to the spaceflight environment.Blood As a minimally invasive procedure, blood sampling has long been used as a primary alternative to tissue biopsies (i.e., “liquid biopsy) for molecular characterization of human health on Earth. Given the clear technical and operational advantages of blood versus tissue sampling in the spaceflight environment, blood sampling currently appears to be more viable for longitudinal monitoring of astronaut responses at the molecular level, particularly in flight. Blood samples are thus often collected from astronauts for analyses on Earth, and targeted molecular profiling of astronaut blood obtained before, during, and/or after spaceflight has subsequently been performed on numerous occasions, with particular emphasis on spaceflight-induced immune system dysregulation.64, 65, 66, 67 Additionally, comprehensive analyses of astronaut blood samples from the NASA Twins Study have yielded several new and important insights. For instance, initial multiomic (epigenomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic) analyses revealed wholesale gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and metabolite changes in plasma during spaceflight that were largely normalized upon return to Earth.21 Additional plasma proteomic profiling also uncovered patient-specific exosome protein signatures following the mission,68 with these blood samples also proving useful toward confirming human relevance of findings derived from omic analysis in model organisms.69 Other independent studies have also explored plasma metabolomic or proteomic changes in astronauts following long-term spaceflight exposure.3,70,71 Routine longitudinal multiomics of astronaut blood is thus firmly within reach. As the number of available samples across astronauts and time points continues to grow, blood omics therefore holds accelerated potential to expedite molecular understanding of human spaceflight responses in areas such as immune system dysregulation.Urine and stool Both normal human waste products that can be cheaply, frequently, and non-invasively sampled without specialized equipment or skill, urine, and stool (feces) naturally present themselves as strong candidate sample types for routine, longitudinal astronaut omics collection. Indeed, alongside blood, urine is a common form of liquid biopsy for terrestrial biomonitoring of humans, and can be used to screen for a variety of different (patho)physiological biomarkers (renal, cardiac, prostate, bone, etc.).72, 73, 74 However, unlike blood, urine is absent of a homeostatic mechanism and can, therefore, retain/accommodate more substances that reflect changes produced in vivo, while its low complexity lends itself to straightforward detection of low-abundance proteins.75 As such, urine may be considered as better suited for early-stage biomonitoring, particularly in terms of the kidneys.75,76 Astronaut urine omics is consequently starting to grow, with several recent studies demonstrating the multiomic (namely metabolomic and proteomic) potential of this sample type for gaining new information on human body adaptations following spaceflight.21,72,77,78 For instance, metabolomic/proteomic analyses of urine from the NASA Twins Study revealed urinary excretion of COL1A1 and COL3A1 as potential biomarkers of muscle, tendon, or bone changes during spaceflight.21 Cardiovascular-related urine proteome changes, including some associated with autonomic regulation of heart rate, have also been delineated, offering several promising urine biomarkers for screening cardiovascular responses to spaceflight.77,78 On Earth, stool has become a primary sample choice for metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome, which plays a critical role in the internal environment and concomitantly (patho)physiological state of an individual.79, 80, 81 Recognition is now also growing for a potential role of the gut microbiome toward physiological maladaptation of astronauts during spaceflight.82 Metagenomic studies of astronaut stool have thus gained traction, demonstrating spaceflight-induced alterations in both the composition and function of an astronaut’s gut microbiome,45,83 as well as uncovering genetic and immunological evidence for transfer of environmental strains to an astronaut’s gut microbiome on board the ISS.84 Thus, astronaut stool (and outwardly other samples; see below) metagenomics can serve as a useful tool not only for guiding continual health monitoring but also mission planning and habitat design.84 Future omic studies of astronaut stool would perhaps benefit from complementary metabolomics in order to improve functional readout of gut microbiome activity.85 In closing, it appears clear that stool and urine analyses could prove practical for routine astronaut omics collection, with strong potential for rapid scientific return.Saliva and body swabs While a potent contributor, the human microbiome is not merely defined by the gut but rather the full complement of microbes (and their genes) that reside on or within the host. These microbes interact together alongside host genetics and the environment to contribute toward an individual’s health state.86, 87, 88, 89, 90 Wider-ranging microbiome understanding in space is thus essential for biomonitoring astronaut health and, as noted above, other factors, such as habitat design. Indeed, the ISS is a unique closed environment with rich microbial diversity91, 92, 93, 94 which, combined with possible influx and outflow of microorganisms at times of spacecraft exchange,48 may hold potential to have an impact on astronaut health. In terms of spaceflight, saliva, nose, and mouth/buccal samples present alongside stool as useful for providing insight on astronaut health and physiological conditions, whereas skin and the ear are prime sampling sites to explore interactions between an astronaut and the spaceflight environment.95 Importantly, routine, longitudinal metagenomics collection from all these locations is a highly feasible prospect in the context of spaceflight, since all are readily accessible for frequent non-invasive sampling via swab (or spit sample, in the case of saliva) at little cost or time expense and without the need for specialized skill. Demonstrating the associated scientific potential are several other recent metagenomic studies of astronauts, revealing new information on host- and site-(in)dependent microbiome responses across these various locations during spaceflight as well as microbial transmission between the astronauts and the ISS surface and vice versa.45,46,48,95,96 Thus, as complementary to stool, metagenomics collection from saliva and body swabs should serve as a strong tool for better understanding molecular determinants of astronaut health in the immediate future.Hair While perhaps an intriguing sample choice to note on face value, hair as a source for omics collection may represent a useful complementary source for routine biomonitoring of human physiological responses to spaceflight. Indeed, hair is readily available and easily sampled via extraction of hair follicles, requiring no specific personal expertise nor complex hardware.97,98 Moreover, hair cells can reflect host physical conditions, including human peripheral circadian clock and organismal metabolic responses to environmental changes.98 Omic studies of astronaut hair are thus beginning to emerge. Notably, a seminal study by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) conducted transcriptomics on astronaut hair follicles collected before, during, and after 6 months of spaceflight.99 Although several markers of hair growth were unsurprisingly dysregulated during flight, interestingly, hair PCDH8 was derived as a potential biomarker for astronaut neurochemical changes in the space environment.99 Terrestrial studies of human hair also span other omic lines (e.g., proteomics and metabolomics),100,101 highlighting the potential for multiomic profiling of astronaut hair samples. Nevertheless, the extent to which various physiological responses to spaceflight can be tracked by biomarkers in hair warrants a better understanding, before the true scientific potential of hair omics toward biomonitoring astronaut health can be established.Breath A final sample type worthy of note when it comes to astronaut omics collection is breath. Indeed, molecular analysis of exhaled breath is rapidly emerging as a useful tool on Earth for biomonitoring of an individual in health and disease (“breath-print”), both at the level of the lung as well as other vital organs via systemic circulation (e.g., the heart).102,103 Exhaled breath analysis is plausibly suited to the spaceflight environment, as samples can be acquired frequently in a non-invasive manner, with relative ease and at little expense.102 Moreover, for certain omic types, such as proteomics, exhaled breath condensate may be better suited for rapid analysis versus other forms of liquid biopsy, such as blood and urine.104 Nevertheless, omic studies of astronaut breath remain very much in their infancy. In one of the only studies to date,104 proteomic analysis of exhaled breath condensate obtained from cosmonauts before and after long-term spaceflight revealed strong enrichment for proteins involved in keratinization and pathogenic E. coli infection, offering support to the potential utility of breath analysis for non-invasive monitoring of astronaut health and respiratory tract pathology.104 On Earth, metabolomic study of human exhaled air (“breathomics”) has also proven to be highly feasible and consequently gained great traction,105 though transcriptomic studies are currently lacking, perhaps owing to poor knowledge of present mRNAs due to high fragmentation of RNA isolated from exhaled breath condensate.106 Nonetheless, sample collection advantages coupled with multiomic potential106 make exhaled breath a highly promising complementary source for molecular profiling of astronaut health, particularly with respect to the respiratory system.Ethical and legal considerations for human space omics In this section, the ethical challenges and legislative landscape within Europe will be considered in the context of astronaut and SFP-derived omics data. Focus is given to harmonious laws across Europe, but it should be acknowledged that national laws and the involvement of non-European law, via multinational entities (e.g., commercial spaceflight companies) and international collaborations, can introduce further complexities. Ultimately, legislation aims to find a balance between supporting scientific research and healthcare while protecting participants from harm; data should be as open as possible in order to facilitate further analysis and as protected as necessary for the participants donating data. We intend to summarize these ethical and legal frameworks to encourage productive development of policies pertaining to human space omics research, which could eventually cover biobanking and controlled utilization of omics data. When are data personal? In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) came into force in the European Union. The regulation aims to enhance individuals’ control over their data. The impact of the GDPR on omics in healthcare and research has recently been reviewed in a detailed report by the PHG Foundation.107 Article 3(1) of the GDPR states that “This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not.” Therefore, a routine omics program for the ESA would most likely fall within the territorial scope of the GDPR, but importantly this is only the case if the data are deemed to be personal data. From the definition of personal data in Article 4(1) and Recital 26 of the GDPR, it would seem apparent that omics data could be considered to be personal data if they are deemed reasonably likely to be either directly or indirectly identifiable. Hypothetically, if a database contains solely omics with all other identifiers removed, additional information would be needed to indirectly identify the natural person from whom the data are derived. This process is sometimes referred to as a linkage attack. Holding some similarity to rare disease cohorts,108, 109, 110 astronauts and SFPs are currently a small population of public figures. Consequently, information, including mission status, and phenotypic information, such as hair color, height, and sex, pertaining to individuals are readily available to the public. It could, therefore, be possible to link astronauts’ or SFPs’ omic data to this additional information in order to identify individuals.111 However, an important caveat is that different omics data types have different levels of identifiability when combined with phenotypic information, meaning that some will qualify as personal data while others do not. Omics describing the unique DNA sequence of individuals, such as SNPs, are generally regarded as having the highest level of identifiability. Traits, including eye color, skin color, and sex, are considered simple to accurately predict from data sources, such as WGS.112 Thus, in the unique context of spaceflight cohorts, such data types would likely be classed as personal data. However, the identifiability of other omics types, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, is also an emerging area of research.113, 114, 115, 116 Furthermore, the generation of multiomics datasets adds an additional layer of complexity because there could be relationships between the different omic types that increase the overall likelihood of identification.117 Additionally, raw data hold increased potential for identification compared with processed data, so file formats are an important consideration for appropriate data dissemination. Finally, aggregated data, which combine datasets from a population of individuals (e.g., to produce an average value), can reduce identifiability. However, aggregated approaches can significantly reduce utility for research into individual differences associated with spaceflight-induced biological changes and, therefore, utility in personalized medicine approaches. It is also worth mentioning that the familial element of some omic data types means that if it is deemed reasonably likely for someone to identify a family member from the astronaut or SFP’s personal omics data, then it would also be classified as that family member’s personal data, so their rights may also be brought into consideration.Approval for data collection and processing When it comes to navigating the ethics of conducting human research studies in Europe, there are several prominent non-legal binding instruments, including the Declaration of Helsinki, which was first formulated in 1964, with several subsequent revisions.118 These instruments have introduced key concepts that have become encoded within national laws and regulations across Europe. Two of the primary concepts are independent ethical review committees and informed consent. First, all research collecting omics data from human subjects must gain approval from an independent ethical review committee before the research can commence. The committee consists of a panel of experts, who provide oversight for human research, ensuring that the research is conducted in agreement with internationally and locally accepted ethical guidelines and in compliance with the law. In cases of data derived from ESA astronauts flying on missions with international collaborators, approval will likely need to be granted by international ethics committees in addition to European committees. For example, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) exists for overseeing human research on the ISS, with board members from the international partners. As part of addressing the ethical review committees, investigators would be expected to demonstrate collection of informed consent from all study participants. Prior to providing such consent, participants should be clearly informed of the research purpose, experimental and data handling procedures, the potential risks, and their right to withdraw from the study at any time. As mentioned in the previous section, utility of omics is ever-increasing with the true capability and, by consequence, identifiability, of omics yet to be unlocked. This landscape of unknowns makes informed consent difficult to meaningfully define, particularly when research is not necessarily hypothesis driven, as is the case with the longitudinal omics collection program proposed in this article. In this context, broad consent has emerged in law (e.g., GDPR Recital 33) and practice as a potential means of obtaining consent for collecting omics for use in unspecified future research projects, including biobanking.119 Notably, however, in the United States, broad consent was used in the recent multiomics profiling study onboard the commercial SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, to gain consent from the crew for the archiving and future use of their samples and data for space health research.22 In order for processing to be permitted, European space omics data that are deemed to be personal data must satisfy a legal basis pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR. In the context of space agencies or commercial companies, several of the reasons enumerated in Article 6 could prove relevant. To paraphrase, relevant bases may include (1) consent, (2) performance of a contract, and (3) public interest. However, omics personal data would also be considered special category data within the GDPR, either under the classification of genetic data or data concerning health, in Article 4 and Recitals 34 and 35.120 Article 9 states that such data types cannot be processed unless at least one of ten exceptions applies. To summarize, potentially relevant exceptions include (1) explicit consent, (2) the data subject making their data public, (3) medical purposes, and (4) archiving scientific data in the public interest. Ultimately, the restrictions on processing imposed by Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR require careful consideration in the context of a space agency or commercial company processing astronaut or SFP personal omics data. There are many interesting angles to consider based on space agencies’ multifaceted roles as research institutions, government agencies, employers, and primary care providers for astronauts121 and the societal role of spaceflight. To the latter point, the United Nations’ Outer Space Treaty of 1967—considered to be the backbone of international space law—states that astronauts should be regarded as “envoys of mankind.” The advent of commercial spaceflight missions adds additional considerations, especially due to the variety of mission types with varying degrees of scientific value.Ethical issues pertaining to data usage A key ethical challenge involved in omics research is the handling of incidental findings in consideration of duty of care. Analysis of astronaut or SFP-derived omics could reveal pertinent findings, such as gene mutations associated with increased SANS risk; however, incidental findings that are not necessarily relevant in the spaceflight context, such as increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, could also be unintentionally revealed.122 The ethical dilemma lies in the decision of whether to inform the participants, and indeed their family members, of these incidental findings, which may not be medically actionable. Ultimately, the protocol for handling incidental findings should be clearly defined when obtaining informed consent. Protocol could include giving participants the choice to opt in or out of receiving these results as well as developing appropriate support services when needed. A further ethical challenge surrounding the processing and usage of omics data is genetic discrimination, which is when an individual receives differential treatment based on their genetic information. In Europe, genetic discrimination is typically addressed in national laws, which are influenced by regional instruments, including the 2000 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the 1997 Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (also known as the Oviedo Convention).123 Chapter IV of the Oviedo Convention prohibits any form of discrimination based on genetic heritage and also prohibits the use of tests to predict genetic predisposition to diseases, unless these tests are carried out for medical or scientific purposes, together with the provision of adequate genetic counseling. Thus, this would seem to permit the use of omics to study individual susceptibility to spaceflight risks, such as radiation-induced cancers, as long as genetic counseling is provided. However, the potential role of omics-based susceptibility and predisposition in processes, such as flight assignment, nonetheless remains a contentious issue. In the United States, the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prevents NASA from making employment decisions, such as flight assignment, based on genetic data.121,122 From a European perspective, largely due to differences in national laws, the legality of using omics data in employment decisions, such as flight assignment, appears to be less clear. However, it seems likely that in flight assignment, the use of genomic susceptibility to disease, as opposed to manifestation, would be viewed as discriminatory. Additionally, ESA’s recent Parastronaut Feasibility Project could be seen to suggest a more inclusive approach to flight assignment; thus, the focus of omics technologies should probably be to reduce risk and improve health outcomes via personalized medicine approaches.25 However, some personalized medicine approaches are likely to be based on the processing of omics data deemed to be personal data under the GDPR. This could present a new challenge in operations with international partners. For example, if other space agencies such as NASA deploy personalized countermeasures but are unable to process data from ESA astronauts in compliance with the GDPR, either ESA astronauts will not be able to partake in the use of these countermeasures to improve occupational health or ESA will need to be able to deploy personalized countermeasure via an ESA program; personalized medicine approaches have recently been considered by an ESA Topical Team.25 Similarly, emergent challenges relating to GDPR compliance during processing of personal data from Europeans on commercial flights need to be considered in the context of initiatives, such as the database recently established by TRISH.22Storing and sharing data Because the ESA is an independent treaty organization based in Europe, sharing omics data within ESA’s network is of great importance. All 22 member states, associate members, and countries with cooperation agreements, including Canada, which sits on the Council, appear to follow the GDPR or are considered, via adequacy decisions, secure third countries due to similarities in data protection law. Thus, data can be transferred between these countries, as long as all parties first reach a consensus on issues, such as the basis for lawful processing and what constitutes personal data. While this sounds simple, reaching a consensus can be challenging because the GDPR allows scope for variation via national laws (e.g., Article 9), which may lead to key differences in interpretation and application of the GDPR.124,125 Furthermore, space biology research typically involves a great deal of international collaboration with other space agencies, posing a need for international sharing of data. For astronaut and/or SFP omics data deemed not to be personal data, international sharing could be relatively simple. For example, the data could potentially be uploaded to a publicly accessible biobank, such as the NASA GeneLab data repository.126 For context, NASA GeneLab has emerged as the primary database for spaceflight omics data, with significant European representation in GeneLab’s Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) and experimental datasets.127 However, if the data are deemed to be personal data, transfers to countries without adequacy decisions, including the United States, become challenging and unclear at present due to the recent “Schrems II” judgment.128 Due to challenges with ensuring GDPR compliance during global sharing of sensitive healthcare and research data, alternative models for data sharing have been considered. For example, in congruence with a declaration signed by 21 European countries to transnationally share data on at least one million human genomes by the end of 2022, large-scale initiatives, such as the European Genome-Phenome Archive, are shifting toward federated approaches.129 Federated approaches can invert the traditional data-sharing paradigm of bringing the data to the analysis by instead bringing the analysis to the data. Through federated approaches, researchers can analyze data across a distributed network of databases and then combine the results, potentially avoiding the transfer of personal data across jurisdictions.130,131 This model can also be applied to the training of AI models, in a process known as federated learning. For example, a successful model for predicting dyspnea, a common side effect after radiotherapy treatment of lung cancer, was trained on sensitive clinical data from several different hospitals across Europe, without the data ever having to leave the individual hospitals.132 Federated approaches could potentially serve as an appropriate solution for enabling international access and analysis of sensitive astronaut and/or SFP healthcare or research data, while ensuring international legal compliance. Other potential approaches to ease data sharing include data sanitization methods, to convert identifiable data into non-identifiable formats.133 However, methods that modify the data should be carefully balanced against the potential loss of scientific utility. With the specific security issues of data-sharing strategies in mind,130,134,135 data storage solutions, such as biobanks housing identifiable astronaut and/or SFP omics data, should meet high standards of security, to prevent issues such as data breaches. Chapter 4 of the GDPR requires that data controllers approach “data protection by design” and establish safeguards to protect the privacy and security of data in a manner that is proportionate to the risks involved.Conclusions Humanity has laid ambitious plans to venture to Mars and establish settlements on other planetary bodies, and commercial spaceflight is gaining rapid traction with the spacefaring population set to quickly increase both in terms of size and diversity. These new endeavors present new challenges for human health in space. Crucially, more data are needed, especially for environmental conditions beyond LEO, where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. Recently the first multiomic profiling studies of astronauts have been performed in the NASA Twins and SpaceX Inspiration4 missions. With their feasibility for spaceflight now demonstrated, these biological big data approaches are primed to transform our understanding of health in space, as they have for health on Earth. Importantly, in addition to elucidating mechanistic understanding of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning, these approaches also hold strong potential to improve risk quantification and occupational health in space, such as through the design and deployment of personalized medicine approaches. Thus, routinely applying these same approaches to European human subjects, including participants in analog environments and astronauts and/or SFPs in spaceflight missions, is a golden opportunity. In order to achieve the full potential of these big data approaches, several challenges need to be addressed in a cohesive European fashion. First, how do we best store and ensure collected data are AI ready? Second, which datasets should we collect and when? Third, how do we enable open science approaches while protecting personal data? Although we have introduced the challenges and proposed some options, it is important to achieve European consensus on these questions (Table 1). We propose forming an ESA topical team and/or holding an ESA workshop as a strategic way forward. The goal is to bring together European human omics/data science researchers and human subject researchers to address these questions in coordination with ESA and stakeholders from the commercial spaceflight sector. Importantly, this consensus will need to consider the international context of human research on the ISS, the commercial aspects of data science, and the personal nature of the data. These latter aspects could be achieved via collaboration with organizations, such as International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP), HRMRB, and TRISH. Table 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spatial omics technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular organizations and interactions within a tissue of interest. These assays can identify specific compartments or regions in a tissue with differential transcript or protein abundance, delineate their interactions, and complement other methods in defining cellular phenotypes. A variety of spatial methodologies are being developed and commercialized; however, these techniques differ in spatial resolution, multiplexing capability, scale/throughput, and coverage. Here, we review the current and prospective landscape of single cell to subcellular resolution spatial omics technologies and analysis tools to provide a comprehensive picture for both research and clinical applications. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-022-02824-6.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion As spatial omics technologies mature and provide a deeper understanding of the cellular states and functions, spatial epigenomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics will also reveal a great number of biological insights that complement the transcript-level findings. Integration strategies across different molecular classes (for example, integrating metabolomics data with proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic data) would also be needed. Development of appropriate analysis packages that offers end-to-end solutions for each technology, as well as compatibility with orthogonal platforms is also crucial to increase the usage and application of these technologies. In summary, the spatial omics field has blossomed and radically increased the breadth and resolution of in situ experiments in the past few years. These technologies can now boast detection of more than 10,000 unique gene targets with 50–100 nm spatial resolution. Developments in probe chemistry, image acquisition, and commercialization are driving down costs, transforming spatial omics technologies into a commonplace technique available to all labs, similar to NGS in the 2010s and microarrays in the early 2000s.

Copyright notice ID: 9746133 PMID: 36514162 Abstract Spatial omics technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular organizations and interactions within a tissue of interest. These assays can identify specific compartments or regions in a tissue with differential transcript or protein abundance, delineate their interactions, and complement other methods in defining cellular phenotypes. A variety of spatial methodologies are being developed and commercialized; however, these techniques differ in spatial resolution, multiplexing capability, scale/throughput, and coverage. Here, we review the current and prospective landscape of single cell to subcellular resolution spatial omics technologies and analysis tools to provide a comprehensive picture for both research and clinical applications. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-022-02824-6.Spatial omics technologies Methods for molecular profiling of single cells in situ, within their native spatial context, are rapidly developing. In recent years, traditional experimental methods, including barcoding with reporters [1], immunohistochemistry (IHC) [2, 3], and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [4, 5], have given ways to spatial omics technologies to cover a larger number of transcripts or areas (Fig. 1). Broadly, spatial omics technologies vary in their spatial resolution (minimum size of molecular units profiled), coverage (breadth of tissue covered), scale and throughput (number of samples and profiling speed), and multiplexing capacity (breadth of molecular entities profiled simultaneously). Depending on the research question, the profiling methods can be divided into (1) targeted or multiplexed probe- or antibody-based and (2) transcriptome-wide or next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches [6]. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Typical workflow of spatial omics experiment. Most technologies offer compatibility with flash frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. If in situ capture-imaging methods are chosen, a customized set of antibodies or probes will be hybridized to acquire or reconstruct images of multiple channels. With sequencing-based methods, barcoded regions within the slide will be captured for library preparation and sequencing. The downstream analyses are similar across technologies; once the signals are normalized, quantified, and pooled for each cell defined by the cell segmentation masks. Standard analyses such as differential expression, cell proportion, and gene set enrichment can be performed. Using spatial information in particular, cell–cell interaction and ligand-receptor analyses can be performed in-depth. Such information can also be used to define neighborhood or domains of tissue microenvironment, depending on the research question. Figure created with BioRenderMost spatial omics technologies with subcellular level resolution are performed on slide (in situ) using either microscopy or NGS platforms. Currently, there are over 50 different spatial mapping technologies available. In this review, we focus on the latest technologies that enable investigation of cells at the cellular and subcellular level (less than 10 μm, Fig. 2A). The history and technical workflow of lower resolution, non-single-cell, spatial omics technologies have been covered previously [7]. However, at < 10 μm resolution, the cell body and nucleus can be detected for single cell level quantification; with technologies that allow < 1 μm resolution, researchers can then detect a few other large organelles including cytoplasm-membrane distinction; at 200–300 nm, more well-resolved characterizations are possible including mitochondria-, ER-, or Golgi- specific transcript or protein quantifications. At 50 nm ranges, entirely new cellular phenotypes (e.g., movement of organelles and protein trafficking) can be measured. Table 1 highlights available technologies that allow subcellular capture of molecular entities in cells, as well as their technical specifications. Fig. 2.

Antibodies and RNA probes, such as endogenous transcripts or proteins, are the most ubiquitous detection methods (Fig. 1). Traditional immunofluorescence (IF) imaging methods can only capture four to five channels at a time, limited by spectral overlap. Using probes or antibodies that contain cleavable linkers for sequential imaging and/or barcoding scheme to distinguish multiple probes imaged simultaneously or within the same wavelength, now researchers can profile more than 50 cellular entities from a single slide. The technologies using antibody panels with sequential rounds of staining, imaging, and bleaching/stripping include: Cyclic ImmunoFluorescence (CyCIF) [8], iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) [9], multi-epitope-ligand-cartography (MELC) [10], iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) [11], ChipCytometry [12], Cell DIVE (multiplexed immunofluorescence, MxIF) [8], and MACSima Imaging Cyclic Staining (MICS) [13]. These are generally limited to 30–50 targets due to constraints in tissue integrity, spectral overlap, and spillover (Table 1). To further increase the number of antibodies, technologies such as CO-Detection by indiEXing (CODEX) [14] increase the target breath to 100 by staining a cocktail of DNA-barcoded antibodies. It then uses complementary oligonucleotide probes and comparatively gentle iterative hybridization cycles for detection. Alternative to imaging-based readouts are methods which use mass spectrometry, such as imaging mass cytometry (IMC) [15] and multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) [16]. For IMC and MIBI, antibodies are tagged with rare metals, and tissue samples are stained with the whole antibody cocktail. The tissue sample is then ablated with an ionizing laser in a raster fashion, and detection of the rare metals is possible through time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which has much less spectral overlap than optical methods. To avoid nonspecific binding, epitope loss, and tissue degradation, antibody-methods may require further optimization, such as permeabilization or antibody incubation protocols. Using pre-optimized, commercially available antibody panels can significantly reduce this process, although this option is not available for all tissue types. Virtually, all antibody methods capture regions of interest (ROIs) within the tissue slide due to constraints of acquisition time (optical methods) or cost (mass spectrometry-based methods), while providing data that is only relatively quantitative (quantified by relative spectral intensity). A detailed description of these technologies is covered in related manuscripts and reviews specifically focusing on multiplexed methods [17–19]. Similar to antibodies, mRNA probes (specific for sequences of targeted transcripts) can be used to design a panel for targeted spatial profiling. Such approaches have shorter protocols, easier handling, and enable more transcripts (generally few hundreds of transcripts, up to 10,000) to be captured than antibody-based methods [20]. Different multiplexed RNA FISH methods use slightly different approaches to probe design, imaging, and stripping [21]. Specifically, high multiplexing is achieved by using spectral barcoding (specific combination of fluorophores each targeting segments of an RNA resolved by microscopy) [22] and temporal barcoding (multiple rounds of probe hybridization and stripping to create predefined color sequence) [23]. Recently, the combination of two barcoding methods and more complicated barcoding strategies can increase the number of molecular entities that can be profiled. For example, while seqFISH uses spectral barcoding of genes across four or five fluorophores for each given temporal barcode, seqFISH + adds mRNA-specific sequences to assign a pseudocolor for each spectral barcode (fluorophore). The new seqFISH + technology can now capture 60 pseudocolors instead of 5 per cycle, allowing more than 8000 gene profiles [24]. Barcoding approaches can generally capture more transcripts than antibody-based methods, but are more sensitive to losses (false-negative signals due to dropout) and tissue degradation between the cycles (Fig. 2B, C) [21]. To overcome potential errors and dropouts, most probe-based methods utilize extra hybridization steps added for every few cycles to ensure the rest of the transcripts are detected properly. Current technologies include multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) [25], molecular cartography [26], sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH +) [24], sequent ouroboros single-molecule FISH (osmFISH) [27], Split-FISH [28], hybridization-based in situ sequencing (HybISS) [29], Esper [30, 31], CosMx [32], Multi Omic Single-scan Assay with Integrated Combinatorial Analysis (MOSAICA) [33], and combinatorial padlock-probe-amplified FISH (coppaFISH) [34]. Each technology utilizes slightly different probe length, design methods, and protocols. For example, MERFISH probes hybridize with disulfide bond while seqFISH uses DNAse I treatment to cleave the probes for the following rounds of detection. Although most technologies would give similar results in most cases, factors such as probe length, tissue autofluorescence, tissue degradation, and protocol compatibility need to be considered for optimal results. For example, tissues can have different stability for signals over multiple rounds (or long duration) of enzymatic treatments or temperature variations. Indeed, prior work has shown a range of concordance between various spatial imaging technologies, such as with the GeoMx and Hyperion systems, which showed high correlation for differences in cell types and expression of healthy vs. pneumonia (r = 0.699) and different stages of COVID-19 (r = 0.630) but lower correlation of expression metrics of COVID-19 vs. healthy patient (r = 0.362) [35]. In general, the probe-based methods are more quantitative than antibody-based methods, as absolute numbers of transcripts are counted as individual dots within each scanned spot. Some probe-based methods can also utilize oligo-conjugated antibodies to incorporate subcellular protein landmarks (i.e., organelles) as well. However, the probe design and library composition are critical and sometimes limiting; some techniques are limited by gene length (transcripts must be > 750 bp), expression levels (highly expressing transcripts can create optical crowding and zero inflation spots called), and isoforms (splicing frequencies may be a source of error but can also target differentially transcribed exons or introns) [36]. Some of these limitations are an active field of research and can be overcome in several ways if properly accounted for, such as decreasing the binding range (e.g., 25 nucleotides) or overlapping probes to map isoforms. Despite these limitations, there are more published data and analytical software tools already optimized for these targeted technologies (vs. transcriptome-wide methods, described below).Transcriptome-wide spatial omics with NGS platforms In addition to scRNA-seq methods that allow a comprehensive view on the transcriptome of a cell, several methods for spatial profiling of the transcriptome in an unbiased manner have been developed. Earlier methods focused on targeted acquisition of sample subsets for sequencing and used laser-capture microscopy (LCM) and photocleavable marker-based methods, where specific regions marked by surface markers or mRNA probes were collected and sequenced. LCM-seq [37], geographical position sequencing (Geo-seq) [38], NICHE-seq [39], and NanoString GeoMx DSP [40] are a few additional contemporary examples of this technology. These technologies allow user-directed profiling of specific ROIs with as few as 10 cells, allowing researchers to characterize multiple replicates or tissue types/locations for each sample. Methods that allow single cell or subcellular resolution rely on spatial barcoding and in situ sequencing. Technologies such as fluorescent in situ sequencing (FISSEQ) [41], spatially resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping (STARmap) [42], Slide-SeqV2 [43], deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) [44], expansion sequencing (ExSeq) [45], high-definition spatial transcriptomics (HDST) [46], Seq-scope [47], polony (or DNA cluster)-indexed library-sequencing (PIXEL-seq) [48], and SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-Sequencing (Stereo-Seq) [49] (and ST, 10X Visium for multi-cell version of the same technology) use grid-like nanoballs or sequencing sites on the slide. The resolutions and chemistry of the sequencing sites vary by technologies, as well as amplification methods. For example, FISSEQ uses rolling cycle amplification (RCA) where a random hexamer reverse transcription (RT) primer gets hybridized for cDNA transcription and amplification; STARmap uses padlock probes to avoid RT and use of RNA template; technologies like HDST, Slide-SeqV2, and DBiT-seq all use Barcode and UMI structures with varying nucleotide lengths optimized for each technique and preferred sequencing platform. The individual spots on these slides are several times smaller than typical mammalian cells, enabling single to subcellular characterization of sequencing reads. Although it may be more costly, in situ sequencing approaches allow whole-slide detection whereas capture-based sequencing methods are more focused on smaller ROIs within the tissue. Because the resolution can be limited by the size of the amplicon hybridized on the slide for sequencing, different strategies to improve the UMI and quality of the reads are currently being explored in these technologies. Also, methodologies to capture total transcriptome (viral, coding, and noncoding RNAs) are also developed, such as spatial total RNA-sequencing (STRS) [50]. In addition, there are spatial barcoding methods such as CITE-seq [51], ZipSeq [52], ExSeq [45], XYZeq [53], or sci-space [54], where additional cellular information such as antibody staining or barcoding is added before pooling for single cell sequencing workflow. Additional single cell features such as cell types or tissue location or compartmentalization can be deduced; however, a precise picture of cellular organization is not yet possible. Inspired by these technologies and to overcome the limitations, multiplexed detection methods of transcriptome and proteome have been developed. Examples include spatial multi-omics (SM-Omics) [55], Spatial PrOtein and Transcriptome Sequencing (SPOTS) [56], and spatial co-indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes for multi-omics mapping by NGS (spatial-CITE-seq) [57]. These technologies combine existing NGS-based methodologies to allow computational reconstruction of spatial full transcriptome and 200 + proteome maps. Although these technologies make use of NGS technologies to cover the full transcriptome while recording large panels of proteins in tissues, the full transcriptome characterizations are still limited by resolution (SM-Omics uses 10X Visium which allows 55 μm resolution), or location detection (SPOTS and spatial-CITE-seq uses CITE-seq, which is an antibody-binding based method, to provide cellular context, not precise locations within the tissue).Other spatial omics technologies for multi-modal study Similar to the spatial omics technologies introduced above, which mainly focus on gene expression profiles (and surface marker proteins), approaches around spatial genomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and epigenomics are also emerging. Spatial ATAC sequencing can be performed by in situ Tn5 transposition, and probe ligation using microfluidics devices, followed by standard digestion and sequencing for chromatin accessibility profiling [58, 59]. Resolution is limited by the microfluidic channel width (20 μm); however, single cell resolution is less crucial than transcript quantification as the analysis relies on the signals within the nuclear regions. Similarly, specific chromatin modifications can be quantified using Spatial-CUT&Tag that applies CUT&Tag chemistry with microfluidic devices [60]. Both technologies use deterministic barcoding delivered over the tissue surface through a microfluidic device attached to the slide. The barcodes are delivered twice perpendicularly so that the combinations result in 2D arrayed pixels containing spatial information. Spatial metabolomics techniques such as targeted approaches using antibodies (metaFISH) or untargeted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) hold promise for mapping the spatial context of metabolic species and molecular interactions within the native tissue context, but still suffer from trade-offs in spatial resolution or the breadth of molecular entities profiled [61]. Such added layers of genomic data allow researchers to ask new biological questions. For example, in addition to expression level changes within tissue microenvironment, clonal expansion of specific mutations and spatial co-occurrences can be investigated using spatial genomics such as slide-DNA-seq [62]. This method is a modified version of slide-seq where DNA sequences are captured with small (3 mm) beads that are spatially indexed, instead of RNA transcripts. Optimized methodologies for histone removal and Tn5 treatments for a variety of tumor tissue types have been shown to prevent potential bias in DNA capture. More recently, spatial host-microbiome sequencing (SHM-seq) has been reported [63]. SHM-seq is an adapted version from Spatial Transcriptomics, where mRNA probes for transcript captures are modified to DNA capture probes so that they can obtain both polyadenylated transcripts and 16S rRNA hypervariable regions. The recent progress on spatial characterizations allows researchers to locate interactions at the genomics, cellular, and organismal level [64].Overall workflow and experimental design criteria Sample preparation and experimental design Overall experimental and analytical workflows span a few consistent features (Fig. 1). Generally, mouse or human tissue slides are used for experiments, since the relevant probe and target libraries are already commercially available and represent the largest market; however, in principle these methods can work on any species with an annotated genome (Fig. 3). It is also possible to use cell cultures or sections from specific culture platforms. Most of the techniques offer compatibility with flash frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) formats. FF format often yields better RNA quality and simpler extraction processing; however, FFPE format more faithfully conserves tissue architecture and is easier to store and ship. Success also varies depending on the sample quality (RNA integrity and processing protocols) and technology (probe/antibody design, permeabilization and chemistry for hybridization, imaging, and library preparation). Some technologies generate stacked multiplexed images to capture all the transcripts across 5–10 μm thick sections and to differentiate transcripts expressed in nuclear and cytoplasmic regions [26]. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Example subcellular spatial omics data and analysis. A Subcellular spatial omics analysis starts with calling transcripts (or other molecular entities of interest) at their 3D locations from z-stacked images. B Using boundaries drawn by cell segmentation algorithms, the counts are aggregated into single-cell expression profiles, from which cell labels and neighborhood traits are inferred. C Both information can then be used for analyses commonly used for single cell and bulk image and sequencing methods, such as differential expression, clustering, cellular interaction analyses. The tissue sample images in all panels were provided by NanoString Technologies (CosMx platform) [65]A key question to consider in choosing the methodology and the experimental design is whether specific transcripts, pathways, or cell types need prioritizing. If specific loci are already known, then choosing an in situ capture based methodology and obtaining absolute quantification of the transcripts is often the better approach. Alternatively, if the research hypothesis is more discovery-based, especially for unknown cellular subpopulations, or if a project is aiming for a global comparison across conditions or samples, NGS-based methods may be more appropriate.Available reference databases for integration and validation Even though the field is relatively new, there are some reference data sources available to explore different methodologies and to use as healthy references (Table 2). For example, the GeoMx spatial organ atlas offers human tissue spatial data from five organ systems: kidney, brain, intestine, lymph node, and pancreas (https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/spatial-organ-atlas/). Vizgen also released a mouse liver spatial atlas for people to explore and understand the extent of the technologies, and Akoya biosciences has shared its data from a range of tissues online, including brain, placenta, breast, lung, head and neck, and tonsil online (https://www.akoyabio.com/fusion/data-gallery/). Since many of these investigations focus on cancer samples and normal controls, some datasets can be accessed through human tumor atlas (https://data.humantumoratlas.org/) or the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP, https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/).

Currently, systematization of data standards is lacking, except for the convergence of imaging data into the metadata-rich OME-TIFF file format. Public sharing of datasets and in-depth, online guides will further aid the community by ensuring standardization and reproducibility of data [69]. Alternatively, single cell and single nuclei RNA sequencing can be used to cross validate and overcome limitations of spatial omics technologies (i.e., limited detection of rare transcripts, interpolation of missing transcripts through cell type label transfer). Commonly used reference databases are summarized in Table 2. When choosing the reference, it is crucial to understand tissue type and technology of interest. Sample types, tissue dissociation methods, cellular heterogeneity, and type of sequencing chemistry can carry considerable impact, particularly when interested in rare cell types or transient cell expression states (e.g., fetal hemoglobin). For more rigorous data integration and validation, common coordinate framework (CCF) based mapping has been discussed and developed [70, 71].Computational methodologies to analyze spatial omics data The information captured from spatial omics data at subcellular resolution is predominantly converted into single cell format (quantification of counts/cell) or csv files, which are then suitable for downstream analysis. In the following section, we introduce methodologies and published software packages for general spatial analysis and available multiplexed image viewers for visualization of the highly multiplexed images. We also review key methods involving traditional analysis similar to scRNA-seq analyses, newer methods that make use of spatial information, and auxiliary methods applied directly to the raw image level. Available general-purpose software and pipelines As most recent spatial omics technologies support more markers than traditional image formats support, visualizing results of spatial omics data is a non-trivial task. Several specialized image software such as ImageJ or napari can be used to visualize subsets of markers. As some spatial platforms gather information on a per spot basis, several denoising software tools such as content-aware image restoration (CARE) [72], residual channel attention networks (RCAN) [73], and Noise2Void [74] can be applied to raw images to improve the quality especially in fluorescence based platforms. For mass cytometry based spatial platforms, data quality can be improved by spillover correction software [75]. For example, if the ground truth of spillover is known or empirically adjusted from the data, Reinforcement Dynamic Spillover EliminAtion (REDSEA) [76] leverages the spatial proximity of cells with signal that comes from generally mutually exclusive markers. There are also user-friendly end-to-end software packages for spatial omics. Graphical user interface supporting software pipelines like ImageJ [77], QuPath [78], CellProfiler [79] and many other command line tools take raw input data and transform them into single cell format with coordinate information. Other software like squidpy [80] and scimap (https://github.com/labsyspharm/scimap) provide user-friendly Python APIs for spatial analysis, visualization, and a collection of preprocessed datasets from multiple diverse spatial platforms in AnnData format. Depending on the platform, some technologies offer end-to-end packages for sample processing to data visualization and analysis. For example, TITAN [81] offers open-source software options for IMC image visualization, cell segmentation, analysis, and export. Other commercial technologies also offer end-to-end solutions optimized for each technology, such as AtoMx for GeoMx and CosMx (NanoString), PhenoCycler Software Analysis Suite for CODEX and PhenoCycler (Akoya), and MERSCOPE Visualizer for MERFISH platform (Vizgen).Traditional spatial omics methods for single cell analysis Typically, the outputs of most spatial omics analyses involve images or barcodes with spatial coordinate information. Such spatial information can be treated as an additional layer of metadata and help inform downstream analysis. Successful downstream analyses on spatial omics data, which either are high dimensional images or spatial barcodes with coordinates, heavily rely upon accurate cell segmentation, which is a process to infer cell boundaries based on intensity values from captured coordinates. Cell segmentation is done on generalizable cellular features, such as DNA staining for nuclei and membrane staining or (cell-type specific) cytoplasmic markers for cell boundaries. Some of imaging-based methods use serialized, z-stack images to better distinguish cellular features each round of imaging; however, this is not so common in sequencing-based methodologies because imaging for segmentation is typically done right before the library preparation or on consecutive tissue slices. There are two broad categories of cell segmentation algorithms both based on supervised learning: (1) a combination of computer vision-based feature extraction and machine learning models like random forests and (2) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning models. The first group, including Ilastik [82], extracts intensity, edge, and texture features from images using Gaussian filters and their derivatives. Then, the user labels pixels in images typically representing nuclei, cytoplasm, and background areas, which are used as labels for pixel classification using random forests based on the extracted features. The software can then either produce probability maps for the specified classes which can be segmented with CellProfiler [79] or a segmentation map directly. The other group uses deep learning for segmentation. DeepCell [83], Stardist [84], Splinedist [85], Cellpose [86], and Omnipose [87] are all convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models capable of feature extraction, probability map prediction, and cell segmentation. Deepcell incorporates multiple segmentation subtasks including cell segmentation, nuclei segmentation, and cell tracking for sequence of moving cell images via deep watershed methods. DeepCell also offers Panoptic net-based models that use a combination of semantic and instance segmentation. Related tools like Stardist and Splinedist focus on nuclear segmentation using the geometric properties of nuclei; Stardist models nuclear morphology as star convex polygons and assigns probabilities based on center-to-border distances to detect and separate objects, and splinedist generalizes a similar model to capture more smooth-shaped cell masks and recognize eccentric cells using spline interpolation. Cellpose is a general-purpose model for both nuclear and whole-cell segmentation, while the more recent Omnipose specializes in segmentation of bacterial cells that often are elongated or eccentric. Regardless of the segmentation method, the various analytical approaches converge on the creation of a single-cell matrix analogous to scRNA-seq data, by aggregating RNA/protein signal intensity values by sum or mean based on the segmentation masks. The aggregated single-cell matrix can then be transformed and normalized through a combination of scaling functions such as logarithm (base2 or base10), minmax, or z-score, and they can be batch corrected using algorithms such as Combat [88], MNN Correct [89], batch-balanced k-nearest neighbors [90], and harmony [91]. One can apply conventional scRNA-seq analysis such as dimensionality reduction using PCA [92], T-SNE [93], or UMAP [94] and clustering with Leiden [95] or Phenotyping by Accelerated Refined Community-partitioning (PARC) [96] algorithms. The neighborhood of the cells can also be defined from the intensity features, using modern graph based cell clustering methods such as Louvain [97], Leiden, or PARC clustering. From the expression profiles, phenotyping is possible by manually assigning cell labels based on the expression of markers. While this procedure may be laborious, it enables the detection of novel cell types and states. Nonetheless, methods for automated prediction of cell type identities such as Astir and Stellar also exist [98, 99]. Single-cells and their phenotypes can be visualized either by projecting feature intensity as colors on scatter plots of reduced dimensionality projections, or by visualizing features on heatmaps at the single-cell or cell type level. Common downstream analysis often involves the comparison of cell type abundance between samples of contrasting biological groups and detection of differential expression of markers within cell types between sample groups. Several of these methods were reviewed previously [100]. For quantitative technologies, expression levels can be also compared using standard differential gene expression analysis for bulk and single cell RNA-seq. In addition to differentially expressed genes, spatially variable genes can be obtained by published packages such as Trendsceek [101], SpatialDE [102], Spatial PAttern Recognition via Kernels (SPARK) [103], and SpaGCN [104]. These packages use different algorithms to compute spatial variations and are implemented for specific technologies. For example, SpatialDE uses Gaussian process regression in which it can detect genes across regions or multiple conditions but is computationally intensive and cannot identify domains. SpaGCN uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) and provides both gene and domain level spatial analyses, but tissue structures identified by cell types are not included in the analysis unlike the methodologies covered in the next section. Also of note, the methods for normalization, batch correction, and data cleaning are just as paramount in spatial expression mapping as they are in bulk analysis, and a range of methods (e.g., COMBAT, EDAseq, RUV2, SEER, etc.) can be used [105].Novel spatial omics methods using spatial information Highly resolved spatial omics data allows discovery of new cell types, cell interactions, and tissue structures compared to traditional, single cell sequencing methods because the data comes with paired spatial information in the native tissue conformation. Currently, most methods in this area construct cell graphs, with cells as nodes and edges based on threshold spatial distance between cells to leverage spatial information. The two large branches in this field are (1) spatial microenvironment analysis, which groups and analyzes cells based on their spatial context and (2) inference of intercellular interactions, which investigates how frequently a pair of cell types interact in native tissue conformation. One major lineage of computational spatial omics uses cell context to perform various downstream tasks. Stellar (https://github.com/snap-stanford/stellar) is a cell type annotation tool using both marker expression profiles and spatial context information. By learning cellular phenotypes not only from the intensity of markers but also from the spatial arrangement of cell types, Stellar enables the prediction of cell types in an unlabeled dataset and discovery of cell types specific to a new tissue. SpatialLDA [106] is a tumor microenvironment detection method that identifies associated topic or context of each cell based on cell type distribution of immediate spatial neighbors, which for tumor cells could be thought of as tumor microenvironments. UTAG [107] is a structural microanatomy annotation and analysis method that categorizes cells into anatomical structures across organs and diseases including cancers. Both SpatialLDA and UTAG infer larger-scale patterns or organization in tissue, which can be further interrogated to understand how cellular composition and interaction give rise to tissue structure capable of contributing to organ-specific physiology, overall organ architecture, or micro-environments in the tumor micro-environment which may condition clinically relevant outcomes. Another branch of interest specifically focuses on learning intercellular interaction. Boisset et al. introduced a computational foundation to quantify cell-to-cell communication by graph permutation test [108]. They proposed assessment of intercellular communication frequency by randomly mixing cell type identities and assigning a statistical likelihood to empirically observed interaction between cell types. A similar approach, using permutation analysis, has been used to detect increased interaction between macrophages and fibroblasts in alveolar walls, which potentially explains fibrosis and the thickening of the alveolar wall in COVID-19 patients [35, 67, 68]. The increased macrophage interactions with fibroblast and other immune cells were consistently observed when cellular interaction clusters were defined by co-occurrence of the cell type proportion changes (https://github.com/jpark-lab/SpatialAnalysis). Other methods try to explain cellular communication through machine learning methods. For example, node-centric expression modeling (NCEM) [109] models cell-to-cell communication events by gradient analysis of variational graph autoencoders. The idea here is to investigate which change in cell-to-cell communication results in a change in observed gene expression through a non-linear graph neural network. Multiview Intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy) [110] is a graph-based method that investigates marker (gene) networks at multiple spatial resolutions to investigate intra- and inter- cellular interaction at multiple lengths. With the ability to capture molecules at a subcellular resolution, co-localization and compartmentalization of molecular entities can be analyzed at a deeper level. For example, RNA species in different subcellular compartments (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear vs. cytoplasmic) and their spatial patterning within the cell can be extracted as an independent feature from expression level [20]. Transcripts that are dependent on cellular states such as infection, cell cycles, circadian rhythm can be profiled more accurately and provide new insights. In addition, distribution of cellular features (i.e., protein or viral RNA transcript patterns within a cell) can be studied for biological significance. These features are limited by our understanding of cellular processes and by methodologies to analyze such changes and generate hypotheses in an unbiased manner.Multi-modal analysis and ML-aided spatial data analysis methods Integration of spatial omics data with other data modalities, such as single-cell RNA or assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing, can enable an even more comprehensive view of cellular systems, by complementing the spatial assays in terms of the number of molecular entities under study and cells profiled. A popular approach to integrate different datasets consists of identifying a subset of variable or “notable” features to serve as anchors across two data modalities. Several methodologies were developed around the integration between different single cell or single nuclei sequencing modalities such as RNA and ATAC. Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) introduces a statistical framework for the integration of data modalities, specifically within a common sample space derived from the same sets of cells [111]. One of the most used software packages for scRNA-seq analysis, Seurat, also has developed methodologies to integrate such modalities as well as antibody-derived tags from cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and spatial omics technologies such as Visium, by using weighted nearest neighbors (WNN) analysis. Multimodal omics analysis framework (MUON), which introduces the MuData format compatible across Python, R, and Julia programming languages, provides a shared interface for commonly used methodologies such as MOFA, WNN, and similarity network fusion (SNF) [112]. Similar framework packages include MultiMAP [113], linked inference of genomic experimental relationships (LIGER) [114], inteGrative anaLysis of mUlti-omics at single-cEll Resolution (GLUER) [115], clustering on network of samples (Conos) [116], and integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF) [117], but some of the packages are more focused on specific spatial omics technologies or analysis of single-cell sequencing modalities. Recently, more packages and methodologies, such as Cell2location [118], CellTrek [119], multi-modal structured embedding (MUSE) [120], and Tangram [121], are being developed specifically to map single cell information to spatial omics analyses. For example, Tangram aligns expression profiles from sc/snRNA-seq to spatial datasets from the same region including MERFISH, STARmap, general smFISH, Visium, and histological images [121]. Such methods to map other data modalities are also used within spatial omics dataset when gene imputation, an approach used to fill in the missing datapoints due to low detection level, limited number of targets, potential errors or dropouts, or genetic variation are needed [122]. On the contrary, multi-omics image integration and tissue state mapping (MIAAIM) focuses on integration of different spatial omics modalities that have diverse densities and spatial resolutions [123]. As most of these software packages only offer methodologies for proper integration of multiple data modalities without losing single cell resolution, more work is needed for multimodal data exploration and visualization.Conclusion As spatial omics technologies mature and provide a deeper understanding of the cellular states and functions, spatial epigenomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics will also reveal a great number of biological insights that complement the transcript-level findings. Integration strategies across different molecular classes (for example, integrating metabolomics data with proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic data) would also be needed. Development of appropriate analysis packages that offers end-to-end solutions for each technology, as well as compatibility with orthogonal platforms is also crucial to increase the usage and application of these technologies. In summary, the spatial omics field has blossomed and radically increased the breadth and resolution of in situ experiments in the past few years. These technologies can now boast detection of more than 10,000 unique gene targets with 50–100 nm spatial resolution. Developments in probe chemistry, image acquisition, and commercialization are driving down costs, transforming spatial omics technologies into a commonplace technique available to all labs, similar to NGS in the 2010s and microarrays in the early 2000s. This unparalleled depth and richness of data leading to spatially intact single cell profiles promises to fuel new discoveries for infectious disease, tumor oncology, and basic science applications like cell signaling, migration, and spatiotemporal-delineated functions. Efforts to introduce three-dimensional, deep-slide scanning, and time series data collection will also continue to propel the field even further in the coming years, revealing novel cellular architectures and entirely new domains of biology.

    "abstract": "Abstract During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

Copyright notice ID: 10422843 PMID: 37568226 Abstract During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

Yeasts and yeast-like fungi isolated from Antarctic environments (proposed as resembling the surface and conditions of Mars and/or Icy Moons) were reported to successfully resist a wide spectrum of stressors which mimic conditions on other planetary bodies, including ionizing radiation, UV-flux irradiation, extremely low and high temperatures, desiccation, high salinity and acidic conditions (Onofri et al. 2004, 2020; Selbmann et al. 2005; Pacelli et al. 2017, 2021; Buzzini et al. 2018). Since National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Planetary Protection (PP) seeks to prevent anthropogenic microbial transport (forward contamination) to other planets (Cockell 2005; Conley and Rummel 2010), evaluation of hitchhiking extremophilic yeasts on spacecraft and associated components is necessary. A wide range of microbial taxa, including both bacterial and fungal species, have been detected in various NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (La Duc et al. 2012), but historically NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) PP policy has focused on monitoring and eradicating bacteria, specifically those producing endospores. However, the presence of fungi in these cleanrooms has also recently been assessed, since fungi are tolerant of a wide range of extreme conditions (Parker et al. 2022; Blachowicz et al. 2022; Chander et al. 2022b). Characterization of fungi (including yeast) is important both for assessing the risk of forward contamination and updating appropriate cleaning and sterilization strategies (Benardini and Moissl-Eichinger 2022). Therefore, newly discovered fungal (including yeasts) species in cleanrooms must be evaluated not only for their morphology, but also at the genomic level so that new countermeasures can be developed to eradicate them based on their biology and resilient properties (Chander et al. 2022b). To date, only filamentous fungi have been described from cleanrooms (Parker et al. 2022; Blachowicz et al. 2022; Chander et al. 2022b). In contrast to filamentous fungi, yeasts are microscopic and predominantly unicellular (Boekhout et al. 2021). It has been shown that yeast and yeast-like fungi are capable of adapting to and colonizing various ecological niches due to their genetic and phenotypic plasticity and robustness (Ene et al. 2015; Ribeiro et al. 2022). Several important adaptations facilitate survival of yeast cells in harsh environments, including production of thick external polysaccharide capsules, forming biofilm, and UV protective compounds, melanin, carotenoids and mycosporines (Buzzini et al. 2018). In this study, we describe for the first time two novel yeast species from NASA cleanrooms, which are oligotrophic extreme environments. To explore yeast diversity in various environments including NASA cleanrooms, understanding their phylogenetic diversity and ecology is necessary. Phylogenies based on 16S ribosomal RNA or average nucleotide identity (ANI) are most commonly used for prokaryote taxonomy, but fungal species are identified with nucleotide sequences of multiple conserved gene regions (Lücking et al. 2021). To identify yeasts, both phenotypic traits and molecular analyses are required (Boekhout et al. 2021). The modern yeast taxonomy includes genealogical approaches based on single locus (ITS or LSU), multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Libkind et al. 2020; Boekhout et al. 2021; Chander et al. 2022b). Molecular phylogeny for species recognition in Fungi is gaining broad attention (Lücking et al. 2021), but understanding species ecology requires investigating morphology, physiology, and biochemistry leading to the Consolidated Species Concept based on the so-called polyphasic approach (Boekhout et al. 2021). One of the objectives of this study was to characterize two novel yeast species by employing the polyphasic taxonomic approach, which is necessary to formally describe the two novel taxa. Colony morphology, microscopic features, and physiological properties were combined with MLSA phylogeny (seven loci). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis based on available WGS was applied to test its utility for species discrimination. The assembled and characterized genomes of Naganishia kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T and Cystobasidium onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T were compared with genomes of other closely related species to identify unique and shared evolutionary characters. Considering unique properties of the habitat challenging the microbial life, the third objective of this study was to assess the UV-C resistance of the two novel yeast species and compared with a UV-C resistant extremophilic yeast, Naganishia onofrii strain DBVPG 5303 from Miage glacier (Mont Blanc, Alps, Italy) at the altitude of 3892 m above sea level (Turchetti et al. 2015).MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample collection and isolation of yeasts Steps for sample collection and isolation of yeasts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF) and the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) cleanrooms were previously described (Parker et al. 2022; Blachowicz et al. 2022). Briefly, samples were collected from cleanroom surfaces using moist polyester wipes and were agitated in 200 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and shaken for 1 min. The resulting PBS suspension was concentrated using an Innova Prep LLC concentrating pipette and spread onto plates containing potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, #213,400) mixed with chloramphenicol (25 µg/mL). Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7–14 days, and yeast strains were isolated, purified, and stored for further characterization. Steps for determination of microscopic traits and observation and microscopic morphology were followed as per previous protocol (Chander et al. 2022b). In a nutshell, a small block of agar was placed in the center of a sterile slide, and all four sides of the agar were inoculated with the yeast suspension. Subsequently, a sterile cover slip was gently placed on top of the agar block. The slide culture was kept in a moist Petri dish lined with filter paper soaked in sterile water. After 14–21 days, the yeast grew out onto the coverslip and the slide was tested. The cover slip was gently removed with sterile forceps and placed on a clean microscopic slide with a drop of water or lactophenol cotton blue (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) for microscopic observations. Phase contrast images were captured on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera and Olympus cellSens software. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were generated on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with Nikon NIS Elements software. Cell morphological characters were measured with the Olympus cellSens or Nikon NIS Elements software. Assimilation tests were performed in liquid media following the procedures described by (Kurtzman et al. 2011), in custom-made microplates (Nunc 96-Well U-Bottom plate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL tubes (Falcon, Corning) using the same standard set of substrates and with YT MicroPlates (BioLog) as described elsewhere (Greetham et al. 2014; Mašínová et al. 2018; Passer et al. 2019). Tubes and microplates with suitable aliquots of test cultures were incubated at 25 °C. Utilization of substrates was examined in PDA and incubated for 7 days. The change in coloration and oxidation and/or assimilation profiles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positives and negatives were scored within 7 days of incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days of incubation. Further incubation and observation on 14th day did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7. Tubes were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days, and the growth (changing turbidity) was documented by visual examination.Preliminary identification based on ITS sequencing DNA was extracted from 7-day grown yeast cultures on PDA incubated at 25 °C using the tissue LEV purification kit with Maxwell-16 MDx automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The ITS region was amplified employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers ITS 1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) (Lai et al. 2007), and Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) (Taylor and Bruns 1999). PCR conditions and sample preparation steps for sequencing are described elsewhere (Blachowicz et al. 2017). The ITS sequences were also included in the subsequent MLSA-based analyses.Whole genome sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 g wet biomass scraped from PDA plates, using a ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit (Zymo Research) and bead beating, followed by a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin) treatment. The quality of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis and quantified by spectrophotometric measurements (Nanophotometer NP80 Mobile, Implen GmbH). Library preparation was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol (Illumina document # 1000000025416 v07). The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5–12 cycles of PCR amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex configuration with dual-index adapters. WGS was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 base pairs (bp) platform with a paired-end module. The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain 2012), for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The genomes for the two novel yeast species were reassembled using the Automatic Assembly For The Fungi (AAFTF v 0.3.3) pipeline (Stajich and Palmer 2019), as follows: (i)The Illumina sequencing reads underwent trimming via the BBDuk module within the BBMap software suite (v 38.95) (BBMap: A Fast, Accurate, Splice-Aware Aligner (Conference) OSTI.GOV); (ii) BBMap was employed to eliminate any contaminant reads, and (iii) the resulting high-quality reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.4 (Bankevich et al. 2012). (iv) Contaminant contigs were identified and removed, using nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) (Johnson et al. 2008); (v) We purged duplicated contigs using minimap2 (Li 2018). Final assemblies were polished, using the Pilon v1.24 software (Walker et al. 2014); (vii) The final scaffolds were sorted by length and the fasta headers renamed for further annotation. The assembly quality was verified with QUAST 5.1.0 (Gurevich et al. 2013) and completeness using BUSCO and its basidiomycota_odb10 database (Seppey et al. 2019).Genome annotation and comparative genomic analyses As described in Chander et al. (2022b), the funannotate v1.8 pipeline (Palmer and Stajich 2020) for fungal genome annotation was used. Masked repetitive DNA content were identified using TANTAN (Frith 2011) using the funannotate mask command. The funnanotate predict command was used for gene content prediction, via both evidence-based and ab initio (i.e. structure-based) prediction pathways. The basidiomycota_odb10 BUSCO database (Simão et al. 2015) was used to find conserved gene models for training the ab initio predictors Augustus (Seppey et al. 2019), glimmerhmm (Delcher 1999), and snap (Korf 2004). The GeneMark-ES was also evoked with the option for fungal genomes (Lomsadze 2005). Weighted consensus gene structure was obtained via EVidenceModeler (Haas et al. 2008) using weigh = 2 in the case of Augustus HiQ models and weight = 1 otherwise. Genes of length < 50aa and genes identified as transposable elements were filtered out of the dataset. tRNAscan-SE was used to predict tRNAs (Chan and Lowe 2019). Finally, the funannotate annotate function was used to annotate genes using Eggnog (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2019), Pfam (Mistry et al. 2021), carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZYme) (Drula et al. 2022), Interproscan (Blum et al. 2021), Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Gene Ontology Consortium 2004), MEROPS (Rawlings et al. 2018), and Secreted proteins (Choi et al. 2010). Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the two yeast genomes via fungiSMASH, the fungal-genome-specific version of antiSMASH (Blin et al. 2021). We next run the funannotate compare function in 7 Naganishia species (which ones) and in 5 Cystobasidium (which ones), to look for genomic trends of the above protein categories in those two groups of fungi. Next, we ran CAFE5 to infer changes in the size of Interpro gene families regarding their phylogenetic distribution using the gene birth and death procedure to infer gene gain and loss of specific yeast phenotypes. Assembled genomes and its respectively annotations were deposited at the  (; Chander et al. 2022a).Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses Following recent multi-gene analyses of basidiomycetous yeasts (Liu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015b), MLSA was used to obtain solid placement of the two yeast strains. The gene sequences of all available Naganishia strains were retrieved from , except for N. tulchinskyi (Bijlani et al. 2022) and FJI-L2-BK-P3T strains, which were obtained from using blast tools (Additional file 1: Table S1). Likewise, the gene sequence of all available Cystobasidium strains were retrieved from , except for the FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T strain, which was obtained from its WGS during this study (Additional file 1: Table S2). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB, and TEF1) with all available Naganishia (n = 20) and Cystobasidium species (n = 21). The individual gene sequences for Cystobasidium and Naganishia datasets were aligned separately using the R package DECIPHER (Wright 2020). Briefly, sequences from a fasta file were extracted and loaded using ReadDNAStringSet function. The removeGaps argument was set to \"all\" to remove all gaps in the input sequences. For this reason, OrientNucleotides function was used to reorient sequences by changing their directionality and/or complementarity to match specified reference sequences in the same set. By default, the first sequence with maximum width was used as a reference sequence. Character string indicating the allowed reorientation of non-reference sequences was set to \"both\" (for reverse complement). The algorithm works by finding the k-mer distance between the reference sequence. The more the sequences look similar, smaller is the evolutionary distance. Numeric threshold giving the decrease in k-mer distance required to adopt the alternative orientation was set to 0.05. AlignSeqs function was performed for the generation of the alignment. The profile-to-profile method aligns a sequence set by merging profiles along a guide tree until all the input sequences are aligned. Guide tree was automatically constructed based on a distance matrix of shared k-mers using the setting guideTree = NULL. iterations = 2 and refinement = 1 were set to specify the number of iteration steps to regenerate the guide tree based and the re-alignment. Thus, the best alignment was chosen based on its sum-of-pairs score. Construction of phylogenetic trees utilizing the seven gene sequences listed above for MLSA was performed via IQ-TREE v 2.1.1 using the concatenation approach (Minh et al. 2020). ModelFinder approach was used for the evaluation of the best DNA substitution model (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017). Ultrafast bootstraps and SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) were assumed for branch support (Anisimova et al. 2011). The tree topologies were then visualized with the Interactive Tree Of Life v5 (https://itol.embl.de/).Whole genome-based phylogenetic analyses Phylogenomic trees based on universal barcodes for fungi were constructed following the PHYling pipeline (GitHub - stajichlab/PHYling_unified: Unified PHYling pipeline for species tree building from annotated genomes; see https://github.com/stajichlab/AAFTF and https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate for assembly and annotation steps). The protein models representing the Tremellomycetes class (for phylogenomic analysis of FJI-L2-BK-P3T) and the Cystobasidiales order (for phylogenomic analysis of FJI-L2-BK-P3T) were downloaded from the Mycocosm portal (Grigoriev et al. 2014). Additional unannotated genomes representing the Cystobasidium and Naganishia species were downloaded from  and submitted to the same gene prediction papiline described above (See Genome Annotation and Comparative Genomic Analyses section). We used the hmmsearch tool from HMMER v3.3.2, to compare protein sequences to the fungi_odb10 database, a collection of benchmarking protein sequences that are conserved across a wide range of fungal species, and identify potential homologous sequences (Simão et al. 2015). The tool utilizes a statistical model of protein sequence conservation to identify the degree of similarity between the query sequence and the protein sequences contained in the database. To create the protein alignments, the HMMER v3.3.2 hmmbuild function was employed. Spurious positions were purged with the ClipKIT v 1.3.0 tool, using the smartgap function. We then generated individual protein Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees employing IQ-TREE2 using partitions from each protein marker; the best protein model was calculated individually utilizing standard model selection (-m TEST option) (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017). Tree reconstruction was performed with the supermatrix approach (Chernomor et al. 2016) and branch fidelity was tested using SH-aLRT (Anisimova and Gascuel 2006) and ultrafast bootstrap methods (Hoang et al. 2018). The final tree for each species was visualized with FigTree v 1.4.4 software.UV-C resistance The evaluation of UV-C resistance was carried out via methods described previously (Blachowicz et al. 2019). Briefly, yeast cells (n = 3 species) were counted using a hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) from 7-day-old cultures grown at 25 °C on PDA. Cell suspensions were diluted in molecular grade sterile water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and ∼ 2 × 104 cells/mL were added to precision-cleaned aluminum coupons followed by drying overnight at room temperature in a bio-hood (Chander et al. 2022a, b). Coupons with dried yeast cells were placed in plastic Petri dishes, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using a Crosslinker CL-1000 (UVP Inc). The lamp was placed above the sample with an exposure time required to produce the following doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/m2. The dose rate was 100 μW cm−2. After exposure to UV-C, 100 μL of 10% sterile polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37 °C for 60 min. Dried PVA along with yeast cells was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular grade sterile water. The PVA extraction step was repeated twice. Once PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in quadruplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 25 °C.TAXONOMY Naganishia kalamii K. Venkateswaran, P. Leo & N. K. Singh, sp. nov. MycoBank: MB 846830. Etymology: After Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, an Indian aerospace scientist in whose honor the species is named. Diagnosis: N. kalamii can be readily differentiated from its phylogenetically closest relative N. albida by the growth at 30 °C and 35 °C, whereas N. albida did not exhibit growth at temperatures higher than 25 °C. Since N. kalamii assimilate imidazole and exhibited growth at 10% NaCl, these tests can be used to differentiate N. kalamii from other member of the N. albida clade.

Among the Cystobasidium species, C. tubakii and C. pallidum were phylogenetically related but differ in assimilation of l-arabinose and cellobiose, and growth in the presence of cycloheximide. Molecular characteristics (holotype): nucleotide sequences of ITS and LSU (D1/D2 domains) rRNA deposited in /EMBL under accession numbers MT704910 and OQ107184, respectively. Ecology: The only known strain was isolated from the cleanroom floor at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC-PHSF).RESULTS Naganishia kalamii Molecular phylogeny Naganishia kalamii belongs to Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, and order Filobasidiales. ITS sequence similarity of the strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T with the majority of Naganishia species was > 98.5% suggesting that the ITS marker alone may not be useful to identify Naganishia species (see also Scorzetti et al. 2002; Fonseca et al. 2011). Furthermore, combined sequence analyses of both ITS and LSU fragments placed N. kalamii in the N. albida clade, in a distinct position next to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T (two substitutions in the LSU). Although the N. albida clade is represented in the literature, collections and databases by an array of strains showing highly variable physiological and biochemical characteristics, the pair-wise distances matrix clearly shows the difficulties to discriminate the members of N. albida clade when only ITS and LSU markers were used (Additional file 2: Fig. S2). This problem was highlighted in the comments to the species by Fonseca et al. (2011), but in 2021 two Naganishia species were described largely based on sequence dissimilarity in the clade (Kachalkin et al. 2019; Tan et al. 2021). However, it is important to note that the analyzed protein-coding (CYTB, TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2) individual phylogenetic trees of gene fragments other than SSU (invariable for the whole clade), LSU and ITS exhibited higher resolution in differentiating the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. S3–S7). Furthermore, seven-loci phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2a) convincingly showed that FJI-L2-BK-P3T occupies a distinct position in the clade with high bootstrap support (100%). The novel species N. kalamii is most closely related to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T, N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926T (type of Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. albida CBS 142T, N. liquefaciens CBS 968T and N. adeliensis CBS 8351T (Fig. 2a). Another species N. nivalis was not included in the MLSA-analysis because protein-coding sequences were not available for the analysis. The tree based on conserved genes from the N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T genome (Fig. 2b) showed that N. kalamii is phylogenetically distinct from N. albida var. albida CBS 142T and Naganishia sp. NRRL Y-1402 that was earlier misidentified as N. albida var. albida. Fig. 2.

The gene fragment lengths in base pairs (bp) are given in parenthesis: ITS (621 bp); LSU (611 bp); SSU (517 bp); CYTB (339 bp); RPB1 (317 bp); RPB2 (1282 bp); TEF1 (1084 bp).

Branch fidelity used two different approaches, Ultrafast bootstraps and Gene Concordance Factors, which were added next to its corresponding branchesGenomic characteristics of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T and comparative genomic analysis The estimated genome size of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T is 27.86 Mb and assembled into 478 scaffolds (N50 = 190,774, L50 = 38) with a largest scaffold as 1,000,601 bp. The GC content is 53.9% and the raw sequences are submitted with an accession #: JAKLLX000000000. A total of 8,085 genes were identified, divided into 7902 mRNAs and 183 tRNAs. We have found 1,904 GO annotated and 6007 Eggnog terms, 2548 Interpro and 4783 Pfam domains, 177 CAZYmes, 219 MEROPS peptidases, 396 secreted proteins, and 1624 BUSCO orthologs. When compared with other Naganishia species, N. kalamii has the highest number of genes (8085) and 7902 proteins products (Additional file 1: Table S4). Among the seven species of Naganishia analyzed, three species belonging to the N. albida clade (N. kalamii, N. albida JCM 2334 and NRRL Y-1402) had similar number of predicted genes and proteins, of which N. kalamii exhibited the highest number of secreted proteins (Additional file 2: Fig. S8) as well the number of peptidases (MEROPS; Additional file 2: Fig. S9) but not CAZymes (Fig. 3). Lowest numbers of CAZymes terms were seen in Naganishia sp. N6 (168; deep sea isolate) and N. vishniacii ANT03-052 (170; Antarctic soil isolate), that were isolated from natural extreme environments.

Serine peptidase, S9 prolyl oligopeptidase (S09X subfamily), and the prolyl aminopeptidases (S33) were the most abundant families detected in the Naganishia species. Moreover, the metallo protease thimet oligopeptidase (M03A), pitrilysin (M16A), aminopeptidase N (M01) and the serine protease d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase B (S12) were found to be overrepresented in the genome of N. kalamii (Additional file 2: Fig. S9). Detailed analysis into CAZy database revealed 49 genes associated with assembly (GT: glycosyltransferase) and 109 (84 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 3 PL: polysaccharide lyase, 22 CE: carbohydrate esterase) involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes (Fig. 3). In addition, 16 genes coding for initial lignin degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 5 involved in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also predicted. According to genome-wide comparison, N. kalamii shared 59 CAZy families with other Naganishia species analyzed. No unique CAZy families have been recorded for N. kalamii. However, the polysaccharide lyase family 36 (PL36) was shared only among the members of the N. albida clade. GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 15 predicted genes in N. kalamii) shared also by the other Naganishia members. GH5 consisted of genes related to cellulolytic activity while genes encoding CE10 family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. Genes involved in the degradation of endogenous fungal cell wall polysaccharides (GH128) and lignin (AA1) were also detected. Since survival of yeasts on UV-C exposure was performed during this study, Pfam and Interpro terms associated with dehydration, desiccation, rehydration and UV resistance have been investigated (Additional file 2: Fig. S10). Results did not reveal significant differences in Pfam terms among the Naganishia species analyzed. Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) were the most presented Pfam terms in all the species. Heat shock protein 70 and dehydration stress-response Pfam terms were also commonly present in all the species analyzed. The psychrophilic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 showed presence of genes involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691). The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms for N. kalamii showed the absence of protein directly involved in the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294). N. kalamii also lack the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791), short coiled – coil protein (IPR019357), and the XPG conserved site (IPR019974) involved in the catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair, but XPG, N-terminal (IPR006085) and XPG/Rad2 endonuclease (IPR006084) are present, both not conserved residues. The only strain exhibiting all the terms involved in the UV resistance was Antarctic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 strain. The profile of fungal-specific transcriptional factors was compared among the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. S11). Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain (IPR001138), fungal-specific TF domain (IPR007219), basic region leucine zipper 2 (IPR004827) and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) were commonly enriched in all the species considered. However, it was not prominent in N. kalamii when compared to the Antarctic strain N. vishniacii ANT03-052 and avian guano in South Africa strain N. randhawae eABCC1. CAFE5 analysis revealed that N. kalamii has experienced an expansion of 10 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 43 Interpro domains (p < 0.05) was witnessed (Fig. 3a). The GO term conversion of the acquired Interpro domains are related to protein N-linked glycosylation and inositol phosphate dephosphorylation biological processes. In contrary, the contracted GO terms are related to regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein folding, proteolysis, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport. This suggested that N. kalamii have lost domains related to the control of transcription as well as protein degradation, folding and transport. Six biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the genome of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T, five of which do not match with any known BGCs. These included three non-ribosomal peptide synthase-like (NRPS-like) clusters, one cluster encoding for a Type III polyketide synthase, and two clusters encoding for terpene synthesis, one of which was identified as the BGC for the synthesis of clavaric acid. Similar sets of BGCs were predicted for the genomes of Naganishia sp. strain N6 and N. albida JCM 2334, with two differences: one, neither of the terpene synthesis clusters were a match for clavaric acid in the genome of N. albida JCM 2334; and two, Naganishia sp. strain N6 was predicted to have a NRPS cluster in place of one of the three NRPS-like clusters (Fig. 4).Cystobasidium onofrii Phylogenetic placement This novel yeast belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Cystobasidiomycetes, and order Cystobasidiales. According to the phylogenetic analysis based on ITS and LSU sequences, C. onofrii is distantly related to C. benthicum JCM 10901T (16 base substitutions and 6 gaps, 97.01% of similarity in ITS and 5 base substitutions, 99.22% in LSU). The similarity of C. onofrii with other Cystobasidium species are shown in Additional file 1: Table S6 and the two ribosomal genetic markers were found to be good to discriminate Cystobasidium species. The individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB, TEF1, RPB1, RPB2, (Additional file 2: Fig. S12–S18; Additional file 1: Table S6) were generated followed by a concatenated seven-loci phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5a) for Cystobasidiales species. All the seven loci investigated exhibited good resolution in delimiting the analysed Cystobasidium species. Based on the MLSA tree, strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T constitutes a well-supported clade with C. benthicum, C. tubakii, and C. pallidum, each of the species representing a well-separated lineage (Fig. 5a). The WGS-based analysis further supported a distinct phylogenetic position of the strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T (Fig. 5b) and formed a triad along with C. tubakii 9A-1–0 and C. pallidum JCM 3780. Fig. 5.

Branch fidelity used two different approaches, Ultrafast bootstraps and Gene Concordance Factors, which were added next to its corresponding branchesGenomic characteristics of C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1Tand comparative genomic analysis The estimated genome size of C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T is 20.99 Mb and assembled into 162 scaffolds (N50 = 616,502, L50 = 10) with a largest scaffold as 3,147,288 bp. The GC content is 48.8% and the raw sequences were submitted with an Accession#: JAKLNA000000000. The final annotation of the C. onofrii yielded a total of 6889 genes, divided into 6831 mRNAs and 58 tRNAs. The genome annotation revealed 2934 GO and 5820 Eggnog terms, 3930 Interpro and 4803 Pfam domains, 172 CAZYmes, 221 MEROPS peptidases, 335 secreted proteins, and 1540 BUSCO orthologs. Comparative genome analyses of Cystobasidium species showed that C. onofrii has the second highest number of genes (6889) and predicted protein products (6831) after C. slooffiae (Additional file 1: Table S7). The genomic annotations revealed that C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T secreted larger number of proteins and second to C. slooffiae among the Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. S19). Similar trend is observed for the number of secreted proteins that are peptidases (Additional file 2: Fig. S20), CAZymes (Fig. 6), and MEROPS classes. However, no significant changes in the number of each group have been observed. Among the CAZymes of C. onofrii, 30 genes associated with assembly of glycosyltransferase (GT) and 87 genes involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes (52 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 5 PL: polysaccharide lyase, 30 CE: carbohydrate esterase) were predicted. In addition, 20 genes coding for initial lignin degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 1 involved in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also noticed. According to genome-wide comparison, C. onofrii shared 52 CAZy families with the other 4 Cystobasidium species while PL Family 36 (PL36) was unique in C. onofrii (Fig. 6). GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 16 predicted genes in C. onofrii) shared also by the other Cystobasidium members. GH5 presents genes related to the degradation of cellulose while genes encoding CE10 family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. CE family 16 is another family well represented in C. onofrii along with C. tubakii and C. slooffiae. Fig. 6.

In total, 221 different peptidases were identified, which were classified within the families: aspartic (13), cycteine (48), metallo (68), serine (76), threonine (19), protease inhibitors (2) and mixed peptidase (1). Serine and metallo peptidase are the predominant families in all the Cystobasidium species. In C. onofrii S9 prolyl oligopeptidase (S09X subfamily) and the prolyl aminopeptidases (S33) are the more abundant terms. S33 includes some hydrolases, which additionally degrade other substrates like lipids. The exo-keratinolytic enzymes M38 and the A01A subfamily members, are found abundantly in C. onofrii compare to the other Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. S20). Pfam and Interpro terms associated with dehydration, desiccation, rehydration and UV resistance have been investigated as stress parameters (Additional file 2: Fig. S21). Results did not reveal significant differences in Pfam terms among the Cystobasidium analyzed. Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (3 copies) (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) are the most presented Pfam terms in all the species. Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response are also commonly present in all the Cystobasidium species analyzed. The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms, seen in the genome of C. onofrii of proteins related to the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294; IPR002060) and DNA-repair (eg. IPR006084). However, C. onofrii lacks the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791) and short coiled protein (IPR019357) but both of these proteins are present in the genome of the Antarctic C. ongulense and in C. slooffiae (Additional file 2: Fig. S21). Fungal-specific transcriptional factors among the Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. S22) showed presence of Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain (IPR001138), Fungal-specific TF domain (IPR007219), Basic region leucine zipper 2 (IPR004827), and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) and are more prominent in C. onofrii (Additional file 2: Fig. S22), when compared with the strains isolated from natural extreme environments (Antarctic soil and deep sea). Data from CAFE analysis of Cystobasidium species showed that C. onofrii has experienced an expansion of 31 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 9 Interpro domains (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a). The expansions were related to acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate, DNA repair, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, nitrogen compound metabolic process, mono-atomic ion transport, phospholipid biosynthetic process, iron ion transmembrane transport, and positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In contrary, the contracted GO terms were related to DNA repair, sulfate transport, and transmembrane transport. A single BGC, an NRPS-like cluster of unknown function, was predicted in the genome of C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T. The genomes of neighboring species C. tubakii JCM 31526T and C. pallidum JCM 3780T also contained a single NRPS-like cluster, with an additional unknown cluster encoding for terpene synthesis predicted for the genome of C. pallidum JCM 3780T. The genome of C. benthicum was not available for comparison.Resistance to UV irradiation of the novel yeasts Survival rates of two novel species and the high-altitude cold-adapted N. onofrii exposed to UV-C are presented in Fig. 7. The cultivability of all three yeasts dramatically decreased due to desiccation before exposing them to UV-C irradiation conditions (Additional file 2: Fig. S23). The survival of yeasts after desiccation was 22% for N. kalamii, 23% for C. onofrii, and 33% for N. onofrii. This observed trend might be not only due to the desiccation but also the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that was used to peel off the dried cells could not be ruled out. The number of cultivable cells after desiccation and PVA treatment were considered as baseline (N0) while calculating the effect of different doses of radiation (N). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Survivability of various yeasts exposed to UV-C radiation (doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/m2. UV-C survival rates calculated using formula: N/N0, where N is the number of cells surviving at any given dose and N0 the number of cells of original seed culture (~ 2 × 104 cells/ml). The ratio of survival rates from three different species are plotted. The gray box shows the effect of desiccation and PVA treatment. The experiments were repeated twiceIn general, all three yeasts displayed a similar resistance pattern up to 2000 J/m2 with a gradual increase of mortality recorded with increasing radiation doses (Fig. 7). Among the three yeasts tested, only N. onofrii exhibited higher resistance (~ 5.5 × 103 CFU at 2000 J/m2 and ~ 4.7 × 103 CFU at 3000 J/m2 [p < 0.05], with 72% of conidia were cultivable after exposure to the highest dosage [3000 J/m2]). Even though C. onofrii (~ 2.1 × 103 CFU) and N. kalamii (~ 2.9 × 103 CFU) exhibited a linear decrease in cultivability up to 2000 J/m2, a significant decrease in viability was noticed at the 3000 J/m2 dosage for both C. onofrii (~ 5.6 × 102 CFU; p < 0.05; Additional file 2: Fig. S23) and N. kalamii (~ 1.2 × 102 CFU; p < 0.005; Additional file 2: Fig. S24). The pink-colored C. onofrii retained 27% of the cultivability after UV-C radiation exposure whereas the non-pigmented N. kalamii was the most sensitive, with only 13% of cultivable cells present after 3000 J/m2 of UV-C irradiation. Exposure experiments were repeated twice and showed the same trends.DISCUSSION Microorganisms associated with NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms might hitchhike on spacecraft surfaces, contaminate extraterrestrial environments, or compromise the life-detection missions. Due to stringent maintenance and cleaning, SAFs can be considered as extreme environments since microorganisms found in these cleanrooms could withstand unfavorable conditions and survive low nutrient availability, desiccation, controlled temperature, etc. Indeed, bacteria and fungi isolated from these SAFs are poly-resistant and have been reported to withstand harsh and unfavorable conditions. Therefore, characterization of yeast species from NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms is essential. The identification of yeasts has been shifted from phenotypic characterization to sequence-based identification and DNA-markers were utilized for defining their phylogenetic affiliation (Fonseca et al. 1999; Scorzetti et al. 2002). Since the 2000s, Naganishia species have been identified by considering differences among ribosomal gene sequences (ITS and partial LSU), which sometimes leads to ambiguous identification in subsequent revisions of the genus (Turchetti et al. 2015; Ruiz and Radwan 2021). Circumscription of the species Cryptococcus albidus has a long and complicated history of splitting and lumping using the ever-growing array of available tests and tools, including whole-cell protein patterns, DNA-DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequencing (Fonseca et al. 2011). The species has long been known as a variable species and included, as varieties, yeasts that are presently placed in other genera and families of Filobasidiales (Fonseca et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015). As the result of reclassification of the C. albidus species complex using LSU and later ITS sequences, many previous varieties were promoted to the taxonomic level of species, e.g. Naganishia diffluens, N. globosa, N. liquefaciens, Solicoccozyma terrea, Solicoccozyma terricola. Delineation of species using a single ribosomal gene region is not always reliable in basidiomycetous yeasts, because different lineages strongly vary in their rates of nucleotide substitution (Fell et al. 2000; Scorzetti et al. 2002). The case of the genus Naganishia is challenging as species were delimited based on very few substitutions in the two fragments, ITS and LSU. Based on ITS and LSU, the albida clade of the genus Naganishia currently include three varieties of N. albida (N. albida var. albida CBS 142T, N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926T (formerly Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T) and three other species (N. nivalis DBVPG 5706T, N. liquefaciens CBS 968T, N. brisbanensis BRIP 28244; Additional file 2: Fig. S1; Scorzetti et al. 2002; Kurtzman et al. 2011; Li et al. 2020). However, according to our results, combined sequence analysis of the LSU and ITS sequences, it is not possible to differentiate members of N. albida clade using the approach due to low discriminatory power and lack of bootstrap support (Additional file 2: Fig. S1). Our results suggest that the recently described N. brisbanensis (Tan et al. 2021) might be a taxonomic synonym of Cryptococcus kuetzingii, the species that have not been included in the original analysis by Tan et al. (2021). To improve as much as possible poor species resolution in the ITS-LSU tree, a seven-loci (MLSA) and WGS-based phylogenies were generated for the discrimination of N. albida clade members. The MLSA tree convincingly separated N. kalamii from the other members of the N. albida clade suggesting that it should be placed in a new species rather than keeping as a N. albida variety which would further increasing the heterogeneity of the species. Furthermore, our MLSA- and WGS-based trees suggest that all the varieties of the N. albida clade are likely to be independent species (Fig. 2a). However, the complete reclassification of N. albida must include (either as the seven-gene dataset, but preferably WGS) recently described N. nivalis and N. brisbanensis, the varieties N. albida var. kuetzingii and N. albida var. ovalis, as well as some present synonyms of the N. albida, namely Torulopsis rotundata and Torulopsis nadaensis (Fonseca et al. 2011). In addition, WGS-based phylogeny of the strains NY-1402, N6, and I2-R1 from public databases revealed that strain NY-1402 is potentially a novel species and two other strains (N6, isolated from deep-sea sediment and I2-R1, isolated from an ISS HEPA filter for a rodent experiment) should be assigned to N. tulchinskyi. These examples show that MLSA and WGS analyses are necessary to avoid misidentification (Taylor and Fisher 2003; Liu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015a, b; Vu et al. 2016). Naganishia strains phylogenetically close to N. kalamii are well-adapted to cold environments. Extreme conditions might have a selective pressure leading to an increase in mutation rates, allowing microbial species to adapt to extreme conditions (Turchetti et al. 2015). Most of the Naganishia species (N. vaughanmartiniae, N. onofrii, N. friedmannii, N. cerealis, N. randhawae, N. globosa, N. adeliensis, N. liquefaciens and N. albida) are able to grow at low temperatures (4 °C) but only N. kalamii and N. qatarensis can grow at 35 °C. All the psychrophilic or psychrotolerant Naganishia species exhibit the presence of cold-adapted genes which might have allowed them to colonize cold environments such as Antarctica and the deep sea (Selbmann et al. 2005, 2013; Turchetti et al. 2015; Fotedar et al. 2018; Han et al. 2020; Segal-Kischinevzky et al. 2022). N. qatarensis, a halophilic yeast isolated from a warm hypersaline marine environment in Qatar, is reported to grow at 30–35 °C (Fotedar et al. 2018). Growth of N. qatarensis at lower temperature (~ 25 °C) has been reported but it took 8 weeks after incubation. Conversely, N. kalamii is able to grow in a temperature range of 15–35 °C after 7 days, and growth was noticed within 14 days when incubated at 4–10 °C. Similar to Naganishia species, the C. onofrii clade consists of three species that were also isolated from cold environments (Tsuji et al. 2017; de Menezes et al. 2019) and other members of the genus Cystobasidium (n = 12 species) are among the most common cold-adapted species (Buzzini et al. 2018). All members of the genus Cystobasidium, including C. onofrii, are psychrophilic or psychrotolerant, with optimum growth temperatures ranging from 15 to 20 °C. Cryosphere harbors abundant microbial diversity, e.g. Antarctica, Greenland, cold lakes in Argentina, and deep sea (Buzzini and Margesin 2014). Cold-adapted yeast species are reported to survive while embedded in the ice layers of glaciers or in permafrost (Zucconi et al. 2012; Turchetti et al. 2013), finding micro-conditions that are isolated from the surrounding environments (Price 2000). Low nutrient availability is another limiting factor typical of Antarctic ecosystems. The oligotrophic Antarctic yeast C. tubakii, which closely related to C. onofrii, does not require amino acids and vitamins for growth, and is also able to grow at − 3 °C (Tsuji 2018). Since future space missions—for example, ESA JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA Europa Clipper missions—are designed to explore the potential habitability of icy moons, the presence of cold-adapted yeasts should be monitored in the NASA cleanrooms. For future missions, monitoring psychrophiles, xerophiles and halophiles in SAFs is of particular interest because they may be capable of surviving inside or under the icy crust of Europa due to its extremely cold and saline environment (Marion et al. 2003). For instance, C. lysiniphilum and C. slooffiae are reported as halotolerant species (Mokhtarnejad et al. 2016). Similarly, C. onofrii shows moderately halophilic aptitude since it exhibits growth at 10% NaCl. In general, SAF surfaces are decontaminated with reagents and also kept dry. Our genomic analysis reveals that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species have predicted proteins (Pfam and Interpro terms) associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response. Halotolerance is another adaptation required for yeasts typically active in hyper-arid regions, and so the halophilic traits detected in the genomes of these species also likely contributes to their survival in the cleanroom environment (Buzzini and Margesin 2014; Logan et al. 2021; Yurkov et al. 2022). As reported by Yurkov et al. 2022, members of both genera Naganishia and Cystobasidium (N. albida and C. minutum) were nearly the only yeasts isolated from hot and dry sandy soil of the Namib desert. N. albida is well-adapted to dry conditions due to a thick polysaccharides capsules, which might be responsible for its remarkable ability to survive in air-dried autoclaved loamy sand (Vishniac 1985). Highly desiccation tolerance has also been reported in N. vishniacii, showing almost 100% survival after 27 days at a relative humidity of < 1% (Connell et al. 2014). Another species of the genus, N. friedmannii tested for desiccation (along with stratospheric low pressure and temperature and UV exposure) during stratospheric balloon flights, recorded larger numbers of viable cells than bacterial spores. Presence of the genetic traits associated with desiccation and oligotrophy were present in N. kalamii and C. onofrii, promoting their presence to the stringent conditions found in cleanrooms. Our genomic analysis revealed that along with genes related to desiccation tolerance, genes related to UV resistance are present in both Naganishia and Cystobasidium members. However, the only strain exhibiting all gene ontology terms involved in UV resistance is N. vishniacii ANT03-052, firstly isolated from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), a terrestrial Mars analogue. We may assume that local physical–chemical parameters of the environment might be one of the evolutionary drivers that induce the stabilization of the genes required to survive in the extreme conditions (Aureli et al. 2023). UV-C resistance may be a critical factor for microbial survival during interplanetary transport. Most work correlates increased UV-C resistance with microbial pigmentation (Kreusch and Duarte 2021). Few studies recognized the existence of non-pigmented yeasts with similar resistance (Moliné et al. 2010; Schmidt et al. 2017; Pulschen et al. 2018; Kreusch and Duarte 2021). Our results showed UV-C survival of the non-pigmented N. kalamii and the pigmented pink-colored C. onofrii at up to 3000 J/m2 UV-C irradiation. Multiple species from the non-pigmented Naganishia species are highly resistant organisms to UV radiation (Pulschen et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2017) and our results are in line with this finding. Indeed, we found that the polar yeast N. onofrii is more resistant to UV-C radiation compared to the pigmented C. onofrii, which is capable of synthesizing carotenoids with UV shielding properties (Moliné et al. 2010). Furthermore, cold-adapted yeasts, such N. onofrii are characterized by a thick cell wall and the ability to produce an extracellular polysaccharide capsule surrounding their cells (Turchetti et al. 2015), providing robustness to the organism when exposed to stress conditions. This adaptation is typically found in extremophiles. Indeed, it is already demonstrated that deinococcal polysaccharide capsule (DeinoPol) has antioxidant properties involved in resistance to severe environmental stresses, including UV radiation and hydroxyl radicals (Lin et al. 2020). During atmospheric transportation, microorganisms must cope up with not only with intense UV, but also low temperatures and dehydration (Selbmann et al. 2005, 2013). The serine proteases of N. kalamii also include some hydrolases which were reported to degrade lipids (Leger et al. 1997; Muszewska et al. 2017). Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) are the most abundant Pfam terms in all the Naganishia species and are usually associated with survival of multiple dessication-rehydration cycles (Gao et al. 2017). Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response were also present in all the Naganishia species analyzed. However, only the psychrophilic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 had genes involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691). Raffinose accumulation is one of the adaptive strategies involved against cold shock (Imanishi et al. 1998; Egert et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2022). By comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation in the different species analyzed, we identified that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species present a consistent number of genes related to a saprotrophic lifestyle of decaying organic and plant materials (PL36; GH5; CE10; GH128; AA1). Moreover, serine proteases S33 and S09X found in N. kalamii, are essential hydrolytic enzymes with several functions such as protein maturation, signal peptide cleavage and transduction, and intracellular protein turnover. Although both are typically understudied in yeast, they have been suggested as a marker for saprotrophy in fungi as they are theorized to be less expressed in fungi with a pathogenic or animal-associated lifestyle (Muszewska et al. 2017). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the relatively high abundance of the aminopeptidases M01 and the serine proteases S12, which are both detected in abundance in the genome of N. kalamii, may be an indicator of saprotrophy (Muszewska et al. 2017). The same trend has been detected in C. onofrii. Furthermore, genes encoding a wide range of glycosyl hydrolases that have the capacity to degrade the major plant cell wall polymers (eg. AA1 for lignin and GH5 for cellulose breakdown) were found in both N. kalamii and C. onofrii. Acetyl esterases, found in C. onofrii, are an important component of the enzymatic machinery for fungal degradation of plant biomass and break down xylan-derived oligosaccharides and on galactoglucomannan (Venegas et al. 2022). In particular, the Acetyl esterases subfamily members are preproenzymes, acting in the lysosomal/endosomal system and may be involved in the external digestion of proteins in saprophytic organisms (Chan et al. 2014). The synthesis of extracellular enzymes which degrade organic matter and release nutrients is crucial for the survival of saprotrophs. However, by comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation of the two yeasts described here, we observed a loss in gene family (PFAM terms and GO-term counts) in both species, which is usually associated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals. It is worth mentioning that the loss is more remarkable in N. kalamii (Muszewska et al. 2017).CONCLUSIONS This study underscores the extreme, oligotrophic conditions of meticulously maintained NASA cleanrooms, which could potentially house various microbes, including significant yeast species. Traditional yeast identification methods are deemed inadequate, highlighting the need for more precise techniques like MLSA and WGS, particularly for complex genera like Naganishia. The study also warns about these UV-C resistant yeasts, including high-altitude, cold-adapted N. onofrii and two other NASA cleanroom species, to potentially contaminate extraterrestrial environments, thereby posing risks to life-detection missions. The presence of these cold-adapted yeasts in SAF bears implications for future missions to icy moons. Genomic analysis further reveals the potential for survival in harsh conditions, pointing to genes linked with desiccation tolerance and UV resistance.Supplementary Information 43008_2023_119_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (1MB, pdf) Additional file 1: Table S1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure.Methods To provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden.Result Telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the space environment persisting months post-flight.Conclusion Our findings provide valuable insights into the physiological consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with telomere dynamics and immune cell gene expression adapting to spaceflight and persisting after return to Earth. CHIP sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the early development of CHIP in astronauts, an understudied phenomenon as previous studies have focused on career astronauts. This study will serve as a reference point for future commercial and non-commercial spaceflight, low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, and deep-space exploration.Keywords: genomes, clonal, hematopoiesis, stability, immune, mitochondria, ribosomes, spaceflight",
    "introduction": "Introduction Human spaceflight frequency has increased over the last decade, and with it, our grasp of its effects on human physiology. Despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. The space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity (e.g. weightlessness), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long-term human presence in space. Additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes (e.g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others [1]. Moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. Indeed, there appears to be a reduction in T cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of TNF-α, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5, etc.) associated with spaceflight [2]. To date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. More recently, however, SpaceX launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. The present I4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post-flight and long-term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. This includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to Earth [3]. Both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. Previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with cardiovascular disease, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and increased overall mortality [4, 5]. The NASA Twins Study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long-duration spaceflight and provided the first measures of telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis in astronauts [3, 6]. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A and TET2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts. A retrospective study of 14 astronauts who flew shuttle missions has also shown an elevated presence of genetic abnormalities in CHIP-driver genes in the astronaut population [3, 5, 7]. Here we investigated immune adaptations, telomere length dynamics, cell-free DNA release, genomic stability, single-cell transcriptomic analysis, and biochemical adaptations of the I4 crewmembers traveling into lower earth orbit over the course of 3 days, to determine the effects of short-duration spaceflight. It is imperative to study these adaptations in this context for future space missions, as prolonged space environment exposure could exponentially increase the rate of mutational burden [8], be it due to the inflammatory milieu resulting from spaceflight or the particular challenges of the space environment, such as microgravity and radiation exposure. Here, we leveraged the I4 mission to examine the development of genetic abnormalities in the astronauts by studying their physiological response to the demands of spaceflight and quantifying the genetic changes that are associated with spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Informed consent and ethics This study was completed following appropriate ethical guidelines according to the Declaration of Helsinki, ICHGCP, and local regulations, as applicable, from each potential subject or each subject's legally authorized representative prior to participating in the research study. The protocol, the ICF, other written material given to the patients, and any other relevant study documentation were submitted to and approved by the appropriate ethics committee. This study was conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by the applicable ethics committees and investigations were undertaken by scientifically and medically qualified persons, where the benefits of the study were in proportion to the risks. All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21–05023569. All crew members provided written informed consent for data and sample sharing. I4 launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A and traveled into Low-Earth Orbit across a three-day mission, reaching an orbital altitude of approximately 364 miles and ultimately splashed down into the Atlantic Ocean. Dried blood spot (DBS) pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight sampling Crew members warmed and massaged their fingertips to maximize blood flow. Fingertips were sterilized (BZK antiseptic towelette, Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303) and punctured using a contact-activated lancet (BD Biosciences, #366 593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305 167). Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva, #10 534 612) were used to capture, transfer, and then store capillary blood with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10 548 239) at ambient temperature. DNA extraction for qPCR-based assessment of telomere length Three 3 mm circular punches were cut from the Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards (cat# WHA10534612) containing blood samples using an Integra Miltex Standard Biopsy Punch (cat# 12-460-406) and placed into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with sterile tweezers. Samples were prepared using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Investigator Kit (cat# 56 504) following the manufacturer's isolation of total DNA from FTA and Guthrie Cards protocol. The quantification of DNA in each sample was determined through fluorometric quantification with the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# Q33238) and the 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q33231). DNA samples were sent to Colorado State University for multiplex qPCR analysis. Multiplex quantitative PCR telomere length measurement MMqPCR measurements of telomere length were carried out by preparing 22 μL of master mix using SYBR green GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega #A6001) combined with the telomere forward primer (TelG; 5′-ACACTAAGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTAGTGT-3′), telomere reverse primer (TelC; 5′-TGTTAGGTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCT AACA-3′), albumin forward primer (AlbU; 5′-CGGCGGCGGGCGGCGCGGGCTGGGCGGA AATGCTGCACAGAATCCTTG-3′), albumin reverse primer (AlbD; 5′-GCCCGGCCCGCCG 4 CGCCCGTCCCGCCGGAAAAGCATGGTCGCCTGTT-3′) at 10 μM per primer (Integrated DNA Technologies), and RNase/DNase free water. Then 3 μL of DNA at 3.33 ng/uL was added for a final volume of 25 μL, final TelG/C primers concentration of 900 nM, and the AlbU/D primers at 400 nM. A Bio-Rad CFX-96 qPCR machine was used to measure telomere length. The cycle design was as follows: 95°C for 3 min; 94°C for 15 s, 49°C for 15 s, for 2 cycles; 94°C for 15 s, 62°C for 10 s, 74°C for 15 s, 84°C for 10 s, and 88°C for 15 s, for 32 cycles. The melting curve was established by a 72°C to 95°C ramp at 0.5°C/second increase with a 30 second hold. Standard curves were prepared using human genomic DNA (Promega Cat # G3041) with 3-fold dilutions ranging from 50 ng to 0.617 ng in 3 μL per dilution. Negative controls included a no-template TelG/C only and AlbU/D only, and a combined TelG/C and AlbU/D control. Samples were normalized across plates using a human genomic DNA standard. Each sample was run in triplicate on a 96-well plate format and relative telomere length was established using a telomere (T) to albumin (A) ratio. Whole genome extraction and sequencing Genomic DNA was obtained from the cell pellet of a cell-free DNA blood collection tube (Streck, cat# 230470) using the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, cat# 51192), and then shipped to Element Biosciences for library preparation. The extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q238253) and 8 samples were prepared using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit and KAPA Unique-Dual Indexed Adapter Kit (cat# 8 861 919 702). The DNA libraries were quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q32854) and sized using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (cat# 5067–4626). The 8 DNA libraries generated with the KAPA HyperPrep Kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat# 830–00003), individually circularized with 0.5pmol (30 μL of 16.67nM) input, and quantified using the kit-provided qPCR standard and primer mix. The libraries were pooled into 4 separate 2-plex pools, each denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part #88–00 001) using 2 × 150 paired end reads with indexing. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument. Whole genome/cfDNA preprocessing Blood and plasma samples were subjected to whole genome and cfDNA short read sequencing as detailed above. Resultant FASTQ files were validated using FastQC (v0.11.9) and MultiQC (v1.13). Read adapters were trimmed at 3′ and 5′ ends for low quality using Trim Galore (v0.6.5), lower quality reads were classified and removed, retaining only those reads with length >= 25bp, and ph read quality >= 20. Reads were aligned against the hg38 human reference genome with BWA MEM (v.0.7.15) and subjected to standard QC and deduplication procedures as a part of Sentieon's TNscope (v202010) DNAseq workflow [9]. Whole genome/cfDNA/single cell variant calling Aligned and preprocessed reads were subjected to the TNScope variant calling pipeline. Calls were filtered using Fisher's exact test and subsetted to SNP variants using samtools (v1.16.1), and filtered by triallelic sites, short tandem repeats, read quality, and read position bias using BCFtools (v1.16). Varient-Effect-Predictor VEP (v107) was utilized for annotation of variants and further filtering based on predicted impact of mutations. Resulting coordinates were processed into allele and gene frequency matrices, and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) suite of packages. cfDNA extraction and sequencing cfDNA was isolated from 500 μL aliquots of plasma from cfDNA blood collection tubes (Streck, #230470). cfDNA was extracted from each crew member from all timepoints (4 crew members, 6 timepoints, 24 total extractions). cfDNA was extracted using Qiagen's QIAamp ccf DNA/RNA Kit and eluted in 15 μL Qiagen Elution Buffer per sample. Yield was measured for each sample using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231). Entire extract volume was used as input for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for cfDNA protocol. Each sample was barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Unique Dual Index UMI Adaptors–96 reactions). Final library was eluted in 30 μL and checked for concentration using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231). Fragment sizes were determined using Agilent's Tapestation 2100 and D1000 reagents and ScreenTape, with resulting average fragment size ∼380 bp (0.25 pmol) of each sample. A total of 24 cfDNA libraries generated with the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat# 830–00003). Each library was circularized individually with an input range of 0.2–0.5 pmol (30 μL of 6.67–16.67nM) based on linear library yields. The final circularized libraries were quantified using qPCR standard and primer mix and pooled into 2 separate 4-plex pools. Each 4-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part #88–00001) using 2 × 147 paired reads with 19 bp UMI/index 1 and 8 bp index 2. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument. Clonal hematopoiesis targeted variant calling Genomic DNA was obtained from the cell pellet of a cell-free DNA blood collection tube (Streck, cat# 230 470) using the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, cat# 51 192). All samples from the testing and validation cohort were sequenced using a custom designed DNA sequencing assay (DB0188, VariantPlex, ArcherDX). This panel captures the nine genes most commonly mutated in solid tumor patients following therapeutic radiation including the full exonic regions of five genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2) and targeted exonic regions of four genes (JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D). Libraries were prepared from 250 ng gDNA using the VariantPlex protocol (ArcherDx Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) which utilizes Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) technology to generate target-enriched sequencing-ready libraries. Following DNA fragmentation ligation with a universal ArcherDx molecular barcode (MBC) adapter is performed, which tags each DNA molecule with a unique molecular index (UMI) and allows for unidirectional amplification of the sample using gene-specific primers. The resulting libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Ilumina), as per manufacturer's instructions. The methods for variant identification are comparable to those in Novetsky et al. 2023 [10]. The variant calling pipeline included UMI consensus building followed by utilizing Mutect2, VarDictJava, Lofreq2, Pindel in parallel for variant identification. Normalization was performed via LeftTrimAndAlign, and a panel of normals of 27 children and young adults was used with a bonferroni-corrected p value to identify true putative mutations in our astronaut cohort. A pileup analysis as performed in Bolton et al. 2020 [11] was used to query variants in longitudinal follow-ups. A variant list was used to scrutinize raw BAM files and the PoN samples, a fisher's exact test and Bonferroni-corrected p value were used to determine a noise threshold. Variants surpassing this threshold in at least one sample were further examined in the remaining samples, and if statistically validated, the variants were aggregated to construct the final variant list. Variant-Effect-Predictor VEP (v107) and SnpEff (v4.3) was used for annotation of variants. Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using R (v4.1.2), Rstudio (v2021.09.2) and libraries (Tidyverse, Dplyr, data.table, ggplot2). cfDNA fragment analysis Fragment size distribution was calculated using the bamPEFragmentSize tool from the deepTools Python package (v3.5.1). Levels of cfDNA (read counts) originating from different chromosomes were normalized by chromosome length and total number of reads in the library generating a Read per Kilobase per Million reads (RPKM) measurement. The fraction of cell-free mtDNA relative to chromosomal cfDNA in plasma was compared and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) suite of packages. cfDNA tissue of origin deconvolution The enrichment of cfDNA fragments from various tissues was calculated by read coverage depletion analysis at transcription starting sites (TSSs) to estimate nucleosome positioning and infer gene expression. The pipeline is described in detail in Bezdan et al. 2020 [7]. The resulting nucleosome periodicity was correlated with (1) per-tissue gene expression reference matrix retrieved from the Human Proteome Map (HPM; Kim et al. 2014 [12]) or (2) individual astronaut pseudo-bulk expression of different cell subpopulations extracted from PBMC scRNAseq dataset. In both cases the tissue/subpopulation-periodicity correlations were ranked by the value of Pearson's correlation coefficient, clustered (utilizing Ward method with Euclidean distances) and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) and ComplexHeatmap (v2.14.0) packages. Single-cell gene expression analyses Longitudinal single cell data was processed in R using the Seurat package (v4.3.0) to normalize, scale and cluster cell populations. Cell identities were determined through computational gating parameters of inclusion based on gene expression of key markers, similar to gating from Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting. CD8+ T cells were selected from the PBMC population by filtering CD3D+ CD8A+ positive cells. CD4+ T cells from CD3D+ CD8A+ cells, CD14+ monocytes from CCR2+ CD14+ cells, CD16+ monocytes from CD14+ CD16+ cells, NK cells from NCAM1+ CD3- and NCR3+ CD3- cells and DCs from CD86+, CD83+ cells. The Seurat package (v4.3.0) was used for normalization, scaling, and differential gene expression analysis of sn-RNA data. Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using R (v4.1.2), RStudio (v2021.09.2) and libraries (Tidyverse, Dplyr, data.table, ggplot2).",
    "results": "Results Telomere length measurement (MMqPCR) We first examined DNA from dried blood spots (DBS), which were collected from the I4 crew members before (L-92, L-44, L-3), during (FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) spaceflight, from which DNA was isolated, and telomere length measured via multiplexed quantitative PCR (MMqPCR) (Fig. 1A). Telomere elongation was observed in all four I4 crewmembers during spaceflight, as compared to their pre- and post-flight normalized means (Fig. 1A). Telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to Earth in 3 of the 4 astronauts (post-flight), and overall continued to shorten over the course of the recovery period. Repeated-measurements ANOVA was performed on the data to assess the overall impact of time on telomere length. Post hoc pairwise comparisons identified pre-flight vs in-flight (P < 0.001) and pre-flight vs R + 1 (P < 0.02) as timepoints between which significant differences in telomere length occurred. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Telomere length dynamics, mitochondrial, and cell-free DNA cell lysis Identity as a function of spaceflight. (A) Telomere length dynamics assessed by MMqPCR in I4 crew members. Normalized analysis shows increased average telomere length during orbital flight compared to pre-flight baseline and in R + 1 compared to pre-flight through Tukey-corrected repeated measures ANOVA (P < 0.001) and (P < 0.02), respectively. A rapid decrease in telomere length was also seen after landing during post-flight recovery months. (B) Autosomes do not show any spaceflight-related change in RPKM (reads per kilobase per million reads), as exemplified using chr21. The cf-mtDNA is significantly more enriched in all samples—significance levels (P-value) of the Wilcoxon test are as follows: Pre-Flight < 0.001, Post-Flight = 0.029, Recovery < 0.001. (C) Observed cf-mtDNA levels show high inter-sample heterogeneity. (D) Tissue of origin deconvolution for circulating cfDNA fragments reveals an increased cfDNA signature of both adaptive and innate immune cells post-landing and during recovery. The enrichment of tissue signatures from the HPM [13] was calculated based on inferred gene expression and nucleosomal footprinting of the cfDNA fragments. Average correlation coefficients (multiplied by -1) over technical replicates are depicted for each sample and time point. The heatmap was subsetted to relevant tissue signatures; extended data is available in Supplememtary Fig. S1 and Table S1, see online supplementary material. (E) Cross-examination of cfDNA origin deconvolution using each of I4 astronaut cell-subpopulation-specific expression markers, derived from peripheral blood (PBMC) dataset, supports the results in D. We note an increased presence of innate and adaptive immune cfDNA in R + 1 and R + 82 when compared to all other timepoints. The extended data is available in Supplememtary Tables S2, see online supplementary material.Intriguingly, despite the short duration of the I4 mission (3 days of orbital flight), these results correlated with findings from the NASA Twins Study (One Year Mission astronaut), as well as with astronauts on ∼6 month missions onboard the International Space Station (ISS) [3, 13]. Cell-free DNA Next, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the I4 crew's plasma was extracted from Streck Cell-free DNA BCT tubes and sequenced to compare to pre-flight baseline, post-flight, and recovery period responses. Extraction and pre-processing of plasma were not implemented during the flight, so all samples were collected on Earth to mitigate cfDNA contamination from apoptotic blood cells during sample transportation (Supplememtary Fig. S1A & B, see online supplementary material) [8]. We analyzed plasma mitochondrial cfDNA (cf-mtDNA) relative to the chromosomal cfDNA fraction (Fig. 1B & C, Supplememtary Table S3, see online supplementary material) as a potential biomarker for long-duration spaceflight adaptations. In this mission, cf-mtDNA levels did not rise significantly following the return to Earth (R + 1), possibly due to the short flight duration. Cf-mtDNA enrichment was only observed in the twin astronauts on the ISS after months of exposure to the space environment. The marker levels display high between-sample heterogeneity, and the increase in pre-flight measurements may be connected to the I4 crew's pre-flight preparation (e.g. high-altitude training). Given that cfDNA fragments encompass one nucleosome (∼150 bp), we inspected depletion in read coverage distribution around the transcription start sites (TSS) as a measurement of gene expression [6, 14]. We applied coverage normalization specific to the genomic neighborhood and completed Fourier transformation to determine nucleosome footprints based on signal periodicity [7]. The cfDNA fragment tissue and cell-type-of-origin enrichment of fragments were correlated with either tissue-specific expression signatures from the Human Proteome Map (HPM) [12] or individual astronaut expression profiles from peripheral blood [15] (Fig. 1D & E, Supplememtary Fig. S1C, Supplememtary Tables S1 & S2, see online supplementary material). The most represented sequences were of hematopoietic origin, while a small increased presence of cfDNA fragments from both innate and adaptive immune cells was observed post-landing and during the recovery period. Interestingly, there was a significant increase in the cfDNA originating from all immune cells in all astronauts over a month following their return to Earth (R + 82), indicating a degree of heterogeneity in cell lysis over time and a possible long-term response. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) assessment While CHIP has been previously studied in astronauts, the I4 cohort provided an opportunity to study the physiological impact of spaceflight in a civilian crew that had never undergone orbital flight. Indeed, the monitoring of this crew provides us with a unique opportunity to understand the beginning of the already established relationship between career astronauts and CHIP. Of note, the NASA Twins Study assessed the mutational burden of long-duration spaceflight in CHIP genes and a retrospective study established a burden of CH-related mutations in the career astronaut population [3, 4] and we sought to examine these same CHIP genes for the I4 crew. To address the variant allele frequency (VAF) of CHIP genes, we performed deep targeted sequencing (>15,000x) of 10 known epigenetic regulators and CHIP-associated genes and assessed the mutational burden of short duration spaceflight in the I4 astronaut cohort. Notably, the mutational burden of the CHIP-associated genes did not change as a function of spaceflight and remained stable for up to 6 months post spaceflight (Fig. 2A). No known deleterious mutations arose in the I4 cohort post-flight, nor did any pre-existing somatic mutations increase in allele frequency significantly (Fig. 2B & C). Putative driver mutations were found in two out of the four astronauts but their VAF remained comparable at all timepoints, indicating stability of the VAF from the spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Targeted deep sequencing of CHIP-related genes exhibit genomic stability and comparable mutational burden as a function of spaceflight. (A) Putative driver mutational burden of CHIP-related genes were found in two out of the four astronauts, longitudinal follow-ups demonstrate stability during the months leading and following spaceflight. (B&C) Variant allele frequency of putative driver mutations (chr2: g.25235778C > G, chr2: g.25234347G > C, chr2: g.25241591C > A, chr2: g.25246732GTCGTGGCACACCGGGAACAGCTTCCCCGC > G, chr2: g.25247647G > A, chr22: g.28734438C > T, chr20: g.32434638AG > A, chr4: g.105275662G > T) in subjects 003 and 004 remained comparable both during pre-flight timepoints and post-flight recovery. (D&E) Comparison of variant allele frequency of TET2.p.Cys1273Tyr mutation in TW (spaceflight) subject of the NASA Twins Study and variant allele frequency of DNMT3A.p.Trp698Ter and de-novo mutation DNMT3A.p.Asp856Gly in HR (ground subject) showed a relative stable VAF during the initial stages of the study but an increased variant allele frequency through a 6 year follow-up period.To give context for these data, we next collected additional samples for both subjects in the NASA Twins Study. Subject TW (long duration spaceflight) presented mutation TET2.p.Cys1273Tyr in a bulk PBMC sample at an increased VAF of ∼ 0.075 (Fig. 2D). Subject HR (ground control) presents the mutation DNMT3A.p.Trp698Ter at an increased VAF of ∼ 0.086 and the mutation DNMT3A.p.Asp856Gly not previously found at a VAF of ∼ 0.05 (Fig. 2E). Both astronauts presented increased clonality when compared to previous timepoints. Their mutational burden was still greater than age-matched controls, as established in the original study. However, the increased mutational burden is an expected finding, given the association between aging and CHIP [16] and there's no evidence of them having any clinical effects to date. Longitudinal comparison of whole genome mutations reveals genomic stability months after short-duration orbital flight To assess the long-term consequences of spaceflight on the genomic stability of astronauts, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and variant calling pre- and post-flight. Comparison of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and indel presence between timepoints (L-44 and R + 45) for each astronaut indicated no significant changes for genes with the highest mutational burden (Fig. 3A), epigenetic regulator genes (Supplememtary Fig. S3, see online supplementary material) or other gene sets of interest. The analysis of variant annotations (Fig. 3A & C) revealed that most identified variants are within intronic regions and have no significant effects. We also have noted no disproportional mutational load for variants post-flight (Fig. 3D). We performed variant calling in single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) libraries and compared it across all timepoints and against WGS for genes with read coverage > 10x (Supplememtary Fig. S3B & C, see online supplementary material). Whole genome coverage of the snRNA-seq libraries varied broadly across timepoints, but did not show any significant evidence of genomic instability within our cohort. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Whole genome sequencing and variant calling reveals genomic stability post-flight. (A) Comparison of variant consequences before and after spaceflight of genes with the greatest mutational burden demonstrates no gene is disproportionately mutated post-flight. We report unique counts of (variant, effect annotation) pairs per gene of interest. (B) De novo mutational comparison elucidates comparable mutational burdens at a genome-wide scale. Here we count variants as unique changes of reference to alternative alleles at a given position regardless of variant annotation. (C) Variant effect annotation for variants called in both timepoints shows most mutations are in non-coding regions. Variant annotations were ranked according to the severity of the variant effect estimated by Ensembl [15]. We report unique counts of (variant, effect annotation) pairs across the whole genome. (D) Timepoint comparison of variant effect annotations across the whole genome shows no disproportional mutational load for variants called uniquely post-flight. Here we show the distribution for moderate to high-severity variants. Spaceflight induces cell-type-specific changes in gene expression profiles We next examined gene expression changes across immune cell types due to spaceflight. Cell type-specific genes were used to filter cell types computationally. CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells were filtered from PBMCs at six different timepoints: L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82. Gene expression of CD8+ T cells at R + 1 and R + 82 showed increased expression of genes related to immune function, ribosomal and mitochondrial activity (e.g. NKG7, CCL5, HLA-C, S100A4, RPL41, RPS11, MT-CO3, PTMA, B2M, see Fig. 4B). Similar trends were seen with CD14+ monocytes, DCs, CD4+, FCGR3A+ monocytes, NK cells, and CD3D+ cells (Supplememtary Fig. S4C & D, see online supplementary material). Increased gene expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes was conserved across cell types for both L-92 vs R + 1 and L-92 vs R + 82 comparisons. PLCG2, MTRNR2L12, VCAN, and MAML2 transcripts associated with immune function, mitochondrial function, cell adhesion, and Notch signaling were consistently downregulated across all cell types (Fig. 4 & Supplememtary Fig. S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression and frequency of specific immune subsets reveals conserved, long and short-term adaptations across adaptive and innate immune cells. (A) Frequency of CD8 T cells expressing genes. (B-E) CD8 T cell volcano plot comparison of differential gene expression in L-92 vs R + 1, L-92 vs R + 82 & R + 1 vs R + 82. (F) Proportion of classical monocytes expressing genes. (G-J) Classical monocytes longitudinal differential expression in L-92 vs R+1, L-92 vs R+82, R+1 vs R+82 & R+1 vs all timepoints. (K) Proportion of dendritic cells expressing genes. (L-O) Dendritic cells longitudinal differential expression in L-92 vs R+1, L-92 vs R+82, R+1 vs R+82 & R+1 vs all timepoints.Interestingly, the proportion of cells expressing these genes does not necessarily change in parallel with total gene expression levels. For example, PLCG2 expression, on a per cell basis, decreased, but the total proportion of cells expressing PLCG2 increased among CD8+ T cells at R + 1 (0.98) vs. L-92 (0.81 +/- 0.07 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.66 +/- 0.04 s.e.), classical monocytes at R + 1 (0.99) vs. L-92 (0.96 +/- 0.01 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.92 +/- 0.05 s.e.) as well as DCs at R + 1 (0.99) vs. L-92 (0.96 +/- 0.01 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.92 +/- 0.04 s.e.) (Fig. 4A, C & E). Gene expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, particularly subunits 2 and 3 (MT-CO2 & MT-CO3), increased across all cell types, per cell, for R + 1 compared to L-92 and R + 82, with no significant change in the proportion of cells expressing these genes. MTRNR2L12 expression was consistently decreased across all studied cell types for R + 1 vs. L-92 but greatly increased for R + 82 vs. L-92 and R + 82 vs. R + 1, suggesting changes in gene expression lasting over two months post-flight in both adaptive and innate immune cells.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The I4 mission is the first study to date to analyze the effect of short duration spaceflight on civilians using a comprehensive multi-omics approach. Our findings, including telomere length dynamics, CHIP-related clonal expansion, WGS genomic stability, cfDNA cell lysis analysis, and immune cell longitudinal gene expression profiling, broadly contextualize the physiological burdens of short duration spaceflight. This study adds key CHIP and genetic data on astronauts, which are limited, and can serve as a reference for future spaceflight planning, short missions around Earth's orbit, and longer-duration missions into deep space. The NASA Twins Study was the first to report spaceflight-specific telomere elongation in humans, with one astronaut experiencing telomere elongation during his one-year mission, rapid telomere shortening upon return to Earth, and telomere length recovery to near pre-flight baseline values over the following months, although many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before were also observed [3]. Luxton et al. reported similar spaceflight-associated telomere length dynamics in 3 unrelated astronauts on ∼ 6-month missions onboard the ISS [13]. It was hypothesized that such dramatic shifts in telomere length dynamics were associated with chronic exposure to the space radiation environment and represented an adaptive response to chronic oxidative damage, specifically to telomeres, whereby the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is transiently activated in normal somatic cells [13]. Cytogenetic evidence of heterogeneous telomere lengths and DNA damage responses were also reported, and—together with our cfDNA enrichment analyses—suggested increased DNA damage and are consistent with space radiation exposure and increased senescence-associated foci. Similar changes in telomere length dynamics observed in the I4 crew as a function of spaceflight indicate that telomere length alterations are fast-acting as associated with spaceflight, even for missions of short (e.g. days) duration. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments, originating from various tissues and the immune system, offer a non-invasive method for assessing astronauts' dynamic immune responses to spaceflight-induced physiological stress. As an emerging biomarker, cfDNA concentration and molecular profile yield valuable insights into stress responses in unique spaceflight environments despite its heterogeneous and sensitive nature. Our study indicates that the impact of short-duration spaceflight on cfDNA concentration in astronaut plasma is subtler than long duration missions, but increased innate and adaptive immune system activity is still apparent. Moreover, cfDNA enrichment from all immune cells persists post-flight, suggesting a delayed response involving immune cell turnover and active DNA repair mechanisms. This phenomenon warrants further investigation as it is imperative for both short and long duration spaceflight to elucidate the temporal changes to immune cell types in order to better predict and prevent future risks. Effects of short and long duration spaceflight on CHIP genomic alterations in civilian and career astronauts In the I4 cohort, we found no relationship between spaceflight and increased CHIP-related genetic abnormalities in the scale of three months after spaceflight. With our deep sequencing targeted probe approach (Mean Depth ∼15,000x), we found putative mutations present in subject C004’s and C003 targeted samples but not C001 and C002. DNMT3A gene mutations chr2: g.25235778C > G, chr2: g.25234347G > C, chr2: g.25241591C > A are all missense variants with a likely low/moderate impact on function. A frameshift mutation, chr2: g.25246732GTCGTGGCACACCGGGAACAGCTTCCCCGC > G, was detected in astronaut 004, as well as a stop-gain function mutation chr2: g.25247647G > A. Although DNMT3A presented the higher number of mutations, CHEK2 presented a missense mutation chr22: g.28734438C > T in C004, and ASXL1 presented a frameshift mutation chr20: g.32434638AG > A in both C003 and C004. However, with a VAF of < 0.02 for all timepoints, although detectable, there is no evidence to suggest a clinical effect on the subjects, that is, spaceflight having no discernible effects up to 3 months post-flight. TET2 exhibited a missense mutation chr4: g.105275662G > T at a VAF ∼ 0.3 in C003. However, putative mutations in CH-linked genes were not found at disproportionate allele frequencies post-flight, nor were de novo mutations seen in the post-flight samples. Although our findings suggest that no pathological genomic alterations occurred as a function of spaceflight in the I4 cohort, further longitudinal tracking of the astronauts will help us discern the long-term effects, if any, of short duration missions. Previous studies of the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis and astronauts has elucidated that spaceflight increases proportion of CH abnormalities in subjects when compared to healthy controls [3, 4]. It is not clear why that is the case, or when in an astronaut's career these abnormalities begin to appear, a key limitation of studying career astronauts. Previous studies have also shown the influence of acute events on the development of CH abnormalities, such as first responders from the world trade center tragedy [17]. Therefore, the I4 mission is uniquely positioned to characterize the clonal dynamics associated with a short-duration flight, and will allow future comparisons between career astronaut CH abnormalities and civilian space travelers. There is an opportunity to study the compound effects of spaceflight between missions on CH abnormalities if one or more of the I4 astronauts returns to space. This can be leveraged for a better understanding of long-term risk and clonal evolution. The space environment is known to be chronically inflammatory as astronauts in previous studies have reported increased inflammation markers with the flight duration [18–20]. In the NASA Twins Study, both career astronauts had increased mutational burden in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2 compared to prostate cancer patient controls. Although only one of the twins was in orbital spaceflight for a year, both twins displayed comparable CHIP-related mutations shortly after flight and for several years of follow-up [6]. We continue to monitor the CHIP-related mutational burden of both astronauts years post-flight. The VAF of mutations found in both subjects has, as expected, increased over time, and a new missense variant has been identified in subject HR in the last 3-year follow-up. This is to be expected as CHIP-mutational burden is known to increase as a function of aging. Both astronauts, however, presented clonal burdens that preceded their age-matched control for over two decades at the time of the original study. The fact that TW (space subject) did not present a greater mutational burden post-flight than HR (ground control), despite the length of his last mission, might indicate that the overall number of flights, rather than their duration, is a greater extrinsic factor for clonal positive selection. The I4 cohort provides a unique opportunity to assess the short and long term physiological effects of a singular spaceflight mission. As civilians, the I4 cohort's physiological findings are likely a better representation of what first-time fliers may expect as we gear up toward an increased human presence in space. Moreover, the longitudinal comparison of point mutations and indels from whole-genome sequencing data supports the results of the targeted deep-sequencing CHIP panel, wherein there is not a significant increase in the genome-wide mutational burden for first-flight civilian astronauts. These results favorably indicate that short-time spaceflight does not contribute to overall increased genomic instability, at least on a timescale of several months post-flight. Extending the analysis to future missions and continuous longitudinal tracking for years post-flight could shed more light on the long-term consequences of spaceflight in relation to its altitude and duration, or for low VAF alleles, as well as repeated exposure of astronauts to space radiation. Finally, we note that transient changes in mitochondrial gene expression were seen as a response to spaceflight across a broad range of immune cells within the I4 cohort. Longitudinal gene expression analyses revealed a conserved trend across both adaptive and innate immune cells that had not been described before in the spaceflight literature. In comparisons between L-92 vs R + 1 and R + 1 vs R + 82 all immune cell types demonstrated increased expression of MTRNRL12, MTRNR2L8, and MT-ND4L in R + 1. MTRNRL12 and MTRNR2L8 are pseudogenes thought to be involved in negative regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis [21]. As such, increased MTRNRL12 & MTRNR2L8 expression could indicate a physiological attempt at regulating increased immune cell death. Increased immune cell apoptosis was seen in our cfDNA analysis, at all post-flight timepoints, providing support to the gene expression alterations seen. Of note, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 gene expression were downregulated post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92) within CD86+ DCs, NCAM+ NK cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD3 delta+ CD8+ & CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4B, D, F & supplememtary Fig. S4B, D, F, H). MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 encode subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, which is involved in the reduction of oxygen to water. Decreases in MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 expression cause significant cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial complex IV deficiencies, which may lead to tissue maladaptations [22, 23]. Most mitochondrial genes return to basal levels of expression in our L-92 vs R + 82 comparison, suggesting relief from spaceflight-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. DCs, monocytes, and T cells showed increased MT-ND4L expression over two months after return from flight. The MT-ND4L gene encodes for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L, a component of the respiratory chain Complex I, a protein required for electron transfer and dehydrogenation from NADH to ubiquinone. Longitudinal changes in its gene expression may suggest that mitochondrial ATP production is altered long after return to earth. However, whether the gene expression is representative of decreased activity of the electron transport chain or if it is a physiological response seeking to restore mitochondrial function due to the hypofunctional aberrant effects of oxidative stress, remains to be elucidated. In the spaceflight literature, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes had increased expression of genes related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial transit peptide, mitochondrial translocation, and mitoribosomes [24]. The NASA Twins Study also revealed transient enrichment of mitochondrial signaling that returned to baseline in the recovery period [25]. Our findings, in contrast, reveal a more complex picture of mitochondrial gene expression changes where some are consistently upregulated across cell types and others are transiently downregulated in R + 1 but return to basal levels in R + 82. Immune adaptations to short duration spaceflight Immune system dysregulation in crewmembers following spaceflight has been consistently reported, revealing adaptive immune system changes and general shifts towards a Th2 T cell phenotype [26, 27]. Space environment exposure leads to suppressed activation and reduction in T cells, along with fluctuations in cytokine gene expression, such as increased TNF-a, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines [2, 27, 28]. Our PBMC phenotype analysis offers insight into alterations within immune cell subpopulations, cell state, and genotype associated with short-duration orbital flight in an all-civilian crew. PLCG2 is known for its role in immune cell signaling by cleaving PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), key second messenger molecules that are involved in immune and growth factor receptors [29]. Additionally, although the exact physiological pathway is not known, PLCG2 has been found to positively affect mitochondrial respiration [30]. Dendritic cells exhibit increased AHR expression in R + 1 vs L-92 (Fig. 4, Supplememtary Fig. S4C), a transcription factor known to promote the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th22 cells [31, 32]. T-helper (CD4+) populations present decreased IL-32 expression (Supplememtary Fig. S4D) in R + 82 time points relative to pre-flight L-92, suggesting the transient changes to adaptive immune function can last up to two months, a finding concurrent with the body of literature of spaceflight research [33]. Immune dysfunction involving cytotoxic T cells is a proposed side effect of space travel [34], associated with an elevated risk of opportunistic infections during spaceflight, such as latent herpes virus reactivation [35]. Short-term exposure to spaceflight conditions may affect innate immune system components, including functional alterations of key immune cell populations like CD14+ monocytes and dendritic cells. Microgravity-induced changes can result in decreased neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity, thus affecting the initial response to pathogens. Moreover, microgravity may alter monocyte maturation and function, which play a critical role in antigen presentation and T cell activation. Kaur et al. (2005) describe that, although the percentage of CD14+ monocytes was not significantly reduced in astronauts following spaceflight, days after landing, the ability of these cells to engulf pathogens, degranulate, and mount an immune response was reduced compared to that of ground controls [36]. Though little is known about the influence of spaceflight on dendritic cell function, their role in inflammation is well characterized as they play key roles in modulating cytokine production, mediating migration, and enhancing antigen capture and processing [37]. Finally, while the long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first-fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures. Of note, the short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post-flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in-flight stress rather than microgravity [28, 38, 39]. Latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights [18]. Similar adaptations occurred during ISS missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact [18, 32], which seemed to be a function of mission duration. A 12-year ISS immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS, such as resupply frequency, improvements in personal communication, exercise equipment, and food quality and variety, suggesting the potential for improved quality of life on the health of astronauts [40]. Such operational and biomedical considerations from earlier missions, as well as the cellular and molecular data shown here, can help future crews and missions maintain crew health and safety, as well as guide efforts for lifetime health studies of astronauts.",

Copyright notice ID: 11022651 PMID: 38634106 Abstract Background The Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure.Methods To provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden.Result Telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the space environment persisting months post-flight.Conclusion Our findings provide valuable insights into the physiological consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with telomere dynamics and immune cell gene expression adapting to spaceflight and persisting after return to Earth. CHIP sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the early development of CHIP in astronauts, an understudied phenomenon as previous studies have focused on career astronauts. This study will serve as a reference point for future commercial and non-commercial spaceflight, low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, and deep-space exploration.Keywords: genomes, clonal, hematopoiesis, stability, immune, mitochondria, ribosomes, spaceflightIntroduction Human spaceflight frequency has increased over the last decade, and with it, our grasp of its effects on human physiology. Despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. The space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity (e.g. weightlessness), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long-term human presence in space. Additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes (e.g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others [1]. Moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. Indeed, there appears to be a reduction in T cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of TNF-α, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5, etc.) associated with spaceflight [2]. To date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. More recently, however, SpaceX launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. The present I4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post-flight and long-term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. This includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to Earth [3]. Both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. Previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with cardiovascular disease, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and increased overall mortality [4, 5]. The NASA Twins Study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long-duration spaceflight and provided the first measures of telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis in astronauts [3, 6]. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A and TET2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts. A retrospective study of 14 astronauts who flew shuttle missions has also shown an elevated presence of genetic abnormalities in CHIP-driver genes in the astronaut population [3, 5, 7]. Here we investigated immune adaptations, telomere length dynamics, cell-free DNA release, genomic stability, single-cell transcriptomic analysis, and biochemical adaptations of the I4 crewmembers traveling into lower earth orbit over the course of 3 days, to determine the effects of short-duration spaceflight. It is imperative to study these adaptations in this context for future space missions, as prolonged space environment exposure could exponentially increase the rate of mutational burden [8], be it due to the inflammatory milieu resulting from spaceflight or the particular challenges of the space environment, such as microgravity and radiation exposure. Here, we leveraged the I4 mission to examine the development of genetic abnormalities in the astronauts by studying their physiological response to the demands of spaceflight and quantifying the genetic changes that are associated with spaceflight.Methods Informed consent and ethics This study was completed following appropriate ethical guidelines according to the Declaration of Helsinki, ICHGCP, and local regulations, as applicable, from each potential subject or each subject's legally authorized representative prior to participating in the research study. The protocol, the ICF, other written material given to the patients, and any other relevant study documentation were submitted to and approved by the appropriate ethics committee. This study was conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by the applicable ethics committees and investigations were undertaken by scientifically and medically qualified persons, where the benefits of the study were in proportion to the risks. All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21–05023569. All crew members provided written informed consent for data and sample sharing. I4 launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A and traveled into Low-Earth Orbit across a three-day mission, reaching an orbital altitude of approximately 364 miles and ultimately splashed down into the Atlantic Ocean.Dried blood spot (DBS) pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight sampling Crew members warmed and massaged their fingertips to maximize blood flow. Fingertips were sterilized (BZK antiseptic towelette, Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303) and punctured using a contact-activated lancet (BD Biosciences, #366 593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305 167). Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva, #10 534 612) were used to capture, transfer, and then store capillary blood with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10 548 239) at ambient temperature.DNA extraction for qPCR-based assessment of telomere length Three 3 mm circular punches were cut from the Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards (cat# WHA10534612) containing blood samples using an Integra Miltex Standard Biopsy Punch (cat# 12-460-406) and placed into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with sterile tweezers. Samples were prepared using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Investigator Kit (cat# 56 504) following the manufacturer's isolation of total DNA from FTA and Guthrie Cards protocol. The quantification of DNA in each sample was determined through fluorometric quantification with the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# Q33238) and the 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q33231). DNA samples were sent to Colorado State University for multiplex qPCR analysis.Multiplex quantitative PCR telomere length measurement MMqPCR measurements of telomere length were carried out by preparing 22 μL of master mix using SYBR green GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega #A6001) combined with the telomere forward primer (TelG; 5′-ACACTAAGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTAGTGT-3′), telomere reverse primer (TelC; 5′-TGTTAGGTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCT AACA-3′), albumin forward primer (AlbU; 5′-CGGCGGCGGGCGGCGCGGGCTGGGCGGA AATGCTGCACAGAATCCTTG-3′), albumin reverse primer (AlbD; 5′-GCCCGGCCCGCCG 4 CGCCCGTCCCGCCGGAAAAGCATGGTCGCCTGTT-3′) at 10 μM per primer (Integrated DNA Technologies), and RNase/DNase free water. Then 3 μL of DNA at 3.33 ng/uL was added for a final volume of 25 μL, final TelG/C primers concentration of 900 nM, and the AlbU/D primers at 400 nM. A Bio-Rad CFX-96 qPCR machine was used to measure telomere length. The cycle design was as follows: 95°C for 3 min; 94°C for 15 s, 49°C for 15 s, for 2 cycles; 94°C for 15 s, 62°C for 10 s, 74°C for 15 s, 84°C for 10 s, and 88°C for 15 s, for 32 cycles. The melting curve was established by a 72°C to 95°C ramp at 0.5°C/second increase with a 30 second hold. Standard curves were prepared using human genomic DNA (Promega Cat # G3041) with 3-fold dilutions ranging from 50 ng to 0.617 ng in 3 μL per dilution. Negative controls included a no-template TelG/C only and AlbU/D only, and a combined TelG/C and AlbU/D control. Samples were normalized across plates using a human genomic DNA standard. Each sample was run in triplicate on a 96-well plate format and relative telomere length was established using a telomere (T) to albumin (A) ratio.Whole genome extraction and sequencing Genomic DNA was obtained from the cell pellet of a cell-free DNA blood collection tube (Streck, cat# 230470) using the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, cat# 51192), and then shipped to Element Biosciences for library preparation. The extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q238253) and 8 samples were prepared using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit and KAPA Unique-Dual Indexed Adapter Kit (cat# 8 861 919 702). The DNA libraries were quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q32854) and sized using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (cat# 5067–4626). The 8 DNA libraries generated with the KAPA HyperPrep Kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat# 830–00003), individually circularized with 0.5pmol (30 μL of 16.67nM) input, and quantified using the kit-provided qPCR standard and primer mix. The libraries were pooled into 4 separate 2-plex pools, each denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part #88–00 001) using 2 × 150 paired end reads with indexing. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument.Whole genome/cfDNA preprocessing Blood and plasma samples were subjected to whole genome and cfDNA short read sequencing as detailed above. Resultant FASTQ files were validated using FastQC (v0.11.9) and MultiQC (v1.13). Read adapters were trimmed at 3′ and 5′ ends for low quality using Trim Galore (v0.6.5), lower quality reads were classified and removed, retaining only those reads with length >= 25bp, and ph read quality >= 20. Reads were aligned against the hg38 human reference genome with BWA MEM (v.0.7.15) and subjected to standard QC and deduplication procedures as a part of Sentieon's TNscope (v202010) DNAseq workflow [9].Whole genome/cfDNA/single cell variant calling Aligned and preprocessed reads were subjected to the TNScope variant calling pipeline. Calls were filtered using Fisher's exact test and subsetted to SNP variants using samtools (v1.16.1), and filtered by triallelic sites, short tandem repeats, read quality, and read position bias using BCFtools (v1.16). Varient-Effect-Predictor VEP (v107) was utilized for annotation of variants and further filtering based on predicted impact of mutations. Resulting coordinates were processed into allele and gene frequency matrices, and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) suite of packages.cfDNA extraction and sequencing cfDNA was isolated from 500 μL aliquots of plasma from cfDNA blood collection tubes (Streck, #230470). cfDNA was extracted from each crew member from all timepoints (4 crew members, 6 timepoints, 24 total extractions). cfDNA was extracted using Qiagen's QIAamp ccf DNA/RNA Kit and eluted in 15 μL Qiagen Elution Buffer per sample. Yield was measured for each sample using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231). Entire extract volume was used as input for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for cfDNA protocol. Each sample was barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Unique Dual Index UMI Adaptors–96 reactions). Final library was eluted in 30 μL and checked for concentration using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231). Fragment sizes were determined using Agilent's Tapestation 2100 and D1000 reagents and ScreenTape, with resulting average fragment size ∼380 bp (0.25 pmol) of each sample. A total of 24 cfDNA libraries generated with the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat# 830–00003). Each library was circularized individually with an input range of 0.2–0.5 pmol (30 μL of 6.67–16.67nM) based on linear library yields. The final circularized libraries were quantified using qPCR standard and primer mix and pooled into 2 separate 4-plex pools. Each 4-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part #88–00001) using 2 × 147 paired reads with 19 bp UMI/index 1 and 8 bp index 2. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument.Clonal hematopoiesis targeted variant calling Genomic DNA was obtained from the cell pellet of a cell-free DNA blood collection tube (Streck, cat# 230 470) using the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, cat# 51 192). All samples from the testing and validation cohort were sequenced using a custom designed DNA sequencing assay (DB0188, VariantPlex, ArcherDX). This panel captures the nine genes most commonly mutated in solid tumor patients following therapeutic radiation including the full exonic regions of five genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2) and targeted exonic regions of four genes (JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D). Libraries were prepared from 250 ng gDNA using the VariantPlex protocol (ArcherDx Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) which utilizes Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) technology to generate target-enriched sequencing-ready libraries. Following DNA fragmentation ligation with a universal ArcherDx molecular barcode (MBC) adapter is performed, which tags each DNA molecule with a unique molecular index (UMI) and allows for unidirectional amplification of the sample using gene-specific primers. The resulting libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Ilumina), as per manufacturer's instructions. The methods for variant identification are comparable to those in Novetsky et al. 2023 [10]. The variant calling pipeline included UMI consensus building followed by utilizing Mutect2, VarDictJava, Lofreq2, Pindel in parallel for variant identification. Normalization was performed via LeftTrimAndAlign, and a panel of normals of 27 children and young adults was used with a bonferroni-corrected p value to identify true putative mutations in our astronaut cohort. A pileup analysis as performed in Bolton et al. 2020 [11] was used to query variants in longitudinal follow-ups. A variant list was used to scrutinize raw BAM files and the PoN samples, a fisher's exact test and Bonferroni-corrected p value were used to determine a noise threshold. Variants surpassing this threshold in at least one sample were further examined in the remaining samples, and if statistically validated, the variants were aggregated to construct the final variant list. Variant-Effect-Predictor VEP (v107) and SnpEff (v4.3) was used for annotation of variants. Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using R (v4.1.2), Rstudio (v2021.09.2) and libraries (Tidyverse, Dplyr, data.table, ggplot2).cfDNA fragment analysis Fragment size distribution was calculated using the bamPEFragmentSize tool from the deepTools Python package (v3.5.1). Levels of cfDNA (read counts) originating from different chromosomes were normalized by chromosome length and total number of reads in the library generating a Read per Kilobase per Million reads (RPKM) measurement. The fraction of cell-free mtDNA relative to chromosomal cfDNA in plasma was compared and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) suite of packages.cfDNA tissue of origin deconvolution The enrichment of cfDNA fragments from various tissues was calculated by read coverage depletion analysis at transcription starting sites (TSSs) to estimate nucleosome positioning and infer gene expression. The pipeline is described in detail in Bezdan et al. 2020 [7]. The resulting nucleosome periodicity was correlated with (1) per-tissue gene expression reference matrix retrieved from the Human Proteome Map (HPM; Kim et al. 2014 [12]) or (2) individual astronaut pseudo-bulk expression of different cell subpopulations extracted from PBMC scRNAseq dataset. In both cases the tissue/subpopulation-periodicity correlations were ranked by the value of Pearson's correlation coefficient, clustered (utilizing Ward method with Euclidean distances) and visualized in R using the tidyverse (v1.3.2) and ComplexHeatmap (v2.14.0) packages.Single-cell gene expression analyses Longitudinal single cell data was processed in R using the Seurat package (v4.3.0) to normalize, scale and cluster cell populations. Cell identities were determined through computational gating parameters of inclusion based on gene expression of key markers, similar to gating from Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting. CD8+ T cells were selected from the PBMC population by filtering CD3D+ CD8A+ positive cells. CD4+ T cells from CD3D+ CD8A+ cells, CD14+ monocytes from CCR2+ CD14+ cells, CD16+ monocytes from CD14+ CD16+ cells, NK cells from NCAM1+ CD3- and NCR3+ CD3- cells and DCs from CD86+, CD83+ cells. The Seurat package (v4.3.0) was used for normalization, scaling, and differential gene expression analysis of sn-RNA data. Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using R (v4.1.2), RStudio (v2021.09.2) and libraries (Tidyverse, Dplyr, data.table, ggplot2).Results Telomere length measurement (MMqPCR) We first examined DNA from dried blood spots (DBS), which were collected from the I4 crew members before (L-92, L-44, L-3), during (FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) spaceflight, from which DNA was isolated, and telomere length measured via multiplexed quantitative PCR (MMqPCR) (Fig. 1A). Telomere elongation was observed in all four I4 crewmembers during spaceflight, as compared to their pre- and post-flight normalized means (Fig. 1A). Telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to Earth in 3 of the 4 astronauts (post-flight), and overall continued to shorten over the course of the recovery period. Repeated-measurements ANOVA was performed on the data to assess the overall impact of time on telomere length. Post hoc pairwise comparisons identified pre-flight vs in-flight (P < 0.001) and pre-flight vs R + 1 (P < 0.02) as timepoints between which significant differences in telomere length occurred. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Telomere length dynamics, mitochondrial, and cell-free DNA cell lysis Identity as a function of spaceflight. (A) Telomere length dynamics assessed by MMqPCR in I4 crew members. Normalized analysis shows increased average telomere length during orbital flight compared to pre-flight baseline and in R + 1 compared to pre-flight through Tukey-corrected repeated measures ANOVA (P < 0.001) and (P < 0.02), respectively. A rapid decrease in telomere length was also seen after landing during post-flight recovery months. (B) Autosomes do not show any spaceflight-related change in RPKM (reads per kilobase per million reads), as exemplified using chr21. The cf-mtDNA is significantly more enriched in all samples—significance levels (P-value) of the Wilcoxon test are as follows: Pre-Flight < 0.001, Post-Flight = 0.029, Recovery < 0.001. (C) Observed cf-mtDNA levels show high inter-sample heterogeneity. (D) Tissue of origin deconvolution for circulating cfDNA fragments reveals an increased cfDNA signature of both adaptive and innate immune cells post-landing and during recovery. The enrichment of tissue signatures from the HPM [13] was calculated based on inferred gene expression and nucleosomal footprinting of the cfDNA fragments. Average correlation coefficients (multiplied by -1) over technical replicates are depicted for each sample and time point. The heatmap was subsetted to relevant tissue signatures; extended data is available in Supplememtary Fig. S1 and Table S1, see online supplementary material. (E) Cross-examination of cfDNA origin deconvolution using each of I4 astronaut cell-subpopulation-specific expression markers, derived from peripheral blood (PBMC) dataset, supports the results in D. We note an increased presence of innate and adaptive immune cfDNA in R + 1 and R + 82 when compared to all other timepoints. The extended data is available in Supplememtary Tables S2, see online supplementary material.Intriguingly, despite the short duration of the I4 mission (3 days of orbital flight), these results correlated with findings from the NASA Twins Study (One Year Mission astronaut), as well as with astronauts on ∼6 month missions onboard the International Space Station (ISS) [3, 13].Cell-free DNA Next, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the I4 crew's plasma was extracted from Streck Cell-free DNA BCT tubes and sequenced to compare to pre-flight baseline, post-flight, and recovery period responses. Extraction and pre-processing of plasma were not implemented during the flight, so all samples were collected on Earth to mitigate cfDNA contamination from apoptotic blood cells during sample transportation (Supplememtary Fig. S1A & B, see online supplementary material) [8]. We analyzed plasma mitochondrial cfDNA (cf-mtDNA) relative to the chromosomal cfDNA fraction (Fig. 1B & C, Supplememtary Table S3, see online supplementary material) as a potential biomarker for long-duration spaceflight adaptations. In this mission, cf-mtDNA levels did not rise significantly following the return to Earth (R + 1), possibly due to the short flight duration. Cf-mtDNA enrichment was only observed in the twin astronauts on the ISS after months of exposure to the space environment. The marker levels display high between-sample heterogeneity, and the increase in pre-flight measurements may be connected to the I4 crew's pre-flight preparation (e.g. high-altitude training). Given that cfDNA fragments encompass one nucleosome (∼150 bp), we inspected depletion in read coverage distribution around the transcription start sites (TSS) as a measurement of gene expression [6, 14]. We applied coverage normalization specific to the genomic neighborhood and completed Fourier transformation to determine nucleosome footprints based on signal periodicity [7]. The cfDNA fragment tissue and cell-type-of-origin enrichment of fragments were correlated with either tissue-specific expression signatures from the Human Proteome Map (HPM) [12] or individual astronaut expression profiles from peripheral blood [15] (Fig. 1D & E, Supplememtary Fig. S1C, Supplememtary Tables S1 & S2, see online supplementary material). The most represented sequences were of hematopoietic origin, while a small increased presence of cfDNA fragments from both innate and adaptive immune cells was observed post-landing and during the recovery period. Interestingly, there was a significant increase in the cfDNA originating from all immune cells in all astronauts over a month following their return to Earth (R + 82), indicating a degree of heterogeneity in cell lysis over time and a possible long-term response.Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) assessment While CHIP has been previously studied in astronauts, the I4 cohort provided an opportunity to study the physiological impact of spaceflight in a civilian crew that had never undergone orbital flight. Indeed, the monitoring of this crew provides us with a unique opportunity to understand the beginning of the already established relationship between career astronauts and CHIP. Of note, the NASA Twins Study assessed the mutational burden of long-duration spaceflight in CHIP genes and a retrospective study established a burden of CH-related mutations in the career astronaut population [3, 4] and we sought to examine these same CHIP genes for the I4 crew. To address the variant allele frequency (VAF) of CHIP genes, we performed deep targeted sequencing (>15,000x) of 10 known epigenetic regulators and CHIP-associated genes and assessed the mutational burden of short duration spaceflight in the I4 astronaut cohort. Notably, the mutational burden of the CHIP-associated genes did not change as a function of spaceflight and remained stable for up to 6 months post spaceflight (Fig. 2A). No known deleterious mutations arose in the I4 cohort post-flight, nor did any pre-existing somatic mutations increase in allele frequency significantly (Fig. 2B & C). Putative driver mutations were found in two out of the four astronauts but their VAF remained comparable at all timepoints, indicating stability of the VAF from the spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Targeted deep sequencing of CHIP-related genes exhibit genomic stability and comparable mutational burden as a function of spaceflight. (A) Putative driver mutational burden of CHIP-related genes were found in two out of the four astronauts, longitudinal follow-ups demonstrate stability during the months leading and following spaceflight. (B&C) Variant allele frequency of putative driver mutations (chr2: g.25235778C > G, chr2: g.25234347G > C, chr2: g.25241591C > A, chr2: g.25246732GTCGTGGCACACCGGGAACAGCTTCCCCGC > G, chr2: g.25247647G > A, chr22: g.28734438C > T, chr20: g.32434638AG > A, chr4: g.105275662G > T) in subjects 003 and 004 remained comparable both during pre-flight timepoints and post-flight recovery. (D&E) Comparison of variant allele frequency of TET2.p.Cys1273Tyr mutation in TW (spaceflight) subject of the NASA Twins Study and variant allele frequency of DNMT3A.p.Trp698Ter and de-novo mutation DNMT3A.p.Asp856Gly in HR (ground subject) showed a relative stable VAF during the initial stages of the study but an increased variant allele frequency through a 6 year follow-up period.To give context for these data, we next collected additional samples for both subjects in the NASA Twins Study. Subject TW (long duration spaceflight) presented mutation TET2.p.Cys1273Tyr in a bulk PBMC sample at an increased VAF of ∼ 0.075 (Fig. 2D). Subject HR (ground control) presents the mutation DNMT3A.p.Trp698Ter at an increased VAF of ∼ 0.086 and the mutation DNMT3A.p.Asp856Gly not previously found at a VAF of ∼ 0.05 (Fig. 2E). Both astronauts presented increased clonality when compared to previous timepoints. Their mutational burden was still greater than age-matched controls, as established in the original study. However, the increased mutational burden is an expected finding, given the association between aging and CHIP [16] and there's no evidence of them having any clinical effects to date.Longitudinal comparison of whole genome mutations reveals genomic stability months after short-duration orbital flight To assess the long-term consequences of spaceflight on the genomic stability of astronauts, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and variant calling pre- and post-flight. Comparison of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and indel presence between timepoints (L-44 and R + 45) for each astronaut indicated no significant changes for genes with the highest mutational burden (Fig. 3A), epigenetic regulator genes (Supplememtary Fig. S3, see online supplementary material) or other gene sets of interest. The analysis of variant annotations (Fig. 3A & C) revealed that most identified variants are within intronic regions and have no significant effects. We also have noted no disproportional mutational load for variants post-flight (Fig. 3D). We performed variant calling in single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) libraries and compared it across all timepoints and against WGS for genes with read coverage > 10x (Supplememtary Fig. S3B & C, see online supplementary material). Whole genome coverage of the snRNA-seq libraries varied broadly across timepoints, but did not show any significant evidence of genomic instability within our cohort. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Whole genome sequencing and variant calling reveals genomic stability post-flight. (A) Comparison of variant consequences before and after spaceflight of genes with the greatest mutational burden demonstrates no gene is disproportionately mutated post-flight. We report unique counts of (variant, effect annotation) pairs per gene of interest. (B) De novo mutational comparison elucidates comparable mutational burdens at a genome-wide scale. Here we count variants as unique changes of reference to alternative alleles at a given position regardless of variant annotation. (C) Variant effect annotation for variants called in both timepoints shows most mutations are in non-coding regions. Variant annotations were ranked according to the severity of the variant effect estimated by Ensembl [15]. We report unique counts of (variant, effect annotation) pairs across the whole genome. (D) Timepoint comparison of variant effect annotations across the whole genome shows no disproportional mutational load for variants called uniquely post-flight. Here we show the distribution for moderate to high-severity variants.Spaceflight induces cell-type-specific changes in gene expression profiles We next examined gene expression changes across immune cell types due to spaceflight. Cell type-specific genes were used to filter cell types computationally. CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells were filtered from PBMCs at six different timepoints: L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82. Gene expression of CD8+ T cells at R + 1 and R + 82 showed increased expression of genes related to immune function, ribosomal and mitochondrial activity (e.g. NKG7, CCL5, HLA-C, S100A4, RPL41, RPS11, MT-CO3, PTMA, B2M, see Fig. 4B). Similar trends were seen with CD14+ monocytes, DCs, CD4+, FCGR3A+ monocytes, NK cells, and CD3D+ cells (Supplememtary Fig. S4C & D, see online supplementary material). Increased gene expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes was conserved across cell types for both L-92 vs R + 1 and L-92 vs R + 82 comparisons. PLCG2, MTRNR2L12, VCAN, and MAML2 transcripts associated with immune function, mitochondrial function, cell adhesion, and Notch signaling were consistently downregulated across all cell types (Fig. 4 & Supplememtary Fig. S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression and frequency of specific immune subsets reveals conserved, long and short-term adaptations across adaptive and innate immune cells. (A) Frequency of CD8 T cells expressing genes. (B-E) CD8 T cell volcano plot comparison of differential gene expression in L-92 vs R + 1, L-92 vs R + 82 & R + 1 vs R + 82. (F) Proportion of classical monocytes expressing genes. (G-J) Classical monocytes longitudinal differential expression in L-92 vs R+1, L-92 vs R+82, R+1 vs R+82 & R+1 vs all timepoints. (K) Proportion of dendritic cells expressing genes. (L-O) Dendritic cells longitudinal differential expression in L-92 vs R+1, L-92 vs R+82, R+1 vs R+82 & R+1 vs all timepoints.Interestingly, the proportion of cells expressing these genes does not necessarily change in parallel with total gene expression levels. For example, PLCG2 expression, on a per cell basis, decreased, but the total proportion of cells expressing PLCG2 increased among CD8+ T cells at R + 1 (0.98) vs. L-92 (0.81 +/- 0.07 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.66 +/- 0.04 s.e.), classical monocytes at R + 1 (0.99) vs. L-92 (0.96 +/- 0.01 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.92 +/- 0.05 s.e.) as well as DCs at R + 1 (0.99) vs. L-92 (0.96 +/- 0.01 s.e.) and R + 1 vs. R + 82 (0.92 +/- 0.04 s.e.) (Fig. 4A, C & E). Gene expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, particularly subunits 2 and 3 (MT-CO2 & MT-CO3), increased across all cell types, per cell, for R + 1 compared to L-92 and R + 82, with no significant change in the proportion of cells expressing these genes. MTRNR2L12 expression was consistently decreased across all studied cell types for R + 1 vs. L-92 but greatly increased for R + 82 vs. L-92 and R + 82 vs. R + 1, suggesting changes in gene expression lasting over two months post-flight in both adaptive and innate immune cells.Discussion The I4 mission is the first study to date to analyze the effect of short duration spaceflight on civilians using a comprehensive multi-omics approach. Our findings, including telomere length dynamics, CHIP-related clonal expansion, WGS genomic stability, cfDNA cell lysis analysis, and immune cell longitudinal gene expression profiling, broadly contextualize the physiological burdens of short duration spaceflight. This study adds key CHIP and genetic data on astronauts, which are limited, and can serve as a reference for future spaceflight planning, short missions around Earth's orbit, and longer-duration missions into deep space. The NASA Twins Study was the first to report spaceflight-specific telomere elongation in humans, with one astronaut experiencing telomere elongation during his one-year mission, rapid telomere shortening upon return to Earth, and telomere length recovery to near pre-flight baseline values over the following months, although many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before were also observed [3]. Luxton et al. reported similar spaceflight-associated telomere length dynamics in 3 unrelated astronauts on ∼ 6-month missions onboard the ISS [13]. It was hypothesized that such dramatic shifts in telomere length dynamics were associated with chronic exposure to the space radiation environment and represented an adaptive response to chronic oxidative damage, specifically to telomeres, whereby the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is transiently activated in normal somatic cells [13]. Cytogenetic evidence of heterogeneous telomere lengths and DNA damage responses were also reported, and—together with our cfDNA enrichment analyses—suggested increased DNA damage and are consistent with space radiation exposure and increased senescence-associated foci. Similar changes in telomere length dynamics observed in the I4 crew as a function of spaceflight indicate that telomere length alterations are fast-acting as associated with spaceflight, even for missions of short (e.g. days) duration. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments, originating from various tissues and the immune system, offer a non-invasive method for assessing astronauts' dynamic immune responses to spaceflight-induced physiological stress. As an emerging biomarker, cfDNA concentration and molecular profile yield valuable insights into stress responses in unique spaceflight environments despite its heterogeneous and sensitive nature. Our study indicates that the impact of short-duration spaceflight on cfDNA concentration in astronaut plasma is subtler than long duration missions, but increased innate and adaptive immune system activity is still apparent. Moreover, cfDNA enrichment from all immune cells persists post-flight, suggesting a delayed response involving immune cell turnover and active DNA repair mechanisms. This phenomenon warrants further investigation as it is imperative for both short and long duration spaceflight to elucidate the temporal changes to immune cell types in order to better predict and prevent future risks. Effects of short and long duration spaceflight on CHIP genomic alterations in civilian and career astronauts In the I4 cohort, we found no relationship between spaceflight and increased CHIP-related genetic abnormalities in the scale of three months after spaceflight. With our deep sequencing targeted probe approach (Mean Depth ∼15,000x), we found putative mutations present in subject C004’s and C003 targeted samples but not C001 and C002. DNMT3A gene mutations chr2: g.25235778C > G, chr2: g.25234347G > C, chr2: g.25241591C > A are all missense variants with a likely low/moderate impact on function. A frameshift mutation, chr2: g.25246732GTCGTGGCACACCGGGAACAGCTTCCCCGC > G, was detected in astronaut 004, as well as a stop-gain function mutation chr2: g.25247647G > A. Although DNMT3A presented the higher number of mutations, CHEK2 presented a missense mutation chr22: g.28734438C > T in C004, and ASXL1 presented a frameshift mutation chr20: g.32434638AG > A in both C003 and C004. However, with a VAF of < 0.02 for all timepoints, although detectable, there is no evidence to suggest a clinical effect on the subjects, that is, spaceflight having no discernible effects up to 3 months post-flight. TET2 exhibited a missense mutation chr4: g.105275662G > T at a VAF ∼ 0.3 in C003. However, putative mutations in CH-linked genes were not found at disproportionate allele frequencies post-flight, nor were de novo mutations seen in the post-flight samples. Although our findings suggest that no pathological genomic alterations occurred as a function of spaceflight in the I4 cohort, further longitudinal tracking of the astronauts will help us discern the long-term effects, if any, of short duration missions. Previous studies of the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis and astronauts has elucidated that spaceflight increases proportion of CH abnormalities in subjects when compared to healthy controls [3, 4]. It is not clear why that is the case, or when in an astronaut's career these abnormalities begin to appear, a key limitation of studying career astronauts. Previous studies have also shown the influence of acute events on the development of CH abnormalities, such as first responders from the world trade center tragedy [17]. Therefore, the I4 mission is uniquely positioned to characterize the clonal dynamics associated with a short-duration flight, and will allow future comparisons between career astronaut CH abnormalities and civilian space travelers. There is an opportunity to study the compound effects of spaceflight between missions on CH abnormalities if one or more of the I4 astronauts returns to space. This can be leveraged for a better understanding of long-term risk and clonal evolution. The space environment is known to be chronically inflammatory as astronauts in previous studies have reported increased inflammation markers with the flight duration [18–20]. In the NASA Twins Study, both career astronauts had increased mutational burden in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2 compared to prostate cancer patient controls. Although only one of the twins was in orbital spaceflight for a year, both twins displayed comparable CHIP-related mutations shortly after flight and for several years of follow-up [6]. We continue to monitor the CHIP-related mutational burden of both astronauts years post-flight. The VAF of mutations found in both subjects has, as expected, increased over time, and a new missense variant has been identified in subject HR in the last 3-year follow-up. This is to be expected as CHIP-mutational burden is known to increase as a function of aging. Both astronauts, however, presented clonal burdens that preceded their age-matched control for over two decades at the time of the original study. The fact that TW (space subject) did not present a greater mutational burden post-flight than HR (ground control), despite the length of his last mission, might indicate that the overall number of flights, rather than their duration, is a greater extrinsic factor for clonal positive selection. The I4 cohort provides a unique opportunity to assess the short and long term physiological effects of a singular spaceflight mission. As civilians, the I4 cohort's physiological findings are likely a better representation of what first-time fliers may expect as we gear up toward an increased human presence in space. Moreover, the longitudinal comparison of point mutations and indels from whole-genome sequencing data supports the results of the targeted deep-sequencing CHIP panel, wherein there is not a significant increase in the genome-wide mutational burden for first-flight civilian astronauts. These results favorably indicate that short-time spaceflight does not contribute to overall increased genomic instability, at least on a timescale of several months post-flight. Extending the analysis to future missions and continuous longitudinal tracking for years post-flight could shed more light on the long-term consequences of spaceflight in relation to its altitude and duration, or for low VAF alleles, as well as repeated exposure of astronauts to space radiation. Finally, we note that transient changes in mitochondrial gene expression were seen as a response to spaceflight across a broad range of immune cells within the I4 cohort. Longitudinal gene expression analyses revealed a conserved trend across both adaptive and innate immune cells that had not been described before in the spaceflight literature. In comparisons between L-92 vs R + 1 and R + 1 vs R + 82 all immune cell types demonstrated increased expression of MTRNRL12, MTRNR2L8, and MT-ND4L in R + 1. MTRNRL12 and MTRNR2L8 are pseudogenes thought to be involved in negative regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis [21]. As such, increased MTRNRL12 & MTRNR2L8 expression could indicate a physiological attempt at regulating increased immune cell death. Increased immune cell apoptosis was seen in our cfDNA analysis, at all post-flight timepoints, providing support to the gene expression alterations seen. Of note, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 gene expression were downregulated post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92) within CD86+ DCs, NCAM+ NK cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD3 delta+ CD8+ & CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4B, D, F & supplememtary Fig. S4B, D, F, H). MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 encode subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, which is involved in the reduction of oxygen to water. Decreases in MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 expression cause significant cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial complex IV deficiencies, which may lead to tissue maladaptations [22, 23]. Most mitochondrial genes return to basal levels of expression in our L-92 vs R + 82 comparison, suggesting relief from spaceflight-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. DCs, monocytes, and T cells showed increased MT-ND4L expression over two months after return from flight. The MT-ND4L gene encodes for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L, a component of the respiratory chain Complex I, a protein required for electron transfer and dehydrogenation from NADH to ubiquinone. Longitudinal changes in its gene expression may suggest that mitochondrial ATP production is altered long after return to earth. However, whether the gene expression is representative of decreased activity of the electron transport chain or if it is a physiological response seeking to restore mitochondrial function due to the hypofunctional aberrant effects of oxidative stress, remains to be elucidated. In the spaceflight literature, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes had increased expression of genes related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial transit peptide, mitochondrial translocation, and mitoribosomes [24]. The NASA Twins Study also revealed transient enrichment of mitochondrial signaling that returned to baseline in the recovery period [25]. Our findings, in contrast, reveal a more complex picture of mitochondrial gene expression changes where some are consistently upregulated across cell types and others are transiently downregulated in R + 1 but return to basal levels in R + 82.Immune adaptations to short duration spaceflight Immune system dysregulation in crewmembers following spaceflight has been consistently reported, revealing adaptive immune system changes and general shifts towards a Th2 T cell phenotype [26, 27]. Space environment exposure leads to suppressed activation and reduction in T cells, along with fluctuations in cytokine gene expression, such as increased TNF-a, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines [2, 27, 28]. Our PBMC phenotype analysis offers insight into alterations within immune cell subpopulations, cell state, and genotype associated with short-duration orbital flight in an all-civilian crew. PLCG2 is known for its role in immune cell signaling by cleaving PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), key second messenger molecules that are involved in immune and growth factor receptors [29]. Additionally, although the exact physiological pathway is not known, PLCG2 has been found to positively affect mitochondrial respiration [30]. Dendritic cells exhibit increased AHR expression in R + 1 vs L-92 (Fig. 4, Supplememtary Fig. S4C), a transcription factor known to promote the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th22 cells [31, 32]. T-helper (CD4+) populations present decreased IL-32 expression (Supplememtary Fig. S4D) in R + 82 time points relative to pre-flight L-92, suggesting the transient changes to adaptive immune function can last up to two months, a finding concurrent with the body of literature of spaceflight research [33]. Immune dysfunction involving cytotoxic T cells is a proposed side effect of space travel [34], associated with an elevated risk of opportunistic infections during spaceflight, such as latent herpes virus reactivation [35]. Short-term exposure to spaceflight conditions may affect innate immune system components, including functional alterations of key immune cell populations like CD14+ monocytes and dendritic cells. Microgravity-induced changes can result in decreased neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity, thus affecting the initial response to pathogens. Moreover, microgravity may alter monocyte maturation and function, which play a critical role in antigen presentation and T cell activation. Kaur et al. (2005) describe that, although the percentage of CD14+ monocytes was not significantly reduced in astronauts following spaceflight, days after landing, the ability of these cells to engulf pathogens, degranulate, and mount an immune response was reduced compared to that of ground controls [36]. Though little is known about the influence of spaceflight on dendritic cell function, their role in inflammation is well characterized as they play key roles in modulating cytokine production, mediating migration, and enhancing antigen capture and processing [37]. Finally, while the long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first-fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures. Of note, the short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post-flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in-flight stress rather than microgravity [28, 38, 39]. Latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights [18]. Similar adaptations occurred during ISS missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact [18, 32], which seemed to be a function of mission duration. A 12-year ISS immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS, such as resupply frequency, improvements in personal communication, exercise equipment, and food quality and variety, suggesting the potential for improved quality of life on the health of astronauts [40]. Such operational and biomedical considerations from earlier missions, as well as the cellular and molecular data shown here, can help future crews and missions maintain crew health and safety, as well as guide efforts for lifetime health studies of astronauts.Conflict of interest Christopher E.

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology. Subject terms: Computational biology and bioinformatics, Biological techniques",
    "introduction": "Introduction The increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceflight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)1–3 provides open and FAIR4 access to spaceflight and space-relevant biological studies from the past decades. Research enabled by OSDR data has revealed a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants to mammals (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html). Most prior research using OSDR data has focused on model organisms such as rodents, worms, and fruit flies. These valuable measurements provide insight into the response of neuromuscular, immune, and developmental biosystems to the stressors and hazards of spaceflight. Integrating human in vivo data takes these studies one step further and map previously characterized model organisms’ biological responses to the limited knowledge on human physiology in space. The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In the current special Nature package titled “The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,” a wide battery of analyses of these data have already provided valuable insights (Mason et al., Nature. 2023). The I4 mission stands as a significant milestone, amassing an extensive collection of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, thereby adding an invaluable series of datasets for deciphering the repercussions of spaceflight on human health. The open access of these datasets in the NASA OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, citizen scientists, researchers, and students to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. In this short article, we guide the readers on how to best conduct future analysis by presenting a series of vignettes illustrating pathways for accessing metadata and data from this rich resource through OSDR. We hope these guidelines will help the community contribute further to the vast compendium of findings already published from OSDR data and enable new hypotheses to be tested with both the human and model organism data. Compared to traditional model organisms used for research, one unique aspect of these data is the breadth of longitudinal measurements available from several human astronauts. Such temporal information for several individuals is unprecedented and pushes further the well-known “NASA’s Twin Study”5 where a single astronaut was monitored over 340 days on the international space station, referred to as a “N of 1” experiment. In contrast, even though the duration of the I4 mission was much shorter (3 days), it was at a higher altitude (590 km vs. 420 km), and since it featured four individuals monitored with such biological depth, the data opens the door to new and innovative follow-up studies (e.g. Polaris Dawn missions). Incorporating environmental data with microbiome data and a wide variety of phenotypic and high-throughput sequencing assays provides a rare opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessment of short-term and long-term spaceflight effects on humans. These datasets also provide a much-needed ability to compare human spaceflight effects to the previously characterized spaceflight consequences in model organisms. The analyses conducted thus far on the I4 mission’s data have already yielded substantial revelations, shedding light on the intricate interplay between space stressors and the immune system, cell-specific responses to spaceflight, rapid microbial interchange of the crew, and detailed maps of the changes in the skin from astronauts (Overbey et al., Nature 2023; Tierney et al., Nature Microbiology 2023; Kim et al., Nature 2023). These analyses demonstrate the great potential of these data for future knowledge. The inclusion of multi-modal data, such as the blood datasets, which cover a diverse array of measurements (OSD-569, −570, −571, −575), also presents an exciting avenue for future exploration. This broader scope for analysis could unveil deeper connections between different biological responses and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the body’s adaptations to the space environment. Combining omics and medical assay data is the first step to understanding the biological significance of integrated findings. Translating them into actionable insights for space health will be our next step, which remains challenging but, for the first time, attainable. Looking ahead, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in the analysis of biomedical data from the I4 mission also holds great promise.

Copyright notice ID: 11094041 PMID: 38744887 Abstract The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology. Subject terms: Computational biology and bioinformatics, Biological techniquesIntroduction The increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceflight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)1–3 provides open and FAIR4 access to spaceflight and space-relevant biological studies from the past decades. Research enabled by OSDR data has revealed a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants to mammals (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html). Most prior research using OSDR data has focused on model organisms such as rodents, worms, and fruit flies. These valuable measurements provide insight into the response of neuromuscular, immune, and developmental biosystems to the stressors and hazards of spaceflight. Integrating human in vivo data takes these studies one step further and map previously characterized model organisms’ biological responses to the limited knowledge on human physiology in space. The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In the current special Nature package titled “The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,” a wide battery of analyses of these data have already provided valuable insights (Mason et al., Nature. 2023). The I4 mission stands as a significant milestone, amassing an extensive collection of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, thereby adding an invaluable series of datasets for deciphering the repercussions of spaceflight on human health. The open access of these datasets in the NASA OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, citizen scientists, researchers, and students to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. In this short article, we guide the readers on how to best conduct future analysis by presenting a series of vignettes illustrating pathways for accessing metadata and data from this rich resource through OSDR. We hope these guidelines will help the community contribute further to the vast compendium of findings already published from OSDR data and enable new hypotheses to be tested with both the human and model organism data. Compared to traditional model organisms used for research, one unique aspect of these data is the breadth of longitudinal measurements available from several human astronauts. Such temporal information for several individuals is unprecedented and pushes further the well-known “NASA’s Twin Study”5 where a single astronaut was monitored over 340 days on the international space station, referred to as a “N of 1” experiment. In contrast, even though the duration of the I4 mission was much shorter (3 days), it was at a higher altitude (590 km vs. 420 km), and since it featured four individuals monitored with such biological depth, the data opens the door to new and innovative follow-up studies (e.g. Polaris Dawn missions). Incorporating environmental data with microbiome data and a wide variety of phenotypic and high-throughput sequencing assays provides a rare opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessment of short-term and long-term spaceflight effects on humans. These datasets also provide a much-needed ability to compare human spaceflight effects to the previously characterized spaceflight consequences in model organisms. The analyses conducted thus far on the I4 mission’s data have already yielded substantial revelations, shedding light on the intricate interplay between space stressors and the immune system, cell-specific responses to spaceflight, rapid microbial interchange of the crew, and detailed maps of the changes in the skin from astronauts (Overbey et al., Nature 2023; Tierney et al., Nature Microbiology 2023; Kim et al., Nature 2023). These analyses demonstrate the great potential of these data for future knowledge. The inclusion of multi-modal data, such as the blood datasets, which cover a diverse array of measurements (OSD-569, −570, −571, −575), also presents an exciting avenue for future exploration. This broader scope for analysis could unveil deeper connections between different biological responses and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the body’s adaptations to the space environment. Combining omics and medical assay data is the first step to understanding the biological significance of integrated findings. Translating them into actionable insights for space health will be our next step, which remains challenging but, for the first time, attainable. Looking ahead, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in the analysis of biomedical data from the I4 mission also holds great promise. With all OSDR data accessible in a cloud-based public repository, standardized metadata, and a robust API query system, this effort demonstrates AI readiness and empowers our user community to explore beyond current findings. The sheer volume and complexity of the data call for advanced computational approaches that can uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden. Powerful techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, hold the potential to extract meaningful but complex insights from the vast dataset, facilitating the identification of subtle trends and potential health risks associated with space travel.

The protocol for controlled data access has been meticulously devised, drawing inspiration from established guidelines within the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) and incorporating best practices derived from the United Kingdom Biobank.

All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data records For illustration purposes, a single dataset will be used as an example for researcher access of I4 data from OSDR: OSD-572, which holds metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from crew skin samples collected to assess the response of microbial populations (skin, oral, nasal) to spaceflight. Samples were collected at three timepoints pre-flight (launch minus 92 days (L-92), L-44, and L-3), mid-flight for three time points (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and post-flight (return plus 1 day (R + 1), R + 45 R + 82). The OSDR study page (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-572) contains several sections with information about the study, including a description of the experiment that gave rise to the data, associated experiments, payloads, and missions, and a section detailing each experimental or analytical protocol involved in generating the dataset. A “publications” section also lists all published papers associated with this study. Figure 2 shows snapshots of the repository, emphasizing the metadata tables available for OSD-572. The Samples table (Fig. 2a) contains metadata information on each sample, including intrinsic characteristics of the sample (e.g., host organism, material type) as well as factor values relating to the experiment (e.g., spaceflight status, time collected). The Assays table contains metadata information for each sample pertaining to the assay specified in the drop-down menu (Fig. 2b). Users can choose a specific assay to display from the drop-down menu, and the assay table will update accordingly. Fig. 2. Sample and assay metadata available in OSDR for I4 study OSD-572. Open in a new tab a Sample metadata table contains sample level information regarding sample characteristics and experimental factors. b Assay metadata table contains information about each assay on a per sample level.Both metadata tables can be downloaded as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file with user-selected columns to aid downstream analyses. Sample names map across metadata and data fields to enable targeted selection of specific samples or differential analysis across groups. Figure 3 shows the raw and processed data files available to browse and download through the OSDR study page for OSD-630. All OSDR datasets use the ISA-Tab (Investigation, Study, Assay) metadata model6 to capture experimental metadata for each study. Under the “Study Metadata Files” folder, users can download the *ISA.zip file for the study, which contains the ISA-Tab files that hold all study information displayed on OSDR, to enable further characterization of the dataset (Fig. 3a). Investigator-submitted data, both raw and processed, can be found under “Metagenomics Data Files”. This folder houses raw FASTQ sequences, which are essentially the sequence files post-removal of human-read data (see Fig. 3b for visual representation). Fig. 3. Data available for browse and download in OSDR for I4 study OSD-630. Open in a new tab a Study metadata files include ISA-Tab files. b Investigator-deposited data files include the Metagenomics Data Files containing (human-read removed) raw FASTQ sequence data files and any investigator processed data files. c GeneLab Processed Metagenomics Files include a number of quality control outputs, including the FASTQC Outputs with a raw MultiQC report, and will contain GeneLab processed data files. d Examples of MultiQC data available for OSD-630.Furthermore, GeneLab, an integral component of the Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), has devised standardized omics data processing pipelines. These pipelines are instrumental in generating and disseminating processed data outputs for all omics datasets. They incorporate a rigorous quality control assessment process, including tools such as FastQC and MultiQC, particularly tailored for sequencing data analysis (refer to Fig. 3c, d for an illustrative depiction). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the OSDR encompasses a diverse array of physiological and phenotypic data types, spanning cytokine panels, complete blood counts, imaging data, ultrasonography records, and more. These data types are subject to stringent data and metadata standards, complemented by tabular data transformation protocols. This meticulous approach is designed to uphold data quality and foster data reuse. Importantly, these physio-phenotypic standards have been developed and reviewed in collaboration with subject matter experts who specialize in the respective assays, forming an integral part of the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWG).Usage notes These data, like any other datasets deposited into the OSDR repository, can be programmatically accessed through GLOpenAPI (https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/GLOpenAPI/). Here, we provide a quick example of running a differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment visualization in R (https://www.R-project.org/) using the unnormalized counts data associated with study OSD-569 (whole blood direct RNA-seq data). However, please note that unlike most other datasets, access to human RNA-Seq data requires authentication with sufficient credentials, which may be made available upon request. I.e. while normally one would simply use the read.csv() function, for these data, we will define a get.csv() function that passes the authentication token in the header of the request; we assume the token is stored in a variable called “TOKEN”: library(httr)get.csv = function (url, …) {auth = paste(\"Bearer\", TOKEN) response = GET(url, add_headers(Authorization=auth)) return(read.csv(text=content(response), …))} Metadata Since dataset OSD-569 is of interest, a query component “id=OSD-569” should be passed, and to retrieve all factor value metadata, a component “study.factor value” is added. Sample names and factors are columns in the metadata table. The header of the metadata table consists of two lines, and the first one may be skipped in many cases (see the GLOpenAPI manual for full explanation). The sample name is always the 3rd column (after “accession” and “assay name”), but, for illustrative purposes, here, we read everything as regular columns and assign row names manually in a later step. The request is sent to the GLOpenAPI “metadata” endpoint: GLOPENAPI = \"https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/GLOpenAPI/\"query = URLencode(\"id=OSD-569&study.factor value\")url = paste0(API, \"metadata/?\", query)metadata = get.csv(url, skip=1)cat(\"Metadata column names:\\n\")print(colnames(metadata)) Output: Metadata column names: [1] \"X.accession\" \"assay.name\" [3] \"sample.name\" \"subject\" [5] \"timestamp\"Data The same query component is included to retrieve data for OSD-569 (“id=OSD-569”). For differential expression analyses, data from files containing unnormalized RNA-Seq counts is requested (component “file.datatype=unnormalized counts”); the request is sent to the GLOpenAPI “data” endpoint. As it is common for differential expression analyses, sample names are column names in the data table, and gene names are row names. Gene names always come first, so we pass “row.names=1” to the get.csv() function. The header of the data table consists of three lines (accession, assay name, sample name), but as we are working with a single assay, we can skip the first two lines: q = \"id=OSD-569&file.datatype=unnormalized counts\"url = paste0(GLOPENAPI, \"data/?\", URLencode(q))data = get.csv( url, check.names=F, skip=2, row.names=1)Differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis At this point, the data is ready to be ingested into standard analysis tools, for example, DESeq27and fgsea8 with the use of MSigDb9 pathways. For DESeq2, sample names in the metadata should be represented as row names; and if, for example, we want to classify all timestamps into “preflight” (anything before launch, i.e. timestamps starting with “L-“), “postflight” (immediately after landing, “R+1”) and “recovery” (all other timestamps starting with “R+“), we also add a “status” column: rownames(metadata) = metadata$sample.namemetadata$status = sapply(metadata$timestamp, function (t) { ifelse(t==\"R+1\", \"postflight\", ifelse(startsWith(t, \"R+\"), \"recovery\", \"preflight\"))}) Finally, we run the analyses and visualize enrichment of a particular MSigDb pathway (DIAZ_CHRONIC_MYELOGENOUS_LEUKEMIA_UP) with result displayed in Fig. 4: Fig. 4. Enrichment analysis. Open in a new tab Enrichment of the DIAZ_CHRONIC_MYELOGENOUS_LEUKEMIA_UP MSigDb pathway in the RNA-Seq data associated with dataset OSD-569 at the postflight timestamp compared to preflight conditions, analyzed and visualized from data retrieved via GLOpenAPI.library(DESeq2)dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix( round(na.omit(data)), # DESeq2 requires integer values and absence of NaNs metadata, ~status+subject,) lrt = DESeq(dds, test=\"LRT\", reduced=~subject) deg = results(lrt, contrast=c(\"status\",\"postflight\", \"preflight\"))library(msigdbr) C2 = msigdbr(species=\"human\", category=\"C2\") pathways = split(x=C2$ensembl_gene, f=C2$gs_name) library(fgsea)deg$rank = deg$padj * sign(deg$log2FoldChange)ranks = with(na.omit(deg),setNames(rank, rownames(na.omit(deg))))plotEnrichment(pathways$DIAZ_CHRONIC_MYELOGENOUS_LEUKEMIA_UP, ranks)Technical validation The establishment of standardized data formats, uniform units of measurement, ontological frameworks, and comprehensive metadata fields is imperative to ensure the seamless integration of new data types into a repository and to enhance the capacity for cross-study biological analyses. Further, the integration of medical assays with multi-omics data, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other data modalities, facilitates meta-analyses geared towards better understanding of the human response to the space environment. The correlation between omics data and clinically significant endpoints derived from medical data holds paramount significance in elucidating health implications. Nonetheless, the integration of disparate data types remains a persistent challenge in the biomedical research domain, exacerbated by inconsistencies across laboratories and studies, as well as inherent variability in individual responses. Moreover, space missions like I4, which encompass multiple data collection points (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight, etc.), provide longitudinal datasets that enable the intricate yet potent exploration of space-induced responses over time. Over the five years, the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) were convened in order to ensure the reusability and standardization of data available within OSDR. These AWGs consist of diverse OSDR data stakeholders, including investigators, commercial entities, academic researchers, and students. Each AWG is dedicated to a distinct data category or domain of expertise, including animals, artificial intelligence, microbes, multi-omics, phenotypic data, and plants. Professionals within these AWGs contributed their expertise towards the formulation of standardized data processing pipelines and the development of assay metadata configurations tailored to each new data type. Consequently, OSDR was well-equipped to receive, curate, standardize, and process the wide spectrum of medical and omics data collected during the I4 mission. Medical data serves as a crucial resource for gaining insights into biological responses. However, balancing the imperative to protect sensitive health information of astronauts while enabling data sharing for research necessitates the robust implementation of privacy and security protocols. OSDR has introduced an innovative capability, allowing users to access metadata associated with private medical datasets, albeit without direct access to the data itself. OSDR’s dedication to comprehensive and unambiguous metadata, coupled with the utilization of the GLOpenAPI, underscores its readiness for analysis and artificial intelligence applications. The data query method illustrated here marks an initial step toward realizing the goal of Precision Space Health10,11. In cases where users seek to employ private medical datasets such as those collected on I4 for research purposes, an application process is in place that mandates approval from an institutional review board (IRB).Supplementary information Reporting Summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements OSDR is funded by the NASA Space Biology Program, part of the NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division within the NASA Science Mission Directorate; non-omics data are also partially supported by the NASA Human Research Program (HRP).

Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.

    "methods": "Methods Subjects and consent Four adult non-professional astronauts were selected to participate in the Inspiration4 mission. All subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which included the collection and use of their samples and data in research protocols at Weill Cornell Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine/TRISH and collaborating institutions; the study was approved by multiple IRBs and included the following IRB protocols: Weill Cornell Medicine IRB no. 21-05023569, WCG-IRB 1309934, Multimodal Evaluation of Spaceflight Participants Health – SpaceX Inspiration-4 Mission; Baylor College of Medicine/Translational Research Institute for Space Health IRB no. 1316696, WCG-IRB 20214456, Commercial Spaceflight Data Repository. Subjects consented to the storage of their de-identified, coded research data in a secure, password-protected database at SpaceX, Weill Cornell Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine/TRISH, and the institutions of study co-investigators. Subjects also consented to the publication of the results of this research while maintaining their confidentiality. Multi-omics methods Datasets generated for multi-omics profiling span nine different biospecimen sample types: whole blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), extracellular vesicles and particles, dried blood spots, skin biopsies, skin swabs and capsule swabs. These samples were subject to a spectrum of multi-omic assays, including WGS, clonal haematopoiesis, direct RNA sequencing, single-nuclei RNA sequencing, single-nuclei ATAC-seq, single-cell B cell repertoire and T cell repertoire V(D)J sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, cell-free DNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Additional biomarkers were quantified using a CLIA lab for complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and cytokine panel. These data types were generated across ten time points in total: three pre-flight (L − 92, L − 44, L − 3), three in-flight (FD1, FD2, FD3), one post-flight (R + 1) and three recovery (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194). Multi-omic feature counts describe the datasets published in refs. 4,5. Transcripts detected in whole blood RNA sequencing were assembled using StringTie52. m6A modifications were quantified using m6Anet53 with a probability threshold of 0.9. Genes detected from skin biopsy had a count of at least five from the normalized count matrix from the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. The number of ATAC-seq peaks and genes detected from the single-nuclei data was quantified using the cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) count algorithm from 10x Genomics. We followed the 10x single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported48 and adapted for this data as described here. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were deduplicated, filtered for human sequences via alignment to the human reference genome (Hg38) and trimmed for adaptor contamination. Fungal, viral and bacterial taxonomic composition was computed via masked read alignment to a database containing all complete genomes in RefSeq using kraken2 (confidence = 0.2)54. For assembly-based approaches, quality-controlled (unmasked) reads were assembled with MetaSPAdes55. Bins were generated with MetaBAT2 (ref. 56), and Open-Reading-Frames were identified with bakta57 and clustered into a non-redundant gene catalogue with mmseqs2 (ref. 58). Assembled viral genomes were identified among contigs with CheckV59. Additional details can be found in ref. 10. Virome methods Highly multiplexed, epitope-resolved IgG reactivity analysis across the human virome was performed on reconstituted dried blood samples using DNA-barcoded peptide (PepSeq) assays. The HV2 library has been previously described15 and consists of 15,000 30mer peptides covering 80 viral species and selected based on earlier evidence of reactivity in other cohorts. PepSeq libraries were synthesized and used to profile IgG binding, as previously described16,17. Briefly, DNA-barcoded peptide libraries were generated using bulk in vitro enzymatic reactions, starting with the PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates and their transcription to generate mRNA. The product was ligated to a hairpin oligonucleotide adaptor bearing a puromycin molecule tethered by a polyethylene glycol spacer and used as a template in an in vitro translation reaction. Finally, a reverse transcription reaction, primed by the adaptor hairpin, was used to generate cDNA, and the original mRNA was removed using RNAse. To perform serological assays, 0.1 pmol of the resulting DNA-barcoded peptide library (5 μl) was added to 5 μl of neat, reconstituted blood spot solution and incubated overnight. The binding reaction was applied to prewashed protein G-bearing beads, washed, eluted and indexed using barcoded DNA oligos. Following PCR cleanup, products were pooled, quantified and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument yielding a depth of more than 900,000 reads per sample. Z-score enrichment values for each peptide in each sample were generated from raw sequence reads in a two-step process using PepSIRF v.1.4.0, an open-source software package for the analysis of highly multiplexed serology60 data. First, reads were demultiplexed and mapped to members of the HV2 library using the demux module to generate integer count values for each sample peptide. Next, peptides with similar abundances in the buffer-only negative control samples were grouped into bins and used to generate z-scores for each data point, representing the distance (in standard deviations) of each data point from its unenriched distribution mean. log2-transformed offset-adjusted z-scores (log2(z + 8) − 3) were used for downstream analyses. At an adjusted z-score threshold of 0.75, we detected 45 virus species (Supplementary Table 3) for which at least 1 peptide was reactive in at least 1 sample. To identify viral events, we applied peptide set enrichment analysis to all pairs of consecutive samples as previously described19, and used a P value threshold of 1 × 10−5. Membrane printing 0g-VFI membranes were fabricated using nitrocellulose membrane sheets (9 × 8 cm), which were prepared into target membranes on a bench-top CO2 laser cutter at 1% power, 100% speed and 3 mm depth. These target membranes have circular discs (6 mm diameter) cut into them in a 6 × 5 design with fiducial markers for targeting the dispensing locations during microarray printing. Control antibody reagent (mouse IgG), rabbit anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and goat anti-human IgM (109-005-129, Jackson ImmunoResearch) capture antibodies were diluted to working concentrations (0.5 mg ml−1) using filtered 1× PBS. In a clean-room environment, a Nano-Plotter NP2.1 was used for non-contact piezoelectric microarray dispensing of capture antibodies onto the circular discs of a target nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm pore size). To prevent evaporation of reagents during printing, an ambient humidity of 55% was maintained using a humidifier. The nozzle hydrostatic pressure was set with the water level of the pressure compensation vessel at the pipette tip height. Spot-front-end software was utilized to co-ordinate a spotting plan for use in the Nano-Plotter Controller software (NPC16) to dispense a nine-spot pattern (350 µm period) of the antibody microarray onto the centre of each circular disc. A 384-well microplate was used to aspirate the antibodies during dispensing. The test reagents were dispensed in 20 droplets per spot at their respective working concentrations at the top two rows (three spots per row for each reagent) of the nine-spot pattern. Ten droplets of the control reagent were dispensed at the bottom three spots of the nine-spot pattern. The immunoassay membranes were then stored in aluminium pouches with silica bead desiccant for later use. Preparation of conjugation pad Conjugate pads were fabricated using polyester fibre with binder (Grade 6614, Ahlstrom Munksjo), which were cut into circular discs (10.5 mm) on a bench-top CO2 laser cutter. Gold nanoparticles conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (kindly provided by Dr AuCoin at the University of Nevada-Reno) were incubated with mouse anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and IgM (MA5-14729, ThermoFisher) for 10 min. The conjugate mix was then dispensed and dried on the conjugate pads at 25 °C for 2 h. Assembly of vertical flow apparatus The 0g-VFI consists of a stacked multilayer of pads and membranes assembled in 3D-printed plastic caps and capsules (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The sandwich immunoassay on the 0g-VFI is performed at the multiplexed sensing nitrocellulose membrane, which contains the nine immunoreaction spots. Above the 0g-VFI membrane are functional paper layers, which decrease flow surface area to achieve uniform vertical flow (flow-directing pad), decrease flow rate to increase intensity (retarding pad), generate the assay colour (conjugation pad) and collect plasma samples (sample pad). These layers are all contained in a 3D-printed pad holder, placed in a membrane housing that allows contact between the 0g-VFI membrane and cotton absorbing pads. The user-friendly device also contains capsules within which are wet pads (assay or washing buffer) that trigger fluid transfer once screwed to the membrane housing and placed in contact with the absorbing pads. In total, the 0g-VFI contains four modules consisting of the membrane housing protected with a cap, assay buffer capsule, washing buffer capsule and magnifier cap, all of which fit in small zip bags (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Overall, the assay takes up to 20 min due to its simple assembly sequence using the screw cap and reservoir design of the 0g-VFI platform (Extended Data Fig. 3c). A user manual and instruction video were made to detail the workflow procedure to SpaceX personnel and Inspiration4 crew. The user manual was integrated in the 0g-VFI kit and was thus available in-flight. The Inspiration4 crew were trained by SpaceX personnel and were instructed to work in pairs for sample collection and to self-perform the 0g-VFI procedure. All plastic components of the 0g-VFI were designed in SolidWorks and 3D-printed in house at the Center for Applied NanoBioscience and Medicine using a Surgical Guide Resin material from Formlabs. Using the Formlabs 3B stereolithography printer, the 0g-VFI was printed and then washed for 20 min in 99% isopropyl alcohol to clear loose and uncured resin. Curing was then performed under intense ultraviolet light at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by trimming of the support scaffolds. First, the different pad layers were stacked inside of the pad holder as follows (ordered top to bottom): sample pad (made from chopped glass with binder (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo)), polyethersulfone filter, conjugate pad, retarding and flow-directing pads both made of thin glass fibres (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo). All layers were assembled with double-sided, medical-grade pressure-sensitive adhesive (ARcare 90106NB). Second, a 3.5-cm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 320, Ahlstrom Munksjo) was positioned in the membrane housing with a 6-mm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 222, Ahlstrom Munksjo) on top, both acting as absorbent pads. The 0g-VFI printed membrane was then placed on top of the absorbing pads and 400 µl of blocking buffer (10 mM borate buffer (pH 8) with 2.5% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and 0.1% sucrose filtered through a 0.2 µm polyethersulfone filter membrane) was pipetted on it and incubated for 30 min. Then, the pad holder was positioned inside the housing membrane and the device was tightly closed with a lid. Separately, wet pads saturated with a TritonX100 (0.1%), albumin (0.5%), PBS (0.1 M) solution and a 50 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (washing buffer) were placed in the assay buffer pad capsule and the washing buffer pad capsule, respectively. Plasma was separated from fingerstick-collected whole blood using a modified A-PON plasma separator cartridge (GattaCo). As drawing blood using conventional methods is difficult in spaceflight for novice astronauts, whole blood was collected via fingerstick using a Food and Drug Administration-approved lancet to promote successful sample collection by the Inspiration4 crew. Ultrasound methods All imaging was performed with a Butterfly iQ+ handheld ultrasound system (Butterfly Network) with the Butterfly mobile app running on iPhone12 (Apple, Inc.). The device was used in approved preset modes for each procedure (ophthalmic, vascular and bladder). Eighty-nine imaging instances (multiframe cine of varied length) were collected pre-flight and 108 (7.68 GB) images were collected in-flight. All in-flight data (27 instances per astronaut on average; range = 18–32) were stored on the local device (iPhone 12) until secure transfer to a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) server upon return to Earth. Image analysis was performed in Osirix MD DICOM software (Pixmeo). Of the n = 106 in-flight imaging instances analysed, n = 73 were related to IJV, n = 14 to urinary bladder and n = 19 were ophthalmic. All astronauts were self-scanning operators. All pre-flight crew interactions (experiment briefing, familiarization and training, and baseline data collection) were conducted by SpaceX personnel using limited time allocations. Using a previously untested approach to experiment execution, the investigative team relied on experiment-specific JIT instructions to communicate both conceptual and procedural information to SpaceX personnel (for baseline data collection and familiarization) and to the Inspiration4 crew (for autonomous in-flight data collection). In-flight imaging data were obtained via self-scanning and used potable water as a coupling medium in lieu of ultrasound gel. Bladder scans were collected both pre- and post-void, whenever possible. IJV scans were performed with and without inspiratory resistance generated by an ITD (ResQGARD ITD7, Zoll). Given the risks to data quality posed by limitations of imaging expertise, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the JIT tools, a formalized data quality assessment was conducted in the initial phase of data analysis. This included the scoring of each imaging instance for anatomical accuracy and technical quality on a scale of 0–3 (0 = no useful information, 3 = clinical quality). Anatomical accuracy criteria included whether the target was clearly and contiguously visible, along with essential anatomical landmarks; technical quality criteria included elements such as image clarity, gain, acoustical interference, artefact and shadowing. An overall success score was derived as the mean of these two scores, with a usability threshold set at 2.0. This quality filter served to reject anatomically inaccurate or technically flawed images. To determine whether the success of imaging instances varied by anatomical target, a one-way ANOVA tested for in-flight differences in imaging success scores among anatomical targets (that is, bladder, IJV and eye); post hoc pairwise comparisons between anatomical targets were conducted via Tukey’s honest significant difference. To evaluate the effect of impedance breathing on IJV CSA, a series of paired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests were conducted; differences between normal and impedance breathing were evaluated by averaging IJV CSA for each condition within each mission phase (that is, pre-flight and in-flight). Ocular misalignment methods The otolith organs of the vestibular system transduce linear acceleration and gravity. The sense organs consist of a mass of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) that overlie a membrane that is innervated with hair cells. Motion of the crystals relative to the hair cells bends the hair cells, and this bending modifies their firing rates and so provides information on linear acceleration to the central vestibular system. While generally symmetric, there is reason to believe that there are slight asymmetries between the otolith organs on the two sides of the head, in otoconial mass or synaptic sensitivity. This asymmetry is compensated by central neural processes27, but this compensation becomes inappropriate in gravity fields other than 1g, leading to changes in vertical and torsional ocular alignment61,62. In particular, the magnitude of torsional misalignment in altered g levels has been associated with susceptibility to SMS40,41,63. G-dependent changes in vertical alignment have also been demonstrated in parabolic flight and laboratory studies62,64. Data on SMS in-flight were obtained via self-report. A perceptual-nulling technique was used to measure misalignment between the eyes (skew) in both vertical and torsional directions65. For these tests, the subject views a red line and a blue line on the touchscreen of a tablet computer, through colour-matched red and blue filters, one over each eye. This provides independent images to each eye. Since the test is performed in darkness, there is no visual information that is seen by both eyes together, and hence there are no visual cues to align the eyes (which would fuse the images on the two retinas). One line remains fixed on the screen, while the other line is positioned by the subject, either vertically or torsionally. The subject’s goal is to adjust one line until it appears to be aligned with the other, stationary, line (that is, to null any apparent vertical or rotational offset between the lines). The final amount by which the lines are separated from one another vertically or rotated relative to one another provides a measure of vertical or torsional ocular misalignment, respectively, which produces measures of VAN and TAN. Astronauts completed VAN and TAN measures twice pre-flight and twice post-flight, where each session consisted of 11 VAN and 11 TAN trials. There was no in-flight testing. Statistical testing to evaluate associations of torsional (TAN) and vertical (VAN) ocular misalignment with SMS were carried out via a series of two-sample t-tests within each astronaut individually to provide information on the following: (1) whether the two pre-flight datasets are the same or different from each other, (2) whether the two post-flight datasets are the same or different from each other and (3) whether the (grouped) pre-flight data are different from the (grouped) post-flight data. The t-tests were performed after removing outliers, which were defined as values more than three scaled median absolute deviations from the median, where median absolute deviation is a measure of the deviation of the values from the median (analogous to the standard deviation for data from normal distributions) and can be reduced to a sequential decision tree for prediction of individual SMS susceptibility (Supplementary Note 2). There are several reasons for this individual testing as opposed to a pooled analysis across subjects. First, the high variability across subjects (typical of many neurovestibular assessments), combined with the small subject pool, makes it unlikely that there would be sufficient statistical power in a pooled analysis. Second, individual testing permits a stepwise approach in which a series of tests can lead to a predictive metric. Finally, SMS is notoriously idiosyncratic, and spaceflight measures are subject to many confounds, which supports a focused longitudinal examination. Cardiovascular function The Apple Watch Series 6 was used to objectively measure cardiovascular function, which was indexed by blood oxygen saturation levels, heart rate and HRV, as well as activity and energy consumption. The Apple Watch also measured sound pressure levels. The crew donned the Apple Watch for selected periods in all three phases of the mission, including pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight (Extended Data Fig. 1). The crew donned the Apple Watch from L − 22 to L − 20 and had an average wear time of 2.7 ± 0.3 (s.d.) days (range = 2.4–3.0 days), in-flight from FD2 to FD3 with an average wear time of 1.2 ± 0.1 (s.d.) days (range = 1.2–1.4 days) and post-flight from R + 0 to R + 10 with an average wear time of 5.8 ± 3.4 (s.d.) days (range = 2.2–9.1 days). Neurocognitive functioning Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using NASA’s cognition test battery33, which consists of 10 brief cognitive tests that probe a range of neurocognitive domains relevant to the challenges of spaceflight and includes the psychomotor vigilance test, matrix reasoning test, abstract matching, line orientation test, visual object learning test, motor praxis task, emotion recognition task, digit–symbol substitution task, fractal 2-back and balloon analogue risk test. Developed for high-performing astronauts, cognition has been deployed in long-duration spaceflight studies1, as well as in ground-based studies that simulate aspects of spaceflight in analogue environments66–68. Cognition was administered with the Joggle Research App (Pulsar Informatics, Inc.) on an iPad Mini Series 4 twice pre-flight (L − 47 and L − 22), up to three times in-flight and twice post-flight (R + 0 and R + 1). Cognition data were corrected for practice and stimulus set effects after applying another correction for the fact that tests were performed on an iPad instead of a laptop69,70. After these corrections, the expectation is that test results do not change with repeated administration. Alertness and mood survey Before performing each cognition test battery, astronauts reported on their behavioural state using the AMS50 via the Qualtrics application on the Apple iPad Mini Series 4. Developed for astronauts, the 18-item AMS measures behavioural responses to the challenges of both long- and short-duration spaceflight. Fourteen of the 18 AMS items were surveyed in the Inspiration4 crew to reduce time burden, and the four items that were removed had significant overlap with other AMS items. Ten AMS items (monotony, boredom, depression, stress, physical exhaustion, sickness, unhappiness, sleepiness, workload and sleep quality) prompted astronauts to rate each item using 11-point Likert scales (range = 0–10). The remaining AMS items assessed astronaut sleep timing and duration, crew conflict and medication use (stimulant/depressant). Statistical analysis of cognition, AMS and Apple watch data All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4. Before statistical analysis of cognitive performance, all cognition data were standardized via z-scoring to facilitate comparisons across the different neurocognitive domains, as well as to allow the effects to be interpreted as effect sizes. Mixed-effects models using PROC MIXED with a random subject intercept were used to test astronaut behavioural and physiological responses to short-duration spaceflight across mission phases. Repeated measures were nested within subjects and differences between responses during both the in-flight and post-flight periods were tested relative to the pre-flight period using change scores generated for each astronaut from the average of an outcome for each mission phase. Post hoc analyses that tested differences between astronauts and mission phases were corrected for multiple comparisons based on the false discovery rate method with a significance threshold of P < 0.05 (refs. 51); both unadjusted and adjusted P values are reported. For crew-level differences between mission phases, Type III effects are reported.

    "discussion": "Discussion To understand the effects of short-duration spaceflight on the human body for the all-civilian spaceflight crew, this study performed a suite of experiments and collected a wide range of biospecimens before, during and after a 3-day orbital mission. This multidimensional battery included blood, stool, urine, biopsy and saliva samples, ultrasound measurements of the eye, jugular vein and bladder, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys and physiological data collected with an Apple smartwatch. These data showed some of the same signatures of long-duration spaceflight, such as inflammatory response, DNA damage response gene expression (and proteins), telomere elongation and immune signalling changes (Figs. 1 and 2), and demonstrated that such phenotypes can also be observed in the earliest phases of spaceflight and across a shorter mission time frame. Moreover, this mission also enabled new biomedical metrics for spaceflight, such as RNA methylation, single-nucleus chromatin, single-cell expression metrics and spatial transcriptomics. Overall, this work demonstrated that a diverse civilian crew can conduct scientific experiments, process samples and significantly contribute to spaceflight research with minimal risk. Although two astronauts presented with SMS, most metrics (for example, IJV size, heart rate, complete blood count metrics, gene expression and cytokines) were either stable or quickly reverted to pre-flight levels (baseline) after landing on Earth. The development of diagnostic, point-of-care devices that can detect and quantify multiple biomarkers is critical to monitor astronauts’ healthcare for future spaceflight missions and to help guide medical interventions. This mission showed that a VFI can be used to detect antigens and, more generally, protein markers37–39. Due to flight certification constraints required for all technologies used in spaceflight, the desiccant usually placed in the packaging kit to avoid high humidity exposure during long-term storage had to be removed, and has been identified as the main cause for the alteration of the assay efficiency in-flight. For future missions, reagent and system stability studies will have to determine optimal storage conditions without the use of hygroscopic compounds. Despite this obstacle, the 0g-VFI demonstrated its robustness of operation in space, and the simplicity of its user interface allowed for its use by untrained non-scientists, supporting the feasibility of such point-of-care diagnostic systems for several applications on additional specimen types, including for deep-space missions. The Inspiration4 ultrasound imaging experiment pursued three research objectives, which were to examine (1) urinary bladder function in microgravity, (2) IJV flow with and without intervention by inspiratory resistance and (3) microgravity-associated changes in ocular morphology. The choice of targets was motivated by high-priority concerns and risks reported over the years of ISS missions. For example, flow anomalies in the IJV (for example, severe stasis, flow reversal) frequently develop in ISS crew members in the later stages of long-duration spaceflight20–22; however, such alterations in cardiovascular function have been less studied in the earlier days of spaceflight when precursors to cardiovascular risks may begin to emerge23. In the Inspiration4 mission, IJV flow anomalies were not observed in any of the four astronauts, suggesting that flow anomalies develop later in-flight. The lack of IJV flow anomalies also diverge from Earth-based simulations of microgravity (head-down tilt), which demonstrate IJV and other vascular alterations after five days of exposure23. If corroborated by future studies in short-duration spaceflight, this finding may further our understanding of the mechanisms and progression pattern of flow degradation in the left IJV during sustained microgravity. Inspiratory resistance reduced right IJV CSA by an average of 36% pre-flight (supine) and 29% in-flight but did not reach statistical significance in this small cohort of astronauts. This trend suggests facilitated IJV drainage due to resistance breathing, and the experiment demonstrated a simplified in-flight screening method, with resistance breathing as an option to correct anomalous IJV flow. Overall, these findings bode well for the cardiovascular safety profile of short-duration missions, although future studies that address other anatomical targets are needed, as the effects of spaceflight are not uniform throughout the cardiovascular system23,24. A better understanding of the cardiovascular risks could alleviate some of the spaceflight health concerns for private citizens with diverse health backgrounds and medical histories, although notably, no health issues were observed in the Inspiration4 crew. The Inspiration4 mission undertook ultrasound imaging-based human research in full crew autonomy, with minimal pre-flight familiarization and reliance on experiment-specific just-in-time (JIT) instruction. Probing the potential limitations of miniaturized ultrasound technology combined with the rapid deployment and complete crew autonomy was an inseparable part of the experiment. This autonomy is in stark contrast to the ISS experience, where all imaging sessions are conducted with a traditional device and in real-time interaction with experts in the mission control centre. The anatomical and technical quality of the images, expressed as overall success scores, appeared inversely related to the complexity of the autonomous procedures. Bladder imaging (the simplest procedure) and IJV imaging (intermediate difficulty and complexity) each had similar scores, well above the usability threshold. Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. In this study, all but the most intricate procedures could be successfully performed by minimally trained users with the aid of appropriate JIT materials. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). Payloads consisting of a miniaturized imaging system with an intuitive interface can enable future experiments featuring short lead and training times, rapid deployment, flexible schedules and data collection autonomy, which will enable scientific research opportunities even on the most constrained of spaceflight missions. Studying ocular misalignment and otolith symmetry in short-duration spaceflight is not without caveats. First, the Inspiration4 results (Fig. 4) are based on comparing pre-flight and post-flight tests and relating that comparison to in-flight SMS. The ultimate goal is to use pre-flight tests alone to predict in-flight susceptibility, which is planned for future flights. The incidence of SMS was 50% in the Inspiration4 mission, which is consistent with the reported incidence in short-duration spaceflight29. Second, there is no relation between motion sickness susceptibility in parabolic flight and susceptibility in orbital flight, yet early work on torsional alignment was performed in parabolic flight to predict susceptibility in orbital flight40. Third, our results with VAN are promising for SMS prediction, while results with TAN are not (of note, the original work41 relating SMS to ocular skew was done with torsion). Finally, SMS has multiple contributing factors and multiple manifestations that vary between individuals, and thus it may be unrealistic to think that a single measure will continue to have high predictive power in a larger population. Consistent with studies of astronauts and cosmonauts completing both short- and long-duration spaceflight missions34–36, collecting objective measures of astronaut cardiovascular functions and neurocognitive functioning, as well as subjective measures of sleep and astronaut behavioural states, is feasible in commercial astronaut crews throughout short-duration orbital missions. The Inspiration4 crew provided valid and usable data on cardiovascular physiology, cognitive performance and behavioural states across mission phases that can translate to the general public3,42, which is important as trained astronauts from international space agencies are not necessarily representative of the average individual. The effects of short-duration spaceflight on Inspiration4 crew cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance were modest, although there was substantial interindividual variability in the response to spaceflight, as previously observed34,43,44. Studies of cognitive performance have generally found that astronauts maintain relatively high levels of performance in spaceflight, although this may be a function of the duration of spaceflight missions, where performance decrements manifest with longer mission durations1,34. In this study, accuracy on eight of the ten (80%) cognition tests was unaffected by short-duration spaceflight (Fig. 5). There was, however, more variability in astronaut response speed on neurocognitive tasks, where slower response speeds were observed on four cognition tests, a finding consistent with earlier reports of astronaut response slowing during short-duration spaceflight (that is, less than or equal to 10 days in spaceflight shuttle missions)45,46. Although previous studies have not found large cognitive performance deficits in spaceflight, this may be due to the timing of neurocognitive testing, which often does not occur on the first day in-flight, but up to four days in-flight, at which point cognitive deficits may have dissipated. Furthermore, the observed changes in response speed may, to some extent, be associated with neurovestibular and sensorimotor alterations induced by spaceflight26,47. While astronaut sleep durations less than 6 h on the ISS have been associated with psychomotor slowing, Inspiration4 astronauts averaged 6.7 h of sleep per night in-flight and thus the contribution of sleep loss to slower response speeds would be modest if present36. Astronauts did not report overtly negative behavioural states in-flight (for example, depression, stress), but they reported more happiness and less boredom post-flight relative to pre-flight (Fig. 5). Significantly, all data from this study are stored in multiple controlled-access repositories for easy access, including TrialX, NASA’s Open Science Data Repository and GeneLab, the SOMA data portal and the Commercial Spaceflight Data Repository, which facilitates the collection of mission-specific research, medical data and biospecimens to be stored in a permanent electronic data and tissue repository for future scientific research. These data also include qualitative survey data received via mobile apps, DICOM-standard images from portable ultrasound devices, data from wearables (for example, heart rate, electrocardiogram), biospecimen information, cell processing details48 and the environmental/mission data from the Crew Dragon capsule (for example, cabin pressure, temperature and humidity, spacecraft telemetry), which can help guide exploration-class future missions49. Finally, the repository contains a visualization dashboard for researchers to view summary analytics and access individual observations and data files, which has been added to TRISH’s enhancing exploration platforms and analogue definition programme. Although the Inspiration4 mission was the first all-civilian crew to complete a short-duration, orbital spaceflight mission while collecting repeated multidimensional measurements of biological and behavioural function relevant to the challenges of spaceflight, the study is not without limitations. Although the total sample of n = 4 astronauts is small, it is not inconsistent with previous studies of astronaut cognitive performance in spaceflight. While data collection spaceflight is challenging and limited by numerous factors (for example, cost, limited time and access to astronauts), longitudinal sampling of measures within and across mission phases can promote statistical power (Supplementary Note 1). This study did not have age- and sex-matched controls on Earth; however, repeated measures within the Inspiration4 crew across mission phases allow for astronauts to serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight (that is, baseline) levels as a reference. Future studies, or additional studies with equivalent design, of civilian astronauts in short-duration spaceflight with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the findings or to assign any possible causal links. Finally, it is worth noting that the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to address how the biological and behavioural responses of the Inspiration4 crew relate to those of professional astronauts or cosmonauts, or those with career-long exposure to spaceflight. Furthermore, the research on the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, or to recommend spaceflight for future civilian passengers; the Inspiration4 research projects were also not tasked with making judgements for future crew selection or fitness for spaceflight. The selection of astronauts for spaceflight is exclusive to international space agencies (governmental or commercial). Nonetheless, the Inspiration4 data, along with data from other civilian spaceflight missions, may contribute to the development of reference ranges and pre-flight preparatory tasks (for example, behavioural testing in confined environments) that can help guide future crew selection and mission planning.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions While broad in its research scope, this study represents only the beginning. Anatomical and physiological variability, small sample size, the operational complexities of a highly constrained mission and limited skill management capabilities combined to preclude confident conclusions on many physiological variables. However, as intended by the TRISH, enhancing exploration platforms and analog definition, and SOMA programmes, these Inspiration4 data will serve as a rich foundation for scaling and enhancing the knowledge base on early phases of space physiology, and expanding our understanding of spaceflight-associated effects on human health. Future missions can also include telemedicine, more autonomous data collection, next-generation sequencing-based in-flight omics assays and related diagnostics tools. Excitingly, some of these same astronauts will be present on future missions and/or contribute to long-term studies of astronaut health, which will help delineate the short- and long-term impacts of spaceflight and continue to prepare future astronauts for their missions. Finally, it is worth noting that collaboration with government, academia and the private sector at the same time led to lessons learned that should be useful to investigators embarking on similar endeavours in future civilian spaceflight missions. Specifically, co-ordination among diverse research teams can be enabled by agile funding entities (for example, TRISH, SpaceX, philanthropy) and a dedicated project manager. Also, a single institutional review board (IRB) protocol, such as that put in place by TRISH, can simplify subject consenting, while a standardized database provider (TrialX, funded by TRISH) was critical for data ingestion, cross-institute sharing and standardization for future cross-mission analyses and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Finally, the consent and release forms of study participants were envisioned for long-term use, with datasets managed under the oversight of a data release board, and for these precious samples to be utilized and characterized for many years to come.",

Copyright notice ID: 11357997 PMID: 38862026 Abstract Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such as in the NASA Twins Study1, but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions. Subject terms: Physiology, Molecular biology, Cognitive neuroscience, Oculomotor system, Visual system SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission sent an all-civilian crew into orbit to study physiological, neurovestibular and neurocognitive changes in the astronauts and found that short-duration civilian space missions do not pose a major health risk.Main Orbital human spaceflight missions have historically flown highly screened and extensively trained cohorts of astronauts, with limited public data available for follow-up analyses. However, with the emergence of private space programmes and broadening access to orbital missions, new opportunities for research and discovery have emerged for civilian engagement with spaceflight. Specifically, SpaceX has now launched or announced several privately supported missions, including the all-civilian Inspiration4 mission and the Polaris Dawn series of missions (including on Starship). These missions enable a broader representation of astronaut cohorts, spanning a wider range of ages (for example, the youngest American astronaut, Hayley Arceneaux), balanced representation of sexes, diverse genetic and medical backgrounds, as well as opportunities for new science, technology, art and public engagement during their missions. Here we present findings from the human research experiments performed on SpaceX’s first all-civilian private spaceflight, Inspiration4, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on 15 September 2021, on the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. This orbital class mission reached 590.6 km in altitude; the farthest distance crewed orbital missions have been into space since the Gemini programme. Although the crew spent only 3 days in low Earth orbit, they experienced similar hazards of spaceflight as International Space Station (ISS) missions (often 6–12 months in duration), including radiation exposure, sustained microgravity, the closed and hostile environment of space, isolation and confinement, and long distance from Earth resources2. Thus, the Inspiration4 mission, and similar missions, provide a platform to study these acute exposures endemic to low Earth orbit, with unique data collection opportunities in the earliest phase of the human body’s response to spaceflight. The three main objectives of the research projects deployed on the Inspiration4 mission were to (1) evaluate the feasibility of collecting biological and behavioural data in an all-civilian crew throughout pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight phases of the spaceflight mission, (2) examine the biological and behavioural responses of the crew to short-duration orbital spaceflight and (3) build the foundation for a biomedical database and enable access to these biomedical data from the crew and mission. The Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of medical research aboard a commercial spaceflight mission crewed by non-professional astronauts, as well as new clinical and research protocols, which spanned a wide range of assays and experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Specifically, the Multimodal Evaluation of Spaceflight Health protocol for the Inspiration4 mission from the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) funded multiple investigators to conduct separate yet related investigations on the Inspiration4 mission, and deployed a battery of tests to understand some of the major effects of short-duration spaceflight on humans, including portable ultrasound measurements, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys, physiological data collected with a smartwatch and blood/saliva testing. Moreover, a comprehensive Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) protocol, based on the NASA Twins Study1, was used to measure multi-omic, clinical and immune profiles in whole blood, serum, plasma, saliva and biopsied skin samples. In this Article, we present and discuss the key findings from studies evaluating the Inspiration4 crew’s comprehensive multi-omics analyses of biospecimens, ultrasound imaging, otolith function, cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance, which together enable an in-depth biomedical research approach for private crews on upcoming missions and unprecedented access to these data and samples. Extended Data Fig. 1. The environmental, physiological, cognitive, imaging, and omics measures collected across Inspiration4 mission phases and their sampling frequency. Open in a new tab To assess the effect of short-duration spaceflight on an all-civilian crew, data were collected on myriad domains using various methodologies (colors, left) before, during, and after flight spanning human biometrics, virome, cognition, spacecraft environment, and multi-omics assays. Green circles denote samples collected on Earth (i.e., pre-flight, post-flight) and blue diamonds denote data collected in-flight, along with their respective assays. For the timing of data collection, data collected during the pre-flight period is presented as the number of days prior to launch (L) and data collected in the post-flight period is presented as the number of days following return (R) to Earth. Data with continual collection (e.g. cabin measurements) are shown as bracketed time periods.Multi-omic profiling of the Inspiration4 crew Building upon established omics, sample pipelines and analytic methods from the NASA Twins Study1, we collected samples for an integrative multi-omics analysis of the Inspiration4 crew (Extended Data Fig. 2). This included biospecimens collected before launch (L) pre-flight (L − 92, L − 44 and L − 3), in-flight (flight days (FDs) FD1, FD2 and FD3) and post-flight following return (R) to Earth (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82 and R + 194). Blood, saliva, skin swabs, skin biopsies and capsule swabs were collected (Extended Data Fig. 2), followed by a battery of assays to collect multi-omic measurements, including spatially resolved transcriptomics, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), direct RNA sequencing, combined single-nuclei RNA sequencing/single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), T cell receptor immune repertoire sequencing, B cell receptor immune repertoire sequencing, proteomics (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)), metabolomics (LC–MS/MS), a clonal haematopoiesis panel, cell-free DNA and cell-free RNA sequencing from plasma, shotgun metagenomics and shotgun metatranscriptomics (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2). Also, clinical measurements were obtained and included complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a CLIA-grade (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) WGS and pharmacogenomics profile, a cardiovascular biomarker panel and cytokine/chemokine panel assays (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Extended Data Fig. 2. SOMA biosample collections during the Inspiration4 mission. Open in a new tab Sample types and downstream assays performed for multi-omic and clinical biomarkers. A variety of blood derivatives were collected via venipuncture. Samples that have not yet been sequenced are biobanked. EVP = extracellular vesicles and particles. Env = environment. Created with BioRender.com.Fig. 1. Multi-omic changes across the Inspiration4 mission. Open in a new tab Hundreds of thousands of multi-omic measurements were generated across multiple sample types. From DNA, single-nuclei chromatin accessibility, WGS, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing, telomere length and clonal haematopoiesis were measured. From RNA, whole blood gene expression, whole blood m6A modifications, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) single-nuclei RNA sequencing, skin spatially resolved gene expression and T cell and B cell immune repertoire profiling were performed. For proteins, plasma proteomics, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVP) proteomics and plasma metabolomics were quantified. Additionally, from microbial skin and environmental (Env.) swabs, bacterial, fungal and viral species were measured.These data revealed a broad set of molecular changes across multiple layers of biology (Fig. 1), and each specific omics dataset was examined in depth across several Inspiration4 companion papers. First, epigenetics data from single-nuclei chromatin (single-nuclei ATAC-seq) profiling showed more than 70,000 peaks per sample, which were enriched for genes involved in DNA repair, immune activation and nucleosome organization4,5, notably matching results from the NASA Twins Study1. Second, telomere elongation was observed for all crew members, but all other metrics of genome stability, sequence divergence and clonal haematopoiesis were unchanged6. Third, we observed an average of 668 metabolites and more than 4,000 proteins per sample in plasma, which was smaller than the 637 proteins per sample in the exosome population, yet the exosome proteomic data revealed unique, brain-associated peptides7. Fourth, direct RNA nanopore sequencing showed a mean of 13,022 transcripts per sample, plus a significant spike in methyl-6-adenine (m6A) levels on the day of landing, R + 1 (ref. 8); this was complemented with a range of 18,632–29,900 genes detected across all single-nucleus RNA sequencing data. Fifth, we characterized the spatial biopsies of the crew samples with GeoMx, which revealed a mean of 16,433 genes per section, with evidence of disrupted inflammation in pathways near the surface of the skin9. Finally, we examined the microbiome of the crew, using shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics before, during and after spaceflight, and we found a spike in virus abundance in-flight, as well as 3.6 million non-redundant genes at 90% identity, 1,287 metagenomic assembled genomes and 1,544 assembled viral genomes10.Immune reactivity analysis The primary objective of the virome-wide antibody project was to assess immunological responses, including those that could be associated with viral reactivation, during short-duration spaceflight, as a multitude of evidence has demonstrated perturbation of the immune system (for example, decreased cellular immunity, dysregulation of T cell function and cytokine production) and reactivation of latent viruses during both short-duration (for example, space shuttle) and long-duration ISS missions11–14. Therefore, we generated virome reactivity profiles of the Inspiration4 crew across mission phases, leveraging a highly multiplexed assay (‘PepSeq’) that measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity to peptides representing the human virome15–17. PepSeq analysis using a previously described15 15,000-peptide assay covering 80 human-infecting viral species showed that the reactivity profiles of dried blood spot samples collected in-flight clustered with those of terrestrial samples from the corresponding astronauts (Fig. 2a), indicating that the collection and storage of samples during flight did not adversely affect their quality. The time-invariant reactivity profiles of the four astronauts included reactivity to 45 species (Supplementary Table 3) and were dominated by reactivity to peptides from respiratory viruses and Epstein–Barr virus13,18, as expected (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2. Virome-wide antibody analysis of blood samples self-collected during short-duration spaceflight. Open in a new tab Blood spot samples were collected longitudinally across all mission phases from the four Inspiration4 astronauts and analysed for IgG reactivity across a 15,000-plex peptide library representing 80 human-infecting viral species using the PepSeq assay. a, Reactivity for each sample (columns) is shown across all 1,490 peptides (rows) reactive in at least one astronaut, with samples clustered by the similarity of their reactivity profiles and peptides grouped by the virus species from which they were designed. Sample reactivity profiles clustered tightly within each astronaut, including those collected in-flight. Reactivity was detected against peptides from a total of 45 virus species, listed in Supplemental Table 3, including full names. b, Time intervals with significantly increasing (red) or decreasing (blue) IgG reactivity in the four astronauts, detected using Peptide Set Enrichment Analysis19 (Methods). Shown are the four virus species for which at least one significant increase was detected with the six sampling time points indicated by vertical tick marks at the top of the plot. EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; EV-A, Enterovirus A; EV-B, Enterovirus B; EV-C, Enterovirus C; EV-D, Enterovirus D; HAdV-B, Human mastadenovirus B; HAdV-C, Human mastadenovirus C; HAdV-D, Human mastadenovirus D; HHV-1, Human alphaherpesvirus 1; HHV-4, Human gammaherpesvirus 4; HHV-5, Human betaherpesvirus 5; HHV-6, Human betaherpesvirus 6; HHV-7, Human betaherpesvirus 7; HOPV, Human orthopneumovirus; HRV3, Human respirovirus 3; HRV-A, Rhinovirus A; HRV-B, Rhinovirus B; HRV-C, Rhinovirus C; NV, Norwalk virus; RV-A, Rotavirus; SARS-CoV-2, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.To detect species-specific antibody changes during the sampling period, we conducted a peptide set enrichment analysis19 to compare all pairs of consecutive time points for each virus species (Fig. 2b). We detected a total of n = 8 such events (defined as significant reactivity increases); the largest number corresponded to Epstein–Barr virus (n = 4), a virus previously reported to be reactive in astronauts during short-duration spaceflight13,18. The remainder were species associated with common upper respiratory infections: Rhinoviruses A and C (n = 2 and n = 1, respectively) and Adenovirus C (n = 1). The Epstein–Barr virus events included changing reactivity that overlapped with flight for astronauts C001 and C002 during flight (Fig. 2b), although these specific viruses were not found in the sequence data (Fig. 1). These combined analyses indicate that changing immunity to viruses can be detected during spaceflight, even under conditions where no viral symptoms or replication are detected, which has been previously documented in astronauts during longer missions14.Point-of-care sampling and analysis In addition to the viral and immune profiles, the Inspiration4 crew also tested a paper-based multiplexed microgravity-adapted vertical flow immunoassay (0g-VFI) (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c) to detect plasma immunoglobulin M (IgM) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in-flight via gold nanoparticle-conjugated antibodies. Assessment of cross-reactivity and specificity showed no significant non-specific binding, with a minimal background sometimes visible for IgM (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The limit of detection for CRP and IgM was 0.01 and 0.7 µg ml−1, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 20% (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and the presence of some high-level outliers was the result of a low spatial distribution homogeneity that was compensated by measurement repeatability (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Post-flight examination of the 0g-VFI showed that absorbing pads displayed a marked area, suggesting that an average of 80 µl of fluid crossed the membrane, thus highlighting both that fluid displacement occurred in the microgravity environment and that it was correctly used by the Inspiration4 crew (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Finally, the analysis of 0g-VFI membranes showed that no IgM or CRP were detected for the devices run in space following standard protocol (15 min incubation) by the crew (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Unused kits stored in the Dragon capsule were run post-flight on Earth and did not display any changes either. Furthermore, control kits stored on Earth with hygroscopic compounds for the same period (that is, the duration of the flight experiment) and run for 15 min also showed strong intensity, suggesting the need to maintain low humidity levels during storage. Accelerated stability studies conducted in an environmental chamber at 42 °C and 75% humidity confirmed the effect of desiccation on VFI performance, with a more than 8-fold decrease in intensity after storage without a hygroscopic compound (Extended Data Fig. 5).

For each CRP and IgM plot, a four-parameter logistic model was used to generate the fitted curve and the limit of detection (LOD), represented as a dotted line, was determined using the following formula: LOD=x¯negC+3σnegC, where LOD is equal to the mean of the negative control (negC) + 3 standard deviations (σ) of the negative control. b, Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) across CRP and IgM assays are presented; CVs were calculated by CV (%) = (Standard Deviation/Mean) x 100.

The Inspiration4 mission featured the first in-flight research use of Butterfly iQ+, a handheld single-probe ultrasound device for urinary bladder, internal jugular vein (IJV) and eye imaging in full crew autonomy (Fig. 3). Aims for all targets included both the assessment of physiological changes in response to spaceflight and evaluation of autonomous procedure efficacy. Eighty-nine imaging instances (multiframe cine of varied length) were collected pre-flight, and 108 imaging instances were collected in-flight, yielding an average of 27 instances per astronaut (range = 18–32 instances). Bladder imaging success scores were above the usability threshold (2.33 ± 0.24 (s.d.); range = 2.0–2.5; Methods), demonstrating the effectiveness of the imaging system and the instructions for urinary bladder volume assessments (Fig. 3b). However, these image sets did not reveal significant physiological trends, possibly due to variability between the small number of astronauts and crew-reported operational constraints affecting the timing of data acquisition relative to voiding. The bilateral IJV images were the highest in quality (2.36 ± 0.51 (s.d.); range = 1.8–2.9) and thus amenable to quantification and analysis. The in-flight image sets from ocular imaging (the most intricate procedure) consistently scored below the usability threshold in all four astronauts (0.76 ± 0.51 (s.d.; range = 0.0–1.1); the mean ocular success score was lower than both the bladder and IJV success scores, which were of similar quality. Therefore, ocular imaging data were deemed inadequate for quantification of microgravity-induced structural changes. Fig. 3. Imaging-based experiments. Open in a new tab a, Payload: Butterfly iQ+ ultrasound system and ResQGARD ITD7 used for physiological intervention. b, Summary plot of image quality assessment. For each image acquired, imaging success scores were calculated based on anatomical accuracy and technical quality (Methods). The mean success score for each astronaut is plotted as an individual data point, and grey-dotted bars represent the grand mean ± s.d. of astronaut success scores for each anatomical target; n = 4 astronauts, n = 14 bladder images, n = 73 IJV images and n = 19 eye images.

Pre-flight data were derived from a single imaging instance per astronaut, while in-flight data were averaged across in-flight instances within each astronaut (range = 1–3 imaging instances); mean IJV CSA for each astronaut is presented for each condition, along with the grand mean ± s.d. The difference between grand means for each IJV CSA assessment pre-flight (GND) and in-flight (FLT) is visualized with a black dashed linear trend line; n = 4 astronauts, n = 4 GND images, n = 4 GND ITD images, n = 8 FLT images and n = 7 FLT ITD images. No differences between pre-flight (GND) and in-flight (FLT) were found evaluated using paired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests with a significance threshold of α < 0.05.The IJV imaging protocol was similar to the protocol described in ref. 20, which was designed to measure bilateral IJV cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and flow velocities, and can be used to identify anomalies, such as thrombi, loss of flow spontaneity, flow reversal and spontaneous echo contrast development21,22 (Fig. 3c). In contrast to long-duration ISS cohorts20,22 and regardless of flight day (FD1–3), both IJVs were free from thrombi and flow anomalies in all Inspiration4 astronauts. Spontaneous antegrade flow was demonstrated in all examined IJVs by colour and (or) spectral Doppler and no spontaneous echo contrast was detected. While previous studies of astronauts in both short-duration (less than 7 days) and long-duration spaceflight have demonstrated a stable increase in IJV CSA20,23,24, the absence of flow anomalies and spontaneous echo contrast in all four astronauts suggests a potential difference from respective long-duration spaceflight data and the possibility of lower risk of IJV thrombosis in the early period of microgravity exposure. The effect of inspiratory resistance breathing using an impedance threshold device (ITD) on IJV filling (reflected as CSA) appeared more pronounced on the right side, but varied among astronauts and did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3d, t-test, P values > 0.05). Notably, the measurements were concordant among astronauts pre-flight and in-flight (Fig. 3d), indicating reliable data collection and encouraging further inquiries into the potential of ITD-like interventions as a countermeasure against thrombosis in cases of clinical concern with commensurate flow anomalies.Otolith asymmetry and motion sickness The neurovestibular system is adversely affected by the microgravity environment of space through altered neural processing and transduction of sensory measurements25,26. The otolith organs are an integral component of the neurovestibular system that transduce sensory effects, particularly linear acceleration and gravity. Any normal asymmetry between otoliths on the two sides of the head is compensated for by central neural processes on Earth27; however, this compensation is inappropriate in microgravity, which can lead to vertical and torsional ocular misalignment. This asymmetry (as manifest in ocular misalignment) has also been associated with increased susceptibility to space motion sickness (SMS)25. Ocular alignment was assessed in the Inspiration4 crew, as a proximal measure of otolith asymmetry, during the pre-flight and post-flight phases using a computerized test that measured vertical (vertical alignment nulling (VAN)) and torsional (torsional alignment nulling (TAN)) ocular misalignment. VAN and TAN data collected on the Inspiration4 crew showed no consistent and systematic effects of spaceflight from pre-flight to post-flight. VAN, however, exhibited different patterns between astronauts who experienced SMS in-flight compared to those who did not (Fig. 4). Two of the four Inspiration4 crew (50%) experienced SMS, which is consistent with earlier reports that 50–67% of astronauts experience SMS during short-duration spaceflight28,29. Astronauts who did not experience SMS (Fig. 4a,c) exhibited consistent vertical misalignment both pre-flight and post-flight, and that misalignment was different after the flight than before the flight. This is presumably because post-flight testing reflects the in-flight adaptive state, and that 0g-adapted state should, in general, be different from the 1g state (P values < 0.001; Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 6). A statistical evaluation of the proposed interpretation of SMS susceptibility was developed to validate these observations (Supplementary Information). Fig. 4. Ocular misalignment before and after short-duration spaceflight. Open in a new tab a–d, The response of the neurovestibular system to short-duration spaceflight was indexed by ocular misalignment, as a proximal measure of otolith asymmetry. The degree of vertical ocular misalignment (VAN) is shown for each of the n = 4 astronauts as follows: C001 (a), C002* (b), C003 (c), C004* (d). An asterisk denotes astronauts who reported SMS in-flight; in these astronauts (C002 and C004), VAN scores were not significantly different post-flight relative to pre-flight. Each box represents one test session (n = 2 pre-flight and n = 2 post-flight, for each astronaut), in which 11 VAN trials were performed. The horizontal bar in each box represents the median of that dataset, the box encompasses the central 50% of the dataset and the whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values that are not outliers (outliers, which are more than three scaled median absolute deviations from the median, are indicated by circles). Two-sample two-tailed t-tests were performed for each astronaut individually to determine consistency of pre-flight and post-flight measures, and significant differences (indicating spaceflight adaptation) between pre-flight and post-flight measures.Extended Data Fig. 6. Ocular misalignment before and after short-duration spaceflight. Open in a new tab Data as presented in Fig. 5. Red boxes indicate the grouping, for each astronaut, of pre-flight and the post-flight tests; an asterisk (*) denotes astronauts who experienced space motion sickness (SMS) in-flight. This shows consistency of pre-flight and post-flight tests in the non-SMS astronauts (C001 and C003). Vertical offsets of the boxes in each graph show change from pre-flight to post-flight, indicative of adaptive change during flight (larger adaptive change associated with lack of SMS). Boxes are drawn manually, to enclose the median in each case.Cardiovascular responses to spaceflight While some wearable devices have previously flown in other spaceflight missions, crew of the Inspiration4 mission used Apple Watches, which feature a rich set of biometrics that can be collected on astronauts and have the potential to be useful in future missions. Astronaut cardiovascular physiology was measured with the Series 6 Apple Watch, which astronauts donned on FD2 and wore for an average of 1.3 ± 0.1 days in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 1). Significant changes across mission phases were observed for crew heart rate (Extended Data Fig. 7a,e) and heart rate variability (HRV; Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7b,f), and differential heart rate changes between astronauts were also observed (F = 9.46, P < 0.0001). Studies of heart rate in spaceflight have yielded mixed findings30, and relative to pre-flight, only C004 exhibited decreased heart rate (Supplementary Table 5), as well as increased HRV (Fig. 5d). These cardiovascular changes in C004 were accompanied by lower blood oxygen saturation in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 7c,g), yet post-flight measures of cardiovascular function did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) upon return to Earth. Consistent with earlier studies31, increased heart rate post-flight, relative to pre-flight, was observed for two astronauts, C001 and C002; C001 also exhibited elevated blood oxygen saturation levels post-flight. Furthermore, the crew exhibited substantially lower overall activity in-flight relative to pre-flight (F = 6.65, P < 0.0001), which was accompanied by reduced active energy expenditure (Extended Data Fig. 7d,h; F = 9.29, P = 0.0001); this reduced energy expenditure was driven by C001.

The cabin environment was measured via sensors in the spacecraft, while sound pressure levels were measured using the Apple Watch. Environmental variables fluctuated over time in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 5). The Inspiration4 crew were confined to the Dragon capsule, which has a volume of 9.3 m3, and were free to move about the cabin. The Dragon cabin environment is nominally controlled to 14.7 psi and 21% O2, in-flight O2 partial pressures averaged 3.1 psia (range = 3.0–3.3 psia; equivalent to 20.4–22.4%) and CO2 averaged 0.8 mmHg (range = 0.4–2.0 mmHg). Temperature and humidity are controlled to maintain a comfortable short-sleeve environment; the crew had the capability to adjust the temperature, which averaged 25.5 °C (range = 21.8–27.9 °C) in-flight. Relative humidity could range between 25% and 75% (typically around 50%) and averaged 29.9% (range = 27.3–52.3%). The Dragon environmental conditions were equivalent to those on the ISS, with O2 ranging from 2.8 psia to 3.0 psia, temperature ranging from 18 °C to 25 °C, relative humidity of 25–75% and a cabin pressure ranging from 3.8 psia to 14.9 psia. Aside from one period with high sound pressure levels in three astronauts post-flight, sound pressure levels were similar across mission phases; of note, the spacecraft produced around 50 dBA of background noise. Noise exposure remained below the occupational 8 h exposure limit of 80 dBA for all but one data point (Extended Data Fig. 8e,g). In-flight, three of the four astronauts exhibited a significant and positive association between CO2 levels and higher HRV (Fig. 5f); however, other spacecraft environmental factors, including cabin pressure and temperature, did not exhibit consistent relationships with HRV.

For panels g and h, mean ± SEM with the n for each astronaut during that mission phase. Differences in-flight and post-flight relative to pre-flight were evaluated using mixed-effect models contrasting the in-flight and post-flight periods with pre-flight; post-hoc analyses testing for differences between astronauts were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method51. Significant associations are adjusted for multiple comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001.The Inspiration4 crew’s neurobehavioural functions Astronaut neurocognitive functioning and behavioural health are integral to the success of spaceflight missions. Astronauts performed the ten cognitive tests of NASA’s Cognition battery33 multiple times during each mission phase (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 1). Across cognitive domains and as consistent with earlier work34, astronaut cognitive performance was largely unaffected by short-duration spaceflight (Supplementary Table 6). Astronauts were, however, significantly slower on four cognition tests, and on three of them (psychomotor vigilance test, digit–symbol substitution task and motor praxis task assessing sustained attention, visual search and working memory and sensorimotor speed, respectively), astronauts were also less accurate (albeit statistically significantly so for the motor praxis task only), suggesting lower cognitive efficiency (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Note 3). These cognitive deficits were partially driven by one astronaut (C002), who exhibited a substantial performance deficit early in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 9). Except for the digit–symbol substitution task, cognitive performance post-flight did not differ from performance pre-flight (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 6). Extended Data Fig. 9. Profiles of astronaut cognitive performance on Cognition assays across mission phases. Open in a new tab Performance on each of the 10 Cognition tests is indexed by response speed in the left panel and accuracy in the right panel for each astronaut across mission phases (N = 26 Cognition administrations).

Nightly sleep duration of 6.7 ± 0.7 h in-flight was reported, which is modestly longer than previous studies35,36. Astronauts reported a moderate level of stress and high workload, similar to astronauts completing 6-month ISS missions36, but reported no other alertness or mood symptoms (Extended Data Fig. 10). In-flight mood and alertness did not differ from pre-flight, but astronauts reported being significantly happier and less bored post-flight (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 7). Although astronaut reports of adverse behavioural states were overall similar across mission phases, there was substantial variability both within and between astronauts in their behavioural responses to spaceflight (Extended Data Fig. 10). Furthermore, one astronaut (C003) exhibited a considerable increase in physical exhaustion upon return to Earth; overall, these behavioural responses to short-duration spaceflight are consistent with a previous report of astronauts in long-duration (6-month missions) spaceflight36. Extended Data Fig. 10. Astronaut report of behavioral states across mission phases. Open in a new tab Astronauts (N = 4) reported on their sleep duration and behavioral state using the Alertness and Mood Survey (AMS)50. For all 10 AMS items (panels b-k), astronauts rated their behavioral state using 11-point Likert-type scales for each item during all three phases of the mission (N = 26 for each item). AMS items are plotted on the full range of each scale and higher numbers represent higher ratings in the direction of the item at the bottom of each panel (e.g., for Poor Sleep Quality, a higher number represents worse sleep quality). For all AMS items except sleep quality and workload, astronauts were prompted to rate “how are you feeling right now?” a, Sleep duration (derived from self-reported sleep and wake-up times). b, Sleep quality (question: “How was the quality of your sleep?”; anchors: good—poor). c, High workload (question: “What was today’s workload?”; anchors: very low—very high). d, Sleepiness (anchors: not sleepy at all—very sleepy). e, Physical exhaustion (anchors: energetic—physically exhausted). f, Sickness (anchors: healthy—sick). g, Depressed (anchors: not depressed at all—very depressed). h, Unhappiness (anchors: happy—unhappy). i, Bored (anchors: good—poor). j, Monotonous (anchors: good—poor). k, Stressed (anchors: not stressed at all—very stressed).Discussion To understand the effects of short-duration spaceflight on the human body for the all-civilian spaceflight crew, this study performed a suite of experiments and collected a wide range of biospecimens before, during and after a 3-day orbital mission. This multidimensional battery included blood, stool, urine, biopsy and saliva samples, ultrasound measurements of the eye, jugular vein and bladder, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys and physiological data collected with an Apple smartwatch. These data showed some of the same signatures of long-duration spaceflight, such as inflammatory response, DNA damage response gene expression (and proteins), telomere elongation and immune signalling changes (Figs. 1 and 2), and demonstrated that such phenotypes can also be observed in the earliest phases of spaceflight and across a shorter mission time frame. Moreover, this mission also enabled new biomedical metrics for spaceflight, such as RNA methylation, single-nucleus chromatin, single-cell expression metrics and spatial transcriptomics. Overall, this work demonstrated that a diverse civilian crew can conduct scientific experiments, process samples and significantly contribute to spaceflight research with minimal risk. Although two astronauts presented with SMS, most metrics (for example, IJV size, heart rate, complete blood count metrics, gene expression and cytokines) were either stable or quickly reverted to pre-flight levels (baseline) after landing on Earth. The development of diagnostic, point-of-care devices that can detect and quantify multiple biomarkers is critical to monitor astronauts’ healthcare for future spaceflight missions and to help guide medical interventions. This mission showed that a VFI can be used to detect antigens and, more generally, protein markers37–39. Due to flight certification constraints required for all technologies used in spaceflight, the desiccant usually placed in the packaging kit to avoid high humidity exposure during long-term storage had to be removed, and has been identified as the main cause for the alteration of the assay efficiency in-flight. For future missions, reagent and system stability studies will have to determine optimal storage conditions without the use of hygroscopic compounds. Despite this obstacle, the 0g-VFI demonstrated its robustness of operation in space, and the simplicity of its user interface allowed for its use by untrained non-scientists, supporting the feasibility of such point-of-care diagnostic systems for several applications on additional specimen types, including for deep-space missions. The Inspiration4 ultrasound imaging experiment pursued three research objectives, which were to examine (1) urinary bladder function in microgravity, (2) IJV flow with and without intervention by inspiratory resistance and (3) microgravity-associated changes in ocular morphology. The choice of targets was motivated by high-priority concerns and risks reported over the years of ISS missions. For example, flow anomalies in the IJV (for example, severe stasis, flow reversal) frequently develop in ISS crew members in the later stages of long-duration spaceflight20–22; however, such alterations in cardiovascular function have been less studied in the earlier days of spaceflight when precursors to cardiovascular risks may begin to emerge23. In the Inspiration4 mission, IJV flow anomalies were not observed in any of the four astronauts, suggesting that flow anomalies develop later in-flight. The lack of IJV flow anomalies also diverge from Earth-based simulations of microgravity (head-down tilt), which demonstrate IJV and other vascular alterations after five days of exposure23. If corroborated by future studies in short-duration spaceflight, this finding may further our understanding of the mechanisms and progression pattern of flow degradation in the left IJV during sustained microgravity. Inspiratory resistance reduced right IJV CSA by an average of 36% pre-flight (supine) and 29% in-flight but did not reach statistical significance in this small cohort of astronauts. This trend suggests facilitated IJV drainage due to resistance breathing, and the experiment demonstrated a simplified in-flight screening method, with resistance breathing as an option to correct anomalous IJV flow. Overall, these findings bode well for the cardiovascular safety profile of short-duration missions, although future studies that address other anatomical targets are needed, as the effects of spaceflight are not uniform throughout the cardiovascular system23,24. A better understanding of the cardiovascular risks could alleviate some of the spaceflight health concerns for private citizens with diverse health backgrounds and medical histories, although notably, no health issues were observed in the Inspiration4 crew. The Inspiration4 mission undertook ultrasound imaging-based human research in full crew autonomy, with minimal pre-flight familiarization and reliance on experiment-specific just-in-time (JIT) instruction. Probing the potential limitations of miniaturized ultrasound technology combined with the rapid deployment and complete crew autonomy was an inseparable part of the experiment. This autonomy is in stark contrast to the ISS experience, where all imaging sessions are conducted with a traditional device and in real-time interaction with experts in the mission control centre. The anatomical and technical quality of the images, expressed as overall success scores, appeared inversely related to the complexity of the autonomous procedures. Bladder imaging (the simplest procedure) and IJV imaging (intermediate difficulty and complexity) each had similar scores, well above the usability threshold. Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. In this study, all but the most intricate procedures could be successfully performed by minimally trained users with the aid of appropriate JIT materials. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). Payloads consisting of a miniaturized imaging system with an intuitive interface can enable future experiments featuring short lead and training times, rapid deployment, flexible schedules and data collection autonomy, which will enable scientific research opportunities even on the most constrained of spaceflight missions. Studying ocular misalignment and otolith symmetry in short-duration spaceflight is not without caveats. First, the Inspiration4 results (Fig. 4) are based on comparing pre-flight and post-flight tests and relating that comparison to in-flight SMS. The ultimate goal is to use pre-flight tests alone to predict in-flight susceptibility, which is planned for future flights. The incidence of SMS was 50% in the Inspiration4 mission, which is consistent with the reported incidence in short-duration spaceflight29. Second, there is no relation between motion sickness susceptibility in parabolic flight and susceptibility in orbital flight, yet early work on torsional alignment was performed in parabolic flight to predict susceptibility in orbital flight40. Third, our results with VAN are promising for SMS prediction, while results with TAN are not (of note, the original work41 relating SMS to ocular skew was done with torsion). Finally, SMS has multiple contributing factors and multiple manifestations that vary between individuals, and thus it may be unrealistic to think that a single measure will continue to have high predictive power in a larger population. Consistent with studies of astronauts and cosmonauts completing both short- and long-duration spaceflight missions34–36, collecting objective measures of astronaut cardiovascular functions and neurocognitive functioning, as well as subjective measures of sleep and astronaut behavioural states, is feasible in commercial astronaut crews throughout short-duration orbital missions. The Inspiration4 crew provided valid and usable data on cardiovascular physiology, cognitive performance and behavioural states across mission phases that can translate to the general public3,42, which is important as trained astronauts from international space agencies are not necessarily representative of the average individual. The effects of short-duration spaceflight on Inspiration4 crew cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance were modest, although there was substantial interindividual variability in the response to spaceflight, as previously observed34,43,44. Studies of cognitive performance have generally found that astronauts maintain relatively high levels of performance in spaceflight, although this may be a function of the duration of spaceflight missions, where performance decrements manifest with longer mission durations1,34. In this study, accuracy on eight of the ten (80%) cognition tests was unaffected by short-duration spaceflight (Fig. 5). There was, however, more variability in astronaut response speed on neurocognitive tasks, where slower response speeds were observed on four cognition tests, a finding consistent with earlier reports of astronaut response slowing during short-duration spaceflight (that is, less than or equal to 10 days in spaceflight shuttle missions)45,46. Although previous studies have not found large cognitive performance deficits in spaceflight, this may be due to the timing of neurocognitive testing, which often does not occur on the first day in-flight, but up to four days in-flight, at which point cognitive deficits may have dissipated. Furthermore, the observed changes in response speed may, to some extent, be associated with neurovestibular and sensorimotor alterations induced by spaceflight26,47. While astronaut sleep durations less than 6 h on the ISS have been associated with psychomotor slowing, Inspiration4 astronauts averaged 6.7 h of sleep per night in-flight and thus the contribution of sleep loss to slower response speeds would be modest if present36. Astronauts did not report overtly negative behavioural states in-flight (for example, depression, stress), but they reported more happiness and less boredom post-flight relative to pre-flight (Fig. 5). Significantly, all data from this study are stored in multiple controlled-access repositories for easy access, including TrialX, NASA’s Open Science Data Repository and GeneLab, the SOMA data portal and the Commercial Spaceflight Data Repository, which facilitates the collection of mission-specific research, medical data and biospecimens to be stored in a permanent electronic data and tissue repository for future scientific research. These data also include qualitative survey data received via mobile apps, DICOM-standard images from portable ultrasound devices, data from wearables (for example, heart rate, electrocardiogram), biospecimen information, cell processing details48 and the environmental/mission data from the Crew Dragon capsule (for example, cabin pressure, temperature and humidity, spacecraft telemetry), which can help guide exploration-class future missions49. Finally, the repository contains a visualization dashboard for researchers to view summary analytics and access individual observations and data files, which has been added to TRISH’s enhancing exploration platforms and analogue definition programme. Although the Inspiration4 mission was the first all-civilian crew to complete a short-duration, orbital spaceflight mission while collecting repeated multidimensional measurements of biological and behavioural function relevant to the challenges of spaceflight, the study is not without limitations. Although the total sample of n = 4 astronauts is small, it is not inconsistent with previous studies of astronaut cognitive performance in spaceflight. While data collection spaceflight is challenging and limited by numerous factors (for example, cost, limited time and access to astronauts), longitudinal sampling of measures within and across mission phases can promote statistical power (Supplementary Note 1). This study did not have age- and sex-matched controls on Earth; however, repeated measures within the Inspiration4 crew across mission phases allow for astronauts to serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight (that is, baseline) levels as a reference. Future studies, or additional studies with equivalent design, of civilian astronauts in short-duration spaceflight with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the findings or to assign any possible causal links. Finally, it is worth noting that the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to address how the biological and behavioural responses of the Inspiration4 crew relate to those of professional astronauts or cosmonauts, or those with career-long exposure to spaceflight. Furthermore, the research on the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, or to recommend spaceflight for future civilian passengers; the Inspiration4 research projects were also not tasked with making judgements for future crew selection or fitness for spaceflight. The selection of astronauts for spaceflight is exclusive to international space agencies (governmental or commercial). Nonetheless, the Inspiration4 data, along with data from other civilian spaceflight missions, may contribute to the development of reference ranges and pre-flight preparatory tasks (for example, behavioural testing in confined environments) that can help guide future crew selection and mission planning.Conclusions While broad in its research scope, this study represents only the beginning. Anatomical and physiological variability, small sample size, the operational complexities of a highly constrained mission and limited skill management capabilities combined to preclude confident conclusions on many physiological variables. However, as intended by the TRISH, enhancing exploration platforms and analog definition, and SOMA programmes, these Inspiration4 data will serve as a rich foundation for scaling and enhancing the knowledge base on early phases of space physiology, and expanding our understanding of spaceflight-associated effects on human health. Future missions can also include telemedicine, more autonomous data collection, next-generation sequencing-based in-flight omics assays and related diagnostics tools. Excitingly, some of these same astronauts will be present on future missions and/or contribute to long-term studies of astronaut health, which will help delineate the short- and long-term impacts of spaceflight and continue to prepare future astronauts for their missions. Finally, it is worth noting that collaboration with government, academia and the private sector at the same time led to lessons learned that should be useful to investigators embarking on similar endeavours in future civilian spaceflight missions. Specifically, co-ordination among diverse research teams can be enabled by agile funding entities (for example, TRISH, SpaceX, philanthropy) and a dedicated project manager. Also, a single institutional review board (IRB) protocol, such as that put in place by TRISH, can simplify subject consenting, while a standardized database provider (TrialX, funded by TRISH) was critical for data ingestion, cross-institute sharing and standardization for future cross-mission analyses and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Finally, the consent and release forms of study participants were envisioned for long-term use, with datasets managed under the oversight of a data release board, and for these precious samples to be utilized and characterized for many years to come.Methods Subjects and consent Four adult non-professional astronauts were selected to participate in the Inspiration4 mission. All subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which included the collection and use of their samples and data in research protocols at Weill Cornell Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine/TRISH and collaborating institutions; the study was approved by multiple IRBs and included the following IRB protocols: Weill Cornell Medicine IRB no. 21-05023569, WCG-IRB 1309934, Multimodal Evaluation of Spaceflight Participants Health – SpaceX Inspiration-4 Mission; Baylor College of Medicine/Translational Research Institute for Space Health IRB no. 1316696, WCG-IRB 20214456, Commercial Spaceflight Data Repository. Subjects consented to the storage of their de-identified, coded research data in a secure, password-protected database at SpaceX, Weill Cornell Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine/TRISH, and the institutions of study co-investigators. Subjects also consented to the publication of the results of this research while maintaining their confidentiality.Multi-omics methods Datasets generated for multi-omics profiling span nine different biospecimen sample types: whole blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), extracellular vesicles and particles, dried blood spots, skin biopsies, skin swabs and capsule swabs. These samples were subject to a spectrum of multi-omic assays, including WGS, clonal haematopoiesis, direct RNA sequencing, single-nuclei RNA sequencing, single-nuclei ATAC-seq, single-cell B cell repertoire and T cell repertoire V(D)J sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, cell-free DNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Additional biomarkers were quantified using a CLIA lab for complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and cytokine panel. These data types were generated across ten time points in total: three pre-flight (L − 92, L − 44, L − 3), three in-flight (FD1, FD2, FD3), one post-flight (R + 1) and three recovery (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194). Multi-omic feature counts describe the datasets published in refs. 4,5. Transcripts detected in whole blood RNA sequencing were assembled using StringTie52. m6A modifications were quantified using m6Anet53 with a probability threshold of 0.9. Genes detected from skin biopsy had a count of at least five from the normalized count matrix from the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. The number of ATAC-seq peaks and genes detected from the single-nuclei data was quantified using the cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) count algorithm from 10x Genomics. We followed the 10x single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported48 and adapted for this data as described here. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were deduplicated, filtered for human sequences via alignment to the human reference genome (Hg38) and trimmed for adaptor contamination. Fungal, viral and bacterial taxonomic composition was computed via masked read alignment to a database containing all complete genomes in RefSeq using kraken2 (confidence = 0.2)54. For assembly-based approaches, quality-controlled (unmasked) reads were assembled with MetaSPAdes55. Bins were generated with MetaBAT2 (ref. 56), and Open-Reading-Frames were identified with bakta57 and clustered into a non-redundant gene catalogue with mmseqs2 (ref. 58). Assembled viral genomes were identified among contigs with CheckV59. Additional details can be found in ref. 10.Virome methods Highly multiplexed, epitope-resolved IgG reactivity analysis across the human virome was performed on reconstituted dried blood samples using DNA-barcoded peptide (PepSeq) assays. The HV2 library has been previously described15 and consists of 15,000 30mer peptides covering 80 viral species and selected based on earlier evidence of reactivity in other cohorts. PepSeq libraries were synthesized and used to profile IgG binding, as previously described16,17. Briefly, DNA-barcoded peptide libraries were generated using bulk in vitro enzymatic reactions, starting with the PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates and their transcription to generate mRNA. The product was ligated to a hairpin oligonucleotide adaptor bearing a puromycin molecule tethered by a polyethylene glycol spacer and used as a template in an in vitro translation reaction. Finally, a reverse transcription reaction, primed by the adaptor hairpin, was used to generate cDNA, and the original mRNA was removed using RNAse. To perform serological assays, 0.1 pmol of the resulting DNA-barcoded peptide library (5 μl) was added to 5 μl of neat, reconstituted blood spot solution and incubated overnight. The binding reaction was applied to prewashed protein G-bearing beads, washed, eluted and indexed using barcoded DNA oligos. Following PCR cleanup, products were pooled, quantified and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument yielding a depth of more than 900,000 reads per sample. Z-score enrichment values for each peptide in each sample were generated from raw sequence reads in a two-step process using PepSIRF v.1.4.0, an open-source software package for the analysis of highly multiplexed serology60 data. First, reads were demultiplexed and mapped to members of the HV2 library using the demux module to generate integer count values for each sample peptide. Next, peptides with similar abundances in the buffer-only negative control samples were grouped into bins and used to generate z-scores for each data point, representing the distance (in standard deviations) of each data point from its unenriched distribution mean. log2-transformed offset-adjusted z-scores (log2(z + 8) − 3) were used for downstream analyses. At an adjusted z-score threshold of 0.75, we detected 45 virus species (Supplementary Table 3) for which at least 1 peptide was reactive in at least 1 sample. To identify viral events, we applied peptide set enrichment analysis to all pairs of consecutive samples as previously described19, and used a P value threshold of 1 × 10−5.Membrane printing 0g-VFI membranes were fabricated using nitrocellulose membrane sheets (9 × 8 cm), which were prepared into target membranes on a bench-top CO2 laser cutter at 1% power, 100% speed and 3 mm depth. These target membranes have circular discs (6 mm diameter) cut into them in a 6 × 5 design with fiducial markers for targeting the dispensing locations during microarray printing. Control antibody reagent (mouse IgG), rabbit anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and goat anti-human IgM (109-005-129, Jackson ImmunoResearch) capture antibodies were diluted to working concentrations (0.5 mg ml−1) using filtered 1× PBS. In a clean-room environment, a Nano-Plotter NP2.1 was used for non-contact piezoelectric microarray dispensing of capture antibodies onto the circular discs of a target nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm pore size). To prevent evaporation of reagents during printing, an ambient humidity of 55% was maintained using a humidifier. The nozzle hydrostatic pressure was set with the water level of the pressure compensation vessel at the pipette tip height. Spot-front-end software was utilized to co-ordinate a spotting plan for use in the Nano-Plotter Controller software (NPC16) to dispense a nine-spot pattern (350 µm period) of the antibody microarray onto the centre of each circular disc. A 384-well microplate was used to aspirate the antibodies during dispensing. The test reagents were dispensed in 20 droplets per spot at their respective working concentrations at the top two rows (three spots per row for each reagent) of the nine-spot pattern. Ten droplets of the control reagent were dispensed at the bottom three spots of the nine-spot pattern. The immunoassay membranes were then stored in aluminium pouches with silica bead desiccant for later use.Preparation of conjugation pad Conjugate pads were fabricated using polyester fibre with binder (Grade 6614, Ahlstrom Munksjo), which were cut into circular discs (10.5 mm) on a bench-top CO2 laser cutter. Gold nanoparticles conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (kindly provided by Dr AuCoin at the University of Nevada-Reno) were incubated with mouse anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and IgM (MA5-14729, ThermoFisher) for 10 min. The conjugate mix was then dispensed and dried on the conjugate pads at 25 °C for 2 h.Assembly of vertical flow apparatus The 0g-VFI consists of a stacked multilayer of pads and membranes assembled in 3D-printed plastic caps and capsules (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The sandwich immunoassay on the 0g-VFI is performed at the multiplexed sensing nitrocellulose membrane, which contains the nine immunoreaction spots. Above the 0g-VFI membrane are functional paper layers, which decrease flow surface area to achieve uniform vertical flow (flow-directing pad), decrease flow rate to increase intensity (retarding pad), generate the assay colour (conjugation pad) and collect plasma samples (sample pad). These layers are all contained in a 3D-printed pad holder, placed in a membrane housing that allows contact between the 0g-VFI membrane and cotton absorbing pads. The user-friendly device also contains capsules within which are wet pads (assay or washing buffer) that trigger fluid transfer once screwed to the membrane housing and placed in contact with the absorbing pads. In total, the 0g-VFI contains four modules consisting of the membrane housing protected with a cap, assay buffer capsule, washing buffer capsule and magnifier cap, all of which fit in small zip bags (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Overall, the assay takes up to 20 min due to its simple assembly sequence using the screw cap and reservoir design of the 0g-VFI platform (Extended Data Fig. 3c). A user manual and instruction video were made to detail the workflow procedure to SpaceX personnel and Inspiration4 crew. The user manual was integrated in the 0g-VFI kit and was thus available in-flight. The Inspiration4 crew were trained by SpaceX personnel and were instructed to work in pairs for sample collection and to self-perform the 0g-VFI procedure. All plastic components of the 0g-VFI were designed in SolidWorks and 3D-printed in house at the Center for Applied NanoBioscience and Medicine using a Surgical Guide Resin material from Formlabs. Using the Formlabs 3B stereolithography printer, the 0g-VFI was printed and then washed for 20 min in 99% isopropyl alcohol to clear loose and uncured resin. Curing was then performed under intense ultraviolet light at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by trimming of the support scaffolds. First, the different pad layers were stacked inside of the pad holder as follows (ordered top to bottom): sample pad (made from chopped glass with binder (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo)), polyethersulfone filter, conjugate pad, retarding and flow-directing pads both made of thin glass fibres (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo). All layers were assembled with double-sided, medical-grade pressure-sensitive adhesive (ARcare 90106NB). Second, a 3.5-cm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 320, Ahlstrom Munksjo) was positioned in the membrane housing with a 6-mm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 222, Ahlstrom Munksjo) on top, both acting as absorbent pads. The 0g-VFI printed membrane was then placed on top of the absorbing pads and 400 µl of blocking buffer (10 mM borate buffer (pH 8) with 2.5% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and 0.1% sucrose filtered through a 0.2 µm polyethersulfone filter membrane) was pipetted on it and incubated for 30 min. Then, the pad holder was positioned inside the housing membrane and the device was tightly closed with a lid. Separately, wet pads saturated with a TritonX100 (0.1%), albumin (0.5%), PBS (0.1 M) solution and a 50 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (washing buffer) were placed in the assay buffer pad capsule and the washing buffer pad capsule, respectively. Plasma was separated from fingerstick-collected whole blood using a modified A-PON plasma separator cartridge (GattaCo). As drawing blood using conventional methods is difficult in spaceflight for novice astronauts, whole blood was collected via fingerstick using a Food and Drug Administration-approved lancet to promote successful sample collection by the Inspiration4 crew.Ultrasound methods All imaging was performed with a Butterfly iQ+ handheld ultrasound system (Butterfly Network) with the Butterfly mobile app running on iPhone12 (Apple, Inc.). The device was used in approved preset modes for each procedure (ophthalmic, vascular and bladder). Eighty-nine imaging instances (multiframe cine of varied length) were collected pre-flight and 108 (7.68 GB) images were collected in-flight. All in-flight data (27 instances per astronaut on average; range = 18–32) were stored on the local device (iPhone 12) until secure transfer to a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) server upon return to Earth. Image analysis was performed in Osirix MD DICOM software (Pixmeo). Of the n = 106 in-flight imaging instances analysed, n = 73 were related to IJV, n = 14 to urinary bladder and n = 19 were ophthalmic. All astronauts were self-scanning operators. All pre-flight crew interactions (experiment briefing, familiarization and training, and baseline data collection) were conducted by SpaceX personnel using limited time allocations. Using a previously untested approach to experiment execution, the investigative team relied on experiment-specific JIT instructions to communicate both conceptual and procedural information to SpaceX personnel (for baseline data collection and familiarization) and to the Inspiration4 crew (for autonomous in-flight data collection). In-flight imaging data were obtained via self-scanning and used potable water as a coupling medium in lieu of ultrasound gel. Bladder scans were collected both pre- and post-void, whenever possible. IJV scans were performed with and without inspiratory resistance generated by an ITD (ResQGARD ITD7, Zoll). Given the risks to data quality posed by limitations of imaging expertise, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the JIT tools, a formalized data quality assessment was conducted in the initial phase of data analysis. This included the scoring of each imaging instance for anatomical accuracy and technical quality on a scale of 0–3 (0 = no useful information, 3 = clinical quality). Anatomical accuracy criteria included whether the target was clearly and contiguously visible, along with essential anatomical landmarks; technical quality criteria included elements such as image clarity, gain, acoustical interference, artefact and shadowing. An overall success score was derived as the mean of these two scores, with a usability threshold set at 2.0. This quality filter served to reject anatomically inaccurate or technically flawed images. To determine whether the success of imaging instances varied by anatomical target, a one-way ANOVA tested for in-flight differences in imaging success scores among anatomical targets (that is, bladder, IJV and eye); post hoc pairwise comparisons between anatomical targets were conducted via Tukey’s honest significant difference. To evaluate the effect of impedance breathing on IJV CSA, a series of paired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests were conducted; differences between normal and impedance breathing were evaluated by averaging IJV CSA for each condition within each mission phase (that is, pre-flight and in-flight).Ocular misalignment methods The otolith organs of the vestibular system transduce linear acceleration and gravity. The sense organs consist of a mass of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) that overlie a membrane that is innervated with hair cells. Motion of the crystals relative to the hair cells bends the hair cells, and this bending modifies their firing rates and so provides information on linear acceleration to the central vestibular system. While generally symmetric, there is reason to believe that there are slight asymmetries between the otolith organs on the two sides of the head, in otoconial mass or synaptic sensitivity. This asymmetry is compensated by central neural processes27, but this compensation becomes inappropriate in gravity fields other than 1g, leading to changes in vertical and torsional ocular alignment61,62. In particular, the magnitude of torsional misalignment in altered g levels has been associated with susceptibility to SMS40,41,63. G-dependent changes in vertical alignment have also been demonstrated in parabolic flight and laboratory studies62,64. Data on SMS in-flight were obtained via self-report. A perceptual-nulling technique was used to measure misalignment between the eyes (skew) in both vertical and torsional directions65. For these tests, the subject views a red line and a blue line on the touchscreen of a tablet computer, through colour-matched red and blue filters, one over each eye. This provides independent images to each eye. Since the test is performed in darkness, there is no visual information that is seen by both eyes together, and hence there are no visual cues to align the eyes (which would fuse the images on the two retinas). One line remains fixed on the screen, while the other line is positioned by the subject, either vertically or torsionally. The subject’s goal is to adjust one line until it appears to be aligned with the other, stationary, line (that is, to null any apparent vertical or rotational offset between the lines). The final amount by which the lines are separated from one another vertically or rotated relative to one another provides a measure of vertical or torsional ocular misalignment, respectively, which produces measures of VAN and TAN. Astronauts completed VAN and TAN measures twice pre-flight and twice post-flight, where each session consisted of 11 VAN and 11 TAN trials. There was no in-flight testing. Statistical testing to evaluate associations of torsional (TAN) and vertical (VAN) ocular misalignment with SMS were carried out via a series of two-sample t-tests within each astronaut individually to provide information on the following: (1) whether the two pre-flight datasets are the same or different from each other, (2) whether the two post-flight datasets are the same or different from each other and (3) whether the (grouped) pre-flight data are different from the (grouped) post-flight data. The t-tests were performed after removing outliers, which were defined as values more than three scaled median absolute deviations from the median, where median absolute deviation is a measure of the deviation of the values from the median (analogous to the standard deviation for data from normal distributions) and can be reduced to a sequential decision tree for prediction of individual SMS susceptibility (Supplementary Note 2). There are several reasons for this individual testing as opposed to a pooled analysis across subjects. First, the high variability across subjects (typical of many neurovestibular assessments), combined with the small subject pool, makes it unlikely that there would be sufficient statistical power in a pooled analysis. Second, individual testing permits a stepwise approach in which a series of tests can lead to a predictive metric. Finally, SMS is notoriously idiosyncratic, and spaceflight measures are subject to many confounds, which supports a focused longitudinal examination.Cardiovascular function The Apple Watch Series 6 was used to objectively measure cardiovascular function, which was indexed by blood oxygen saturation levels, heart rate and HRV, as well as activity and energy consumption. The Apple Watch also measured sound pressure levels. The crew donned the Apple Watch for selected periods in all three phases of the mission, including pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight (Extended Data Fig. 1). The crew donned the Apple Watch from L − 22 to L − 20 and had an average wear time of 2.7 ± 0.3 (s.d.) days (range = 2.4–3.0 days), in-flight from FD2 to FD3 with an average wear time of 1.2 ± 0.1 (s.d.) days (range = 1.2–1.4 days) and post-flight from R + 0 to R + 10 with an average wear time of 5.8 ± 3.4 (s.d.) days (range = 2.2–9.1 days).Neurocognitive functioning Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using NASA’s cognition test battery33, which consists of 10 brief cognitive tests that probe a range of neurocognitive domains relevant to the challenges of spaceflight and includes the psychomotor vigilance test, matrix reasoning test, abstract matching, line orientation test, visual object learning test, motor praxis task, emotion recognition task, digit–symbol substitution task, fractal 2-back and balloon analogue risk test. Developed for high-performing astronauts, cognition has been deployed in long-duration spaceflight studies1, as well as in ground-based studies that simulate aspects of spaceflight in analogue environments66–68. Cognition was administered with the Joggle Research App (Pulsar Informatics, Inc.) on an iPad Mini Series 4 twice pre-flight (L − 47 and L − 22), up to three times in-flight and twice post-flight (R + 0 and R + 1). Cognition data were corrected for practice and stimulus set effects after applying another correction for the fact that tests were performed on an iPad instead of a laptop69,70. After these corrections, the expectation is that test results do not change with repeated administration.Alertness and mood survey Before performing each cognition test battery, astronauts reported on their behavioural state using the AMS50 via the Qualtrics application on the Apple iPad Mini Series 4. Developed for astronauts, the 18-item AMS measures behavioural responses to the challenges of both long- and short-duration spaceflight. Fourteen of the 18 AMS items were surveyed in the Inspiration4 crew to reduce time burden, and the four items that were removed had significant overlap with other AMS items. Ten AMS items (monotony, boredom, depression, stress, physical exhaustion, sickness, unhappiness, sleepiness, workload and sleep quality) prompted astronauts to rate each item using 11-point Likert scales (range = 0–10). The remaining AMS items assessed astronaut sleep timing and duration, crew conflict and medication use (stimulant/depressant).Statistical analysis of cognition, AMS and Apple watch data All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4. Before statistical analysis of cognitive performance, all cognition data were standardized via z-scoring to facilitate comparisons across the different neurocognitive domains, as well as to allow the effects to be interpreted as effect sizes. Mixed-effects models using PROC MIXED with a random subject intercept were used to test astronaut behavioural and physiological responses to short-duration spaceflight across mission phases. Repeated measures were nested within subjects and differences between responses during both the in-flight and post-flight periods were tested relative to the pre-flight period using change scores generated for each astronaut from the average of an outcome for each mission phase. Post hoc analyses that tested differences between astronauts and mission phases were corrected for multiple comparisons based on the false discovery rate method with a significance threshold of P < 0.05 (refs. 51); both unadjusted and adjusted P values are reported. For crew-level differences between mission phases, Type III effects are reported.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Online content Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information, details of author contributions and competing interests, and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41586-024-07648-x.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (58.9KB, docx) The Supplementary Information contains Supplementary Notes 1–3 and Tables 1–7.

    "title": "Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167063/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors. Subject terms: Genetics, Molecular biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein “caps” at the natural ends of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeres face two major challenges as a result of their physical location: the inability to replicate to the very end of linear DNA molecules (the end replication problem)1,2; and circumventing activation of inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) (the end protection problem)3,4. Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of highly conserved repetitive G-rich sequence (5’-TTAGGG/CCCTAA-3’)5–7, which in humans range in length from ~5 to 15 kb and end in 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs of ~30–500 nucleotides8,9. The 3’ single-stranded telomeric overhang serves as the substrate for telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto newly synthesized telomeres10. Telomeric 3’ overhangs also facilitate formation of protective terminal structural features termed t-loops11,12. Telomeres are dynamic structures associated with a myriad of telomere-specific and nonspecific proteins, six of which comprise the shelterin complex and include the telomere-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, which contributes to regulation of telomerase activity, t-loop formation, and protection of chromosome ends8,13–15. Normal human somatic cells have very low levels of telomerase activity, and thus telomeres shorten with continued cell division, as well as with oxidative stress and a variety of lifestyle factors, including chronic stressors and environmental exposures16–22. Telomere shortening is a key molecular driver of aging and determinant of age-related degenerative pathologies, including dementias, cardiovascular disease, and cancer23–25. Telomerase activity is sufficient to maintain telomere length only in highly proliferative populations like germ-line and stem cells, and the vast majority of cancers26. The remaining ~10–15% of human cancers maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent, recombination- mediated Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway27–29. ALT tumors display a number of distinguishing features, including heterogeneous telomere lengths, increased frequencies of telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ETCRs)30–32. Due to their repetitive and heterochromatic nature, telomeres were long regarded as silent, rather unremarkable regions of the genome. Therefore, discovery of TElomere Repeat-containing RNA, or TERRA, propelled the field into new areas of research and potential mechanisms of telomere maintenance33,34. TERRA, a presumed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) until recently35, ranges in length from ~ one hundred to over 9000 nucleotides and is transcribed from CpG islands within subtelomeric regions towards chromosomal termini by RNA Pol II, predominantly using the C-rich leading-strand as a template and producing 5’-UUAGGG-3’ transcripts33,36,37. TERRA is thought to accumulate preferentially at short telomeres, where it contributes to end-capping structure and function via regulation of telomere length and maintenance of genome stability38–40. TERRA can also indirectly associate with telomeres via shelterin proteins41,42, as well as interact with an array of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1)43,44. In telomerase-positive human cells, TERRA is primarily chromatin-associated (bound) and not polyadenylated (polyA-), while “free” (unbound) TERRA is polyadenylated at its 3’-end (polyA+) and represents ~7% of total TERRA33,36. TERRA can associate with telomeric DNA to generate classic R-loops, which are formed by the annealing of nascent TERRA “in-cis” to the complementary C-rich telomere strand when it fails to be released and remains bound as a 3-stranded structure, with the G-rich telomere strand displaced and forming G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. There is also evidence that 3-stranded telomeric R-loops can be formed by a recombinational-like mechanism, in which TERRA invades a telomeric duplex “in-trans”45. In either case, and similar to t-loops46, TERRA transcription and telomeric R-loops represent sources of replication stress and DNA damage specifically within telomeres47,48. A different TERRA-based structure occurs via the direct binding of TERRA to a C-rich single-stranded telomere tract forming a 2-stranded TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid. Telomeric R-loops and TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids promote homology-directed repair at telomeres and are common in ALT cells, likely due to an abundance of TERRA38. One of the hallmarks of ALT is loss of function of the chromatin remodeling complex ATRX/DAXX [α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and its physical partner death domain-associated protein (DAXX)]49, which results in decompaction of telomeric chromatin50, thereby facilitating increased transcription and elevated levels of TERRA in ALT cells compared to normal cells or telomerase positive tumors with functional ATRX/DAXX51,52. Indeed, significantly increased frequencies of telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids were found in human U2OS ALT (osteosarcoma) cells compared to HeLa telomerase positive (cervical carcinoma) cells. Furthermore, removal of telomere-bound TERRA in ALT cells via overexpression of the endogenous RNA endonuclease RnaseH1 resulted in telomere shortening. Together, these results support critical roles for TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in telomere protection and recombination-mediated elongation in ALT cells38. Interestingly, TERRA has also been implicated in telomere mobility, a capability that would facilitate the physical telomere-telomere interaction required for recombination events to occur38,53. Such an “end-view” of TERRA is consistent with strict inhibition of DDRs at telomeres, which prevents spurious end-joining and genomic instability54,55, but also renders telomeres refractory to repair when damage does occur within and/or near telomeric regions; e.g., telomeric regions are especially susceptible to oxidative damage due to their G-rich makeup56,57. Telomere site-specific endonucleases have been developed and employed to address the question of how, and even whether, double-strand breaks (DSBs) within telomeres are repaired58–60. We previously utilized transient transfection of the well-characterized endonuclease TRAS1-EN fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62 in human BJ1-hTERT apparently normal fibroblasts, as well as in EJ-30 telomerase positive and U2OS (ALT) cancer cells, to evaluate telomeric DSBs specifically in G1-phase of the cell cycle63. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) provided a valuable biomarker of broken telomeres, as they represent co-localization of the well-established DSB marker gamma (γ)-H2AX at telomeres64. Importantly, induction of telomere-specific DSBs resulted in extensive tracks of resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA in all cell lines (independent of telomerase status), a previously proposed biomarker of the recombination dependent ALT pathway65,66. We posited that such highly reactive and exposed DNA “ends” were protected by binding complementary TERRA and forming telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids, so that they might persist into S/G2 for recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. Here, to better understand the role of telomeric RNA in the telomeric DDR, we investigated TERRA associated with ionizing radiation- and telomere specific-induced damage in normal human blood in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest), and in human U2OS (ALT) cells in vitro.",
    "methods": "Methods RNA-Seq for astronauts Sample collection methods for the four SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crewmembers have been detailed in full71,108. Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from K2 EDTA tubes using Ficoll separation. Single-nuclei libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the NASA Twins Study subjects, sample collection (and unavoidable loss of some samples), and poly(A) + RNA preparation was as described in Garrett-Bakelman et al. 67, and for the high-altitude climbers as in Luxton et al. 68. Simulated microgravity experiments De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from 2 healthy human donors between the ages of 25 and 36 from the Stanford University Blood Center (IRB eProtocol# 13942). PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. Cells were counted and re-suspended in complete media at 1 × 106 cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES). The cell suspension of PBMCs was loaded into 10 ml disposable rotating wall vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hr to generate simulated microgravity. For the 1 G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates. 1 G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For single-cell RNA sequencing, 1 × 104 PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller, and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200, and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550. The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). FASTQ (raw data) files were processed through 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 pipeline and all bases with quality below Q20 were truncated. The “cellranger count” function was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting, and then to generate the count matrixes. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. In vitro ionizing radiation experiments U2OS cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek II 154526) at a density of 5×105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow cell attachment. Cells were either sham-irradiated (0 Gy) or exposed to 137Cs γ-rays (2 Gy) while rotating in a Mark I irradiator (J.L Sheppard) located at Colorado State University. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours prior to fixation. For inhibition of transcription and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses, U2OS cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) 24 h prior to addition of 10 ug/ml Actinomycin-D (ActD; ThermoFisher). Cells were collected in Trizol at 3, 6, 8 and 24 hr after treatment. Control U2OS cells (DMSO treated) were collected after 24 h. RNA (500 ng) was used to make cDNA using standard reverse transcription (ImPromII-Reverse Transcription System-Promega). 25 µL reaction mixtures containing GAPDH or 18S rRNA primers, template (1:10,000 dilution cDNA) and QX200™ ddPCR™ EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad: 186–4034) were used for the ddPCR platform (QX200 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR™) System – Bio-Rad). Droplet generation and transfer of emulsified samples to PCR plates was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Instruction Manual, QX200™ Droplet Generator – Bio-Rad). The cycling protocol for the ddPCR platform started with a 95 °C enzyme activation step for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of a two-step cycling protocol (95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min) with a ramp rate of 2 °C/second. Post-cycling protocol was in accordance with the kit instructions (Bio-Rad –186–4034). For TERRA foci detection following inhibition of transcription, U2OS cells on chamber-slides were treated with 10 ug/ml ActD, 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure; cells were fixed and TERRA foci detected using RNA-FISH as described below. In vitro cell culture and transfections Human U2OS ALT cells (provided by Dr. Jiri Lucas, University of Copenhagen) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TRAS1-EN-TRF1 (EN-T) and TRF1-only plasmids, both driven by a CMV promoter and possessing a C-terminal FLAG-tag for visualization, were constructed from a CMV-driven TRAS1-EN-TRF1 plasmid obtained from Dr. Haruhiko Fujiwara (University of Tokyo). To generate the TRF1-only plasmid, the TRAS1-EN-TRF1construct was digested and the EN fragment removed. The mutated Cas9 pSpCas9m(BB)-2A-Puro (PX462) V2.0 (empty vector) plasmid (Addgene plasmid #62987; http://n2t.net/addgene:62987; RRID:Addgene_62987) was provided by Dr. Claudia Wiese (Colorado State University). Transient transfections of EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control; previously shown to recruit γ-H2AX to telomeres in U2OS ALT cells)88, and empty vector (EV; transfection control) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) were performed per manufacturer’s instructions on cell cultures reaching ~60–80% confluency in Opti-MEM (Gibco), which was replaced with regular media 8 h later. Untransfected (UT; negative control) populations had neither plasmid nor Lipofectamine, and unless specified otherwise all experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection. A U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin (green; S-G2-M) was established by transfecting cells with 0.5 ug of the Kan-FUCCI-Green (S-G2-M) plasmid (AM-V9016, Amalgaam) as previously described63. Briefly, plasmids were delivered using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media. One week later, cells were trypsinized and individual cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. A single positive clone was identified and expanded in the presence of 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate (GoldBio). After reaching ~90% confluency, cells were split into a 24-well plate, then 10 days later into a 12-well plate, and one week later into a 6-well plate. Cells were transferred into T-25 flasks, and then after 6 days into T-75 flasks. The DMEM media containing 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate was changed every two days. FUCCI-U2OS cells stably expressing FUCCI G2-Green were transiently transfected with EN-T or TRF1-only plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacture’s instruction. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media, and cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection. RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) For combined telomeric C-rich strand detection and FLAG staining, U2OS expressing FUCCI-SG2-M-Green cells were grown on 4-well chamber slides (MilliCell EZ). Forty-eight hours following transfection, chambers were removed and slides washed with Cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM PIPES at pH 6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose) containing 200 mM vanadyl for 30 seconds. Cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde in 10X PBS for 12 minutes at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer containing 200 mM vanadyl for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 70% ethanol and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (85%, 95%, 100%). For TERRA (UUAGGG) detection, 0.5 uM (TelC-Alexa 488, Bio-Synthesis) or (TelC- Alexa 647, Bio PNA 1013) Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA-CCCTAA) telomere probe was added to the hybridization buffer [50% (vol/vol) formamide, 2X (vol/vol) saline sodium citrate (SSC)] with 200 mM vanadyl, and denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. Hybridization buffer (200 ul) was added to each slide and slides were placed in a humidified chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Slides were washed twice in 50% formamide in 2X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), twice in 4X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), and once in 2X SSC + 0.1% NP-40 (2.5 min, 42 °C). RNaseA + H treatment To remove both bound and unbound TERRA, fixed and permeabilized U2OS and U2OS FUCCI-S-G2-M-Green cells were treated with a cocktail of 1 mg/ml RNaseA (degrades free RNA) and 15 U RNaseH (cleaves RNA from DNA:RNA hybrids) in 1X RNaseH buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence staining Blocking nonspecific immunoglobulin binding following FISH was carried out with 10% Goat Normal Serum (GNS) for 30 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody in 5% GNS overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times with 1X PBS at room temperature. Protein signals were visualized by incubating slides with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature and washed three times in 1X PBS. Lastly, slides were mounted and counterstained with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies and concentrations used include mouse antiFLAG (Sigma M2 F1804, 1:2000), rabbit anti-human FLAG (Sigma 7425 1:300), mouse anti-human TRF2 (Santa Cruz B-5, 1:200), and mouse anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139), clone JBW301 (Sigma 05-636, 1:10). Secondary antibodies and concentrations used include: Alexa-647 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A21236, 1:750), Alexa-594 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A11005, 1:750), Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit (ThermoFisher A11008, 1:750). For EdU detection, Click-iT EdU Alexa Flour 555 (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cell cycle analysis Utilizing a U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin, the cell cycle phase of interphase nuclei was determined. Definitive identification of cells in S-phase was achieved via pulse-labeling with the thymidine analog 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 min prior to fixation; 10 uM EdU (Click-iT, Invitrogen) was added to the culture and incubated at 37 °C. The scoring strategy to distinguish cell cycle phase of transiently transfected FUCCI U2OS cells was defined as cells positive for FLAG were in G1, cells positive for FLAG and EdU were in S, and cells positive for FLAG and GemininGFP were in G2. Microscopy and quantitative analysis Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 epi-fluorescent microscope outfitted with a 63X/1.4 N.A objective and a Coolsnap ES2 camera, and analyzed using Zen Blue software. Images were captured for co-localization 3-D analyses (50 per condition), each consisting of 21 Z-stacks (0.2 µm per plane) in combinations of 4 wavelengths (colors). Quantitative analysis was performed using Fiji (ImageJ2 software) and Cell Profiler using our customized pipeline for 3D reconstructions and simultaneous dual and triple co-localizations of the different markers. Data analysis For RNA-seq data analysis, the total baseline counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were calculated with jellyfish109 in both the single nuclei RNA-Seq data (Inspiration4) and poly(A) + RNA-Seq data (Twins Study). These data were filtered for reads containing UUAGGG 6-mers, accounting for reverse complementarity. In these sets of reads, the counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were again calculated, accounting for circular shifts; the normalized count of each k-mer was calculated as its absolute count divided by the total count of all k-mers in the dataset for each k (5 ≤ k ≤ 7). Considering the different experimental designs (Inspiration4: longitudinal cohort; Twins Study: synchronized subject/control; and Mt. Everest climbers: longitudinal cohort), we classified the data into conceptually similar categories: ground (either pre-flight or ground control), space effect (either in-flight or immediately post-flight), and recovery (long-term post-flight); and for the Mount Everest data, pre-ascent (low altitude), ascent (high altitude), and descent (low altitude). The simulated data was classified into microgravity (uG) and Earth gravity (1 G) categories. A Pearson’s correlation matrix of normalized counts of k-mers to the UUAGGG motif across all samples was calculated. Independently for the Inspiration4 data and Twins Study data, and for each motif, Mann–Whitney U tests were performed between space effect and combined non-space (ground and recovery) categories. For simulated data, Mann–Whitney U tests were performed between the uG and 1 G categories, respectively, and for the Mount Everest data, the tests were performed between the pre-ascent, ascent, and descent categories. All resultant p-values were considered together and adjusted with the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (correcting for the false discovery rate, FDR), and sorted by correlation to the UUAGGG motif (Supplementary Data 1, 2, 3). For further analysis and visualization, the ten motifs with the highest correlation (Pearson’s r) to the UUAGGG motif, including itself, were selected in each data set. For the Mann–Whitney U test and the Benjamini–Hochberg correction, the Inspiration4 data was considered in groups at each timepoint, while the Twins Study and the Mount Everest data were grouped per category, owing to the lower number of subjects and samples. Z-scored normalized counts were plotted using seaborn/matplotlib across all categories and timepoints, together with the pairwise adjusted p-values (Figs. 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 4). For in vitro cell culture experiments, all data analyses were performed using Prism 10.0.0 (GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, www.graphpad.com); Supplementary Data 5 reports all comparison statistics. For telomeric RNA-FISH (TERRA) analysis following IR exposure with and without inhibition of transcription (Actinomycin-D treatment), TERRA foci were counted in treated and control (DMSO) groups using Metamorph 7.7 (Fig. 3a). Data represent 2 independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. For EN-T and TRF1-only transfection analysis (FLAG-DAPI immunostaining), data represent 3 independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition); Supplementary Fig. 3. Significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For telomeric DSB induction validation and TERRA colocalization utilizing telomere DNA-FISH and RNA-FISH immunofluorescence (FLAG - γ-H2AX- C-strand telomere; and TRF2-TERRA, FLAG-TERRA, and FLAG-TRF2 -TERRA), the number of multiple colocalization events was counted from the sum of 21 Z-stacks reconstructed three-dimensionally using the deconvolution function on ImageJ (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 4). Quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ and Cell Profiler image analysis software 3.1.5. Data represent three independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test and by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, respectively. For evaluating TERRA distribution (bound vs. unbound), data represent 3 independent experiments (50 cells scored in each condition); Supplementary Fig. 5. Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. For cell cycle and TERRA distributions (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7), data represent five independent experiments (50 cells scored in each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Human participants research Informed consent was obtained from all human research participants.

    "results": "Results Telomeres and TERRA in the space radiation DNA damage response We previously documented telomere length dynamics (changes over time) in astronauts experiencing long-duration spaceflight in low Earth orbit (LEO) onboard the International Space Station (ISS)22,67,68. Contrary to expectation based on in vitro studies and acute radiation exposures69,70, and similar to our results for NASA’s One Year Mission twin astronaut67, which were validated with long-read, single-molecule nanopore sequencing7,22, significantly longer telomeres (in blood) were observed during spaceflight (compared to pre-flight, baseline measures) in two unrelated 6-month mission astronauts. Furthermore, telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to Earth and, overall, average telomere length tended to be shorter after spaceflight than before for all crewmembers in our combined studies. Similarly, for the 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 all civilian crew, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in all 4 crewmembers during the 3-day, high-elevation (590 km) orbital mission71,72. Consistent with our previous studies of astronauts living and working in the space radiation environment22,73, stress-related responses to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, inflammation, and DNA damage were also enriched during the Inspiration4 mission and correlated with telomere length dynamics71,74–76, thus supporting this phenotype as a consistent human response to spaceflight that is thus far independent of mission duration (3 days, 6 months, 1 year). Moreover, our previous cell-by-cell cytogenetic observations of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes during spaceflight (heterogeneous telomere lengths; very long and very short)22, as well as pathway analyses that implicated ALT and recombination-based maintenance of telomeres in two high altitude climbers – who also experienced telomere elongation associated with climbing Mt. Everest68, supported our overall supposition that due to telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative damage, the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance may be transiently activated in normal cells during chronic exposure22. We have reported individual differences in response68, as well as provided support for the mechanistic role of radiation exposure underlying changes in telomere length dynamics and persistent DDRs; specifically, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in a cohort of 15 prostate cancer patients immediately following three months of radiation therapy (IMRT)77,78. Given these results, and the emerging roles of telomeric RNA in maintaining genome stability, which include involvement in DNA damage and cellular stress responses39, we next interrogated whether TERRA might play a role in a low dose/low dose-rate space radiation-induced DDR. Indeed, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data provided evidence of significant increases in the abundance of TERRA transcripts (q-value < 0.05, FDR corrected) during both long and short-duration spaceflight; i.e., for the One-Year mission astronaut (Twins Study)67, and the Inspiration4 crewmembers (Fig. 1). Telomeric repeat sequence variants beyond the canonical 5’-TTAGGG-3’ have been previously reported and confirmed by a variety of approaches, including our telomere long- and short-read DNA sequencing as part of the NASA Twins Study7. Correspondingly, TERRA molecules have been shown to contain frequent variations in the sequence runs of perfect 5’-UUAGGG-3’ repeats79, which were used here to validate TERRA transcripts in both sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry (Illumina) and direct RNA-sequencing (Oxford Nanopore) platforms (short-read bulk RNA-seq, long-read direct RNA, and single-cell RNA-seq). In reads containing the telomeric RNA/TERRA canonical motif, 5’-UUAGGG-3’, the abundance of multiple motif variants increased significantly (Mann–Whitney U test, adjusted p-value < 0.05) compared to baseline (pre-flight and twin ground control samples) in both experiments during and immediately following space flight (Supplementary Data 1, 2); among the top ten correlating variants, Pearson’s r was between 0.87 and 0.94 for the Inspiration4 crewmembers, and at 0.99 for the Twins Study subjects. As such, these motifs displayed concerted significant enrichment during space flight (Twins Study), and immediately post-flight (Inspiration4, R + 1 day), returning to baseline levels over the course of recovery (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Telomeric RNA (TERRA) sequence motif abundance increases in response to spaceflight. Open in a new tab Relative abundances of motifs highly correlating to the canonical TERRA motif 5´-UUAGGG-3´ in RNA-Seq data. a Data from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission for the four civilian astronauts (C001–C004). b Data from the NASA Twins Study for the one-year mission astronaut (TW) and his identical twin ground control (HR). Triangular matrices display pairwise Mann–Whitney U test p-values (FDR-adjusted) for comparisons between the groups, with each box containing a p-value connecting to the groups in the comparison; significance (p < 0.05) is indicated in red (Supplementary Data 1, 2). “L−“ indicates timepoints measured in days prior to launch, “FD” days during spaceflight, and “R+“ in days after return to Earth; prefix “GD” replaces these prefixes for the ground control subject. “Space effect” is a collective term for in-flight timepoints (FD122–334, Twins Study) and immediate post-flight timepoints (R+1, Inspiration4). Simulated microgravity did not result in similar increases in TERRA transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 3).In sharp contrast, ground-based simulated microgravity alone did not lead to an increased abundance of TERRA 5’-UUAGGG-3’ motifs and its variants (Mann–Whitney U p-value = 0.21) (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 3). For these in vitro experiments, and to isolate the particular effect of microgravity, normal human PBMCs from two healthy donors were loaded into a rotating wall vessel (rotary cell culture system) and rotated for 25 h to simulate microgravity, and then RNA-seq was performed on test and control cultures80. Notably, TERRA transcripts associated with simulated microgravity were not significantly increased, and actually even decreased in likelihood. Furthermore, the abundance of TERRA-associated sequence motifs was elevated for climbers while at high altitudes (from 1400 to 5600—6400 m above sea level), and then returned to baseline levels shortly after descent (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 4). Thus, in addition to telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in the ground-based climbers during a 5-day expedition ascending Mt Everest68, TERRA transcripts were significantly enriched in vivo in a high-altitude, higher-radiation environment, independent of microgravity. Fig. 2. Telomeric RNA (TERRA) sequence motif abundance increases in Earth-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest. Open in a new tab Relative abundances of motifs highly correlating to the canonical TERRA motif 5´-UUAGGG-3´ in RNA-Seq data from a longitudinal study of two male climbers of Mt.

Triangular matrices display pairwise Mann–Whitney U test p-values (FDR-adjusted) for comparisons between the groups, with each box containing a p-value connecting to the groups in the comparison; significance (p < 0.05) is indicated in red (Supplementary Data 4). Results demonstrate TERRA overexpression at high altitudes (EB, CII) compared to lower altitudes (CO, NP) in this somewhat similar stressful and high-altitude extreme environment, independent of microgravity. TERRA in the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation-induced DSBs To evaluate whether TERRA might be involved in a general radiation response, another major stressor associated with spaceflight (and high altitudes), cycling human U2OS (ALT) cells with high levels of TERRA were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), a DNA damaging agent and potent inducer of prompt DSBs throughout the genome; specifically, cells were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy), or sham-irradiated (0 Gy), and incubated for 4 h. High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) cell-by-cell image analyses and quantification81 of TERRA signals in individual interphase nuclei following RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) revealed a significant increase in the mean number of TERRA foci/cell in irradiated cells compared to unirradiated controls (p ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3a). To validate and confirm that signals were indeed TERRA, irradiated and unirradiated U2OS cells were treated with RNaseA, which degrades free RNA, and although reduced, TERRA signals remained. Therefore, for all experiments, cells were treated with a combination of RNaseA+H to remove both bound (DNA:RNA hybrids) and unbound (free) TERRA82, which significantly reduced the number of TERRA foci observed (p < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 5). Resistant (remaining) TERRA foci following RNaseA+H treatment likely represent TERRA nested in unwinding RNA G4 structures83. These results provide orthogonal validation that TERRA abundance increases in response to acute IR exposure and genome-wide induction of DSBs. Fig. 3. Transcription-dependent TERRA foci increase in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs. Open in a new tab a Human U2OS cell populations were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy) or sham-irradiated (0 Gy) and TERRA foci/cell quantified using 3-D image analyses following RNA-FISH. Quantification of the mean number of TERRA foci/cell revealed a significant increase post IR exposure (4 h) compared to unirradiated controls (DMSO). Inhibition of transcription via treatment with ActD for 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure prevented the radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci. Error bars are SEM.

Human U2OS cell populations were transiently transfected with EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control), empty vector (EV), or they remained untransfected (UT). Quantification of mean number of colocalized foci/cell: Telomere (TRF2)-TERRA foci represent TERRA at undamaged telomeres (background); Telomere-FLAG foci represent transfected/damaged telomeres without TERRA; and Telomere-FLAG-TERRA foci represent colocalization of TERRA at damaged telomeres. Error bars are SEM. Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ****p < 0.0001, ns not statistically significant. See Supplementary Data 5 for all comparison statistics.To confirm that TERRA induction following in vitro IR exposure was due to increased transcription, consistent with the increased levels of TERRA transcripts observed in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude climb) (Figs. 1 and 2), global transcription was inhibited via treatment with Actinomycin-D (ActD; 10 ug/ml, diluted in DMSO) for 3, 6, 8, and 24 h, and then RNA decay measured using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to assess absolute change in expression of two housekeeping control genes (GAPDH and 18S rRNA), as per previous reports33,34,43,84 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2b). The timepoint for maximum reduction (% expression) was established at 3–8 h ActD treatment (53.2% vs. 39.8% and 37.4% at 8 and 24 h, respectively), therefore U2OS cells were treated with ActD (or DMSO for controls) for 3 and 8 h prior to radiation exposure (2 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and then fixed 4 h later for RNA-FISH. Quantification of TERRA signals (as above) demonstrated that inhibition of transcription prior to IR exposure prevented TERRA induction; i.e., cells treated with ActD did not show a radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci above background levels (Fig. 3a). Taken together, these results support upregulation of TERRA transcription, specifically in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs, as inhibition of transcription following IR exposure prevented induction of increased numbers of TERRA foci. Telomere-specific DSBs induced by the EN-T targeting system Due to the random distribution of DSBs induced by sparsely ionizing radiations, γ-rays would only rarely be expected to directly damage telomeres due to the small fraction of the genome that they occupy. Therefore, to explore the response of TERRA specifically to DSBs that occur within telomeres, we employed the chimeric TRAS1-EN endonuclease fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62 in human U2OS (ALT) cells. We previously demonstrated the utility of this well-characterized system for inducing telomeric DSBs in human normal and cancer cell lines63. Here, populations of cycling U2OS cells were transiently transfected with EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control), or empty vector (EV, transfection control), and then compared to untransfected (UT) negative control populations. To accurately assess DSB induction specifically within telomeres, we first evaluated transfection efficiencies by co-staining for FLAG (to detect EN-T or TRF1-only) and DAPI (to define nuclear DNA/cell periphery) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To eliminate any background signals, only cells with ≥20 FLAG foci/cell were considered positively transfected (~25–30% of the cells) and subsequently scored by the Cell-Profiler software, i.e., all cells scored were transfected (100%). As expected, the mean number of FLAG foci/cell was significantly higher in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to empty vector and untransfected cells (p < 0.001), which represented an ~4-fold increase (Supplementary Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 5). Additionally, the mean number of FLAG foci/cell for EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations did not significantly differ, suggesting similar levels of transfection for EN-T and TRF1-only. To validate EN-T induction of telomere-specific DSBs, positively-transfected U2OS cells (FLAG+) were subjected to native (non-denaturing) telomere FISH (to detect resected single-stranded telomeric DNA) together with γ-H2AX immunofluorescence (to detect DNA DSBs)85, which served to identify telomere-specific DSBs as evidenced by triple co-localization of FLAG, γ-H2AX, and telomere (TTAGGG) foci (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both EN-T and TRF1-only co-localized to telomeres and induced telomeric DSBs to similar levels (FLAG-γH2AX-telomere co-localized foci), confirming EN-T induction of targeted telomeric DSBs. That TRF1-only also recruited γ-H2AX to telomeric damage sites is consistent with previous reports86,87 and the recent demonstration that overexpression of wild-type TRF1, and not mutated TRF1, in U2OS ALT cells resulted in a 3-fold increase in telomeric γ-H2AX foci at 48hr88. Telomeric DSBs were not observed in cells transfected with empty vector or in untransfected populations (FLAG-), and as expected there was no significant effect of RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5). When the data was evaluated as percent co-localization (Supplementary Fig. 4b), FLAG-γH2AX-telomere foci co-localized at most telomeres in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells (>80% were damaged), and all detectable γ-H2AX was localized to telomeres. Thus, our approach utilizing the EN-T system facilitated evaluation of telomeric DNA damage/DSBs only in transfected cells (inclusion of non-transfected cells was avoided), and results confirmed the efficiency of EN-T and TRF1-only in inducing DSBs specifically at telomeres in U2OS ALT cells. TERRA response and recruitment to telomeric DSB sites To test the hypothesis that TERRA may respond specifically to telomeric DSB damage sites, TERRA foci were quantified using cell-by-cell 3-D image analysis of RNA-FISH in transfected and untransfected U2OS cell populations. To evaluate and visualize TERRA response to telomeric DSB damage sites, we quantified triple co-localization of FLAG, TERRA, and telomere (TRF2) foci (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Significant increases in the mean number of TERRA foci co-localized at telomeric DSB sites (p < 0.0001) were observed in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to empty vector and untransfected controls; RNaseA+H treatment removed TERRA signal from all populations (Supplementary Data 5). Furthermore, there was a corresponding decrease in the mean number of undamaged telomeres bound by TERRA in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells compared to the steady-state/background levels of undamaged telomeres in empty vector and untransfected populations (Telomere-TERRA co-localized foci). These results provide direct evidence of significantly increased levels of hybridized TERRA specifically at telomeric DSB damage sites, consistent with the transcription-dependent nature of elevated TERRA foci and formation of TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in response to broken telomeres; i.e., TERRA binds extensive tracks of resected 5’ single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA at DSB break sites63. We further examined TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid dynamics by estimating percentages of bound (hybridized) and unbound (free) TERRA (Supplementary Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 5). Total TERRA foci in positively transfected EN-T and TRF1-only cells (>20 FLAG foci) with damaged telomeres (FLAG-TERRA-TRF2 foci) were compared to empty vector and untransfected populations with few or no damaged telomeres (TERRA-TRF2 foci). Free TERRA was determined by subtracting hybridized from total TERRA. A striking shift in TERRA distribution occurred in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to the controls (empty vector and untransfected). EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells with damaged telomeres had ~90% of TERRA bound to telomeres, and only ~10% of the total TERRA was free. In control populations, the opposite trend was observed; only ~30% of TERRA was bound to telomeres, while ~70% was free, similar to previous reports in telomerase positive cells36,44. Results indicate that in contrast to typically stable localization of TERRA at telomeres in U2OS ALT cells51, upon induction of telomeric DSBs free TERRA is recruited to damage sites, as the fraction of bound TERRA significantly increased while free TERRA dramatically decreased, reflective of a potentially rapid and robust response to telomeric DSBs. Taken together, these findings suggest that in addition to newly transcribed, nascent TERRA being retained at extensively resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA at telomeric DSB damage sites, readily-available, free TERRA is also recruited to telomeric DSB sites, with both forming protective telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids41,63. TERRA accumulates at telomeric-DSBs in G2 ALT cells To further investigate TERRA in the DDR to telomeric DSBs, and considering that U2OS cells experience a permissive G1 checkpoint89, and that both RAD51 and RAD52 have been implicated in TERRA interactions at telomeres40,90, we hypothesized a requisite cell-cycle dependent component of TERRA’s role at telomeric DSBs if involved in facilitating recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. As per our previous report63, a stably transfected U2OS cell line expressing Geminin protein fused to Green Fluorescence Protein (Geminin-GFP)91 was created to positively identify individual interphase nuclei in G2-phase; absence of Geminin-GFP signals in each negative (unlabeled) cell represented a cell in G1-phase. To identify nuclei in S-phase, cells were pulse-labeled with EdU for 30 min. Thus, cells positive for Germinin-GFP were in G2, cells positive for EdU were in S, and cells negative for both markers were in G1 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Cell cycle distributions were thereby determined in transfected populations and compared to untransfected controls, in which there was no significant difference between the mean number or percent of cells in G1 and G2 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In contrast, transiently transfected EN-T, TRF1-only, and empty vector cells accumulated in G2-phase, consistent with a DNA damage-induced G2 block, irrespective of whether DNA damage was telomere-specific DSBs (EN-T, TRF1-only; Fig. 3b) or other more general DNA damage related to the cellular stress and toxicity of transfection (empty vector)92. Indeed, there were significantly more cells in G2 compared to G1 in each of the transfected populations (p < 0.005; Supplementary Data 5), as well as a corresponding decrease of cells in G1. Consistent with expectation, cell cycle distributions were not significantly influenced by RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5). Next, we quantified TERRA abundance throughout the cell cycle, which mirrored the cell cycle distributions in that there was no significant difference between the mean number of TERRA foci in G1 and G2 cells in untransfected control populations, while in transfected populations TERRA foci increased in G2 and correspondingly decreased in G1 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Significant increases in the mean number of TERRA foci in G2 compared to G1-phase occurred in each of the transfected populations (p < 0.0001; Supplementary Data 5). These results further support free TERRA being recruited to telomere-specific DSBs (EN-T, TRF1-only) and demonstrate TERRA accumulation in G2-phase, concomitant with a DNA damage-induced G2 block (Supplementary Fig. 6b). TERRA was also elevated in response to the cellular stress of transfection (empty vector), but these TERRA foci were not associated with telomeric DSBs since they did not colocalize with γ-H2AX at telomeres (Fig. 3b), a finding consistent with previous reports demonstrating crosstalk between cellular stress and TERRA induction [reviewed in ref. 39]. Lastly, and as expected, TERRA foci were eliminated by RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5).",
    "discussion": "Discussion In light of TERRA’s emerging roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses39, we speculated that TERRA might play a role in ionizing radiation and/or telomeric DDRs. To test this, we investigated telomeric RNA, or TERRA, levels in astronauts experiencing the low dose/low dose-rate space radiation environment and in ground-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest (normal human blood in vivo), as well as in normal human PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity, and in human U2OS (ALT) cells utilizing in vitro radiation exposures and the chimeric EN-T telomeric DSB targeting system62,63,68. As part of the NASA Twins Study, we pioneered a variety of spaceflight-specific approaches for overcoming the unique challenges associated with obtaining astronaut/human in vivo samples for modern “omics”-based and molecular analyses. Here, transcriptomics revealed an increased abundance of TERRA transcripts in bulk cDNA, single-cell cDNA, and direct RNAseq data, during both long (One Year) and short-duration (3-day) spaceflight as compared to pre-flight ground controls. The presence of variants of the canonical TERRA motif (5’-UUAGGG-3’) in the telomeric RNA likely represent the contribution of previously reported non-canonical telomeric motifs7, and motifs with high levels of correlation to 5’-UUAGGG-3’ served as proxies for detection of TERRA. This was particularly evident in the case of our Twins Study data, where the top ten motifs correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson’s r = 0.99). We note that the counts of shorter k-mers may be partially contributed to by the counts of longer k-mers (such as UUAGGG explaining UUAGG). However, these motifs are often subsets of sequence, and the results are significant per-motif or across all sequences. The lower values of r in the Inspiration4 data may be the result of higher levels of RNA degradation or the shorter mission duration – nevertheless, these data also showed that all top motifs were significantly enriched following spaceflight, consistent with the higher levels of TERRA detected by the plurality of methods employed. It is also worth noting the much higher radiation dose-rate for the Inspiration4 high-elevation orbital mission (1.57 mSv/day) vs. the One Year Mission in LEO for the NASA Twins Study (0.42 mSv/day), potentially suggestive of a dose response in terms of TERRA expression71,93, and an important avenue of investigation for future missions. Mechanistically insightful was the observation that simulated microgravity alone did not induce similar increases in TERRA abundance. Although terrestrial analogs like rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines may not precisely replicate microgravity conditions in space, they are often used for such purposes as a proxy94, since they are the only reasonable or available option, and they facilitate testing the isolated effect of this single stressor. Our finding of elevated abundance of TERRA transcripts in the Earth-bound high-altitude climbers of Mt Everest in vivo, who also experienced telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in this somewhat similar stressful and higher-radiation environment68, further supports this conclusion. Also relevant in this regard is that radiation dose rates from more damaging cosmic radiations increase with altitude, and doses per Everest expedition are in the range of 1 mSv [International Radiation Protection Association]. Given the intriguing human in vivo evidence, we pursued in vitro studies to characterize the response and investigate whether TERRA might be involved in a general DNA damage response to IR-induced DSBs. Human U2OS ALT cells were utilized due to their high levels of TERRA, as well as the indications of ALT/ALT-like activity observed during spaceflight and the high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest68,95. Transcription-dependent increases in the numbers of TERRA foci were observed in irradiated populations (compared to non-irradiated controls), consistent with previous reports of upregulation of TERRA following treatment with the chemotherapeutic and radiomimetic drug bleomycin96, as well as with increased TERRA transcription upon treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces DSBs97. Because all of these DNA damaging agents induce DSBs randomly throughout the genome, we next queried whether TERRA might be responding specifically to DSBs within telomeres themselves. To address this possibility, we employed the EN-T targeting system due to its effective induction of telomere-specific DSBs as opposed to single-strand damage, such as that induced by reactive oxygen species62,90, an important consideration since oxidative stress is also associated with IR exposure and has been shown to increase TERRA levels in normal cells98,99. Telomere-specific DSBs induced by EN-T and TRF1-only (positive control in U2OS ALT cells) were confirmed via triple co-localization of FLAG-γH2AX-telomere foci, events not observed with empty-vector transfected or untransfected populations. Importantly, hybridized TERRA was directly visualized specifically at telomeric DSB damage sites, as evidenced by triple co-localization of FLAG-TERRA-TRF2 foci. Furthermore, a striking redistribution of abundant and “free” (unbound) TERRA to hybridized (bound) TERRA occurred in response to induction of telomere-specific DSBs, supportive evidence of TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation at break sites. Bearing in mind that U2OS cells experience a defective G1 checkpoint due to truncated WIP1 (wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1) and p16 deficiency (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor)89, and further that the HR proteins RAD51 and RAD52 have been shown to be required for TERRA interactions at telomeres40,88, we employed a Geminin-GFP/EdU based strategy as per our previous63 to determine cell cycle profiles of interphase nuclei experiencing telomeric DSBs. Positively transfected EN-T and TRF1-only cells accumulated in G2-phase, consistent with a DNA damage/telomeric DSB-induced G2 block. U2OS cell populations transfected with empty vector also accumulated in G2, reflective of transfection-induced toxicity, cellular stress, and/or more general DNA damage92. Notably, cell cycle distributions of TERRA foci showed parallel dynamics, in that concomitant enrichment of TERRA foci in G2 was observed in all three transfected populations. Since TERRA responded not only to telomere-specific DNA/DSB damage (EN-T, TRF1-only), but also to the cellular stress of transfection (empty vector), our data is consistent with previous reports demonstrating crosstalk between cellular stress and TERRA induction [reviewed in ref. 39]. Results are also consistent with TERRA foci in empty vector populations not being associated with telomere-specific DSBs/broken telomeres because they did not colocalize with γ-H2AX at telomeres. Telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative stress-related base damage likely contributes to TERRA’s response, whether associated with IR or cellular stress, and especially when exposure is chronic in nature68. Taken together, these results support a telomere-specific DDR in the space radiation environment whereby TERRA transcription is triggered upon telomeric damage resulting from chronic oxidative stress and on-going damage to telomeres, which includes DSB induction and “broken” telomeres93. Nascent TERRA is then retained at, and readily-available free (unbound) TERRA is recruited to telomeric DSB damage sites, where it binds extensive tracks of resected single-stranded 5’ C-rich telomeric DNA63. Consistent with recent findings100, as well as our direct visualization of hybridized TERRA at telomeric DSB damage sites, such recruitment and redistribution of TERRA results in protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids that serve to prevent further resection at damaged/broken telomeres, as well as facilitate RNA-templated repair101,102 via homologous recombination-dependent elongation in G2 as a means of restoring functional telomeres. In addition to providing a template for HR-directed repair of broken telomeres in cycling cells, and thereby potentially facilitating transient induction of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes in normal cells and contributing to changes in telomere length dynamics (very long and very short telomeres), we speculate that TERRA may also facilitate such repair, e.g., via increased mobility and/or serving as a scaffold for recruitment of required repair machinery103. The relevance of these findings is further highlighted by our recent demonstration that telomere dysfunction can stimulate translation of TERRA into two novel telomeric dipeptide repeat signaling proteins with the potential of inducing genomic instability and inflammation, intriguing results that also challenge the presumed “non-coding” nature of TERRA35,104. Thus, results offer important mechanistic insight that can be integrated into future studies with the ultimate goal of informing and improving aerospace precision medicine approaches for astronauts. Results also have important implications for adverse health effects related to persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress – both on the off the planet; e.g., systemic chronic inflammatory responses105, advancing age106, and low dose, low dose-rate environmental or occupational radiation exposures68. Elevated radiation and oxidative stress were associated with both long- and short-duration spaceflight and high-altitude climbing, and chronic exposure is capable of transiently activating the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance via recombination in normal human cells, evidence of which was observed during spaceflight, as well as in the somewhat similar high-altitude extreme environment of climbing Mt. Everest22,68. Moreover, and consistent with recent evidence that increased TERRA transcription and associated ALT-like mechanisms pose a threat to telomere integrity so must be properly controlled in normal cells107, our results also support the possibility of targeting telomeric RNA/TERRA-mediated protection and repair of damaged telomeres associated with high dose radiation therapy78 as a promising therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive cancers.",

Copyright notice ID: 11167063 PMID: 38862827 Abstract Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors. Subject terms: Genetics, Molecular biology Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) data reveal significantly increased telomeric RNA, or TERRA, in response to spaceflight and radiation exposure (compared to baseline and ground control samples).Introduction Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein “caps” at the natural ends of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeres face two major challenges as a result of their physical location: the inability to replicate to the very end of linear DNA molecules (the end replication problem)1,2; and circumventing activation of inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) (the end protection problem)3,4. Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of highly conserved repetitive G-rich sequence (5’-TTAGGG/CCCTAA-3’)5–7, which in humans range in length from ~5 to 15 kb and end in 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs of ~30–500 nucleotides8,9. The 3’ single-stranded telomeric overhang serves as the substrate for telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto newly synthesized telomeres10. Telomeric 3’ overhangs also facilitate formation of protective terminal structural features termed t-loops11,12. Telomeres are dynamic structures associated with a myriad of telomere-specific and nonspecific proteins, six of which comprise the shelterin complex and include the telomere-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, which contributes to regulation of telomerase activity, t-loop formation, and protection of chromosome ends8,13–15. Normal human somatic cells have very low levels of telomerase activity, and thus telomeres shorten with continued cell division, as well as with oxidative stress and a variety of lifestyle factors, including chronic stressors and environmental exposures16–22. Telomere shortening is a key molecular driver of aging and determinant of age-related degenerative pathologies, including dementias, cardiovascular disease, and cancer23–25. Telomerase activity is sufficient to maintain telomere length only in highly proliferative populations like germ-line and stem cells, and the vast majority of cancers26. The remaining ~10–15% of human cancers maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent, recombination- mediated Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway27–29. ALT tumors display a number of distinguishing features, including heterogeneous telomere lengths, increased frequencies of telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ETCRs)30–32. Due to their repetitive and heterochromatic nature, telomeres were long regarded as silent, rather unremarkable regions of the genome. Therefore, discovery of TElomere Repeat-containing RNA, or TERRA, propelled the field into new areas of research and potential mechanisms of telomere maintenance33,34. TERRA, a presumed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) until recently35, ranges in length from ~ one hundred to over 9000 nucleotides and is transcribed from CpG islands within subtelomeric regions towards chromosomal termini by RNA Pol II, predominantly using the C-rich leading-strand as a template and producing 5’-UUAGGG-3’ transcripts33,36,37. TERRA is thought to accumulate preferentially at short telomeres, where it contributes to end-capping structure and function via regulation of telomere length and maintenance of genome stability38–40. TERRA can also indirectly associate with telomeres via shelterin proteins41,42, as well as interact with an array of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1)43,44. In telomerase-positive human cells, TERRA is primarily chromatin-associated (bound) and not polyadenylated (polyA-), while “free” (unbound) TERRA is polyadenylated at its 3’-end (polyA+) and represents ~7% of total TERRA33,36. TERRA can associate with telomeric DNA to generate classic R-loops, which are formed by the annealing of nascent TERRA “in-cis” to the complementary C-rich telomere strand when it fails to be released and remains bound as a 3-stranded structure, with the G-rich telomere strand displaced and forming G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. There is also evidence that 3-stranded telomeric R-loops can be formed by a recombinational-like mechanism, in which TERRA invades a telomeric duplex “in-trans”45. In either case, and similar to t-loops46, TERRA transcription and telomeric R-loops represent sources of replication stress and DNA damage specifically within telomeres47,48. A different TERRA-based structure occurs via the direct binding of TERRA to a C-rich single-stranded telomere tract forming a 2-stranded TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid. Telomeric R-loops and TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids promote homology-directed repair at telomeres and are common in ALT cells, likely due to an abundance of TERRA38. One of the hallmarks of ALT is loss of function of the chromatin remodeling complex ATRX/DAXX [α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and its physical partner death domain-associated protein (DAXX)]49, which results in decompaction of telomeric chromatin50, thereby facilitating increased transcription and elevated levels of TERRA in ALT cells compared to normal cells or telomerase positive tumors with functional ATRX/DAXX51,52. Indeed, significantly increased frequencies of telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids were found in human U2OS ALT (osteosarcoma) cells compared to HeLa telomerase positive (cervical carcinoma) cells. Furthermore, removal of telomere-bound TERRA in ALT cells via overexpression of the endogenous RNA endonuclease RnaseH1 resulted in telomere shortening. Together, these results support critical roles for TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in telomere protection and recombination-mediated elongation in ALT cells38. Interestingly, TERRA has also been implicated in telomere mobility, a capability that would facilitate the physical telomere-telomere interaction required for recombination events to occur38,53. Such an “end-view” of TERRA is consistent with strict inhibition of DDRs at telomeres, which prevents spurious end-joining and genomic instability54,55, but also renders telomeres refractory to repair when damage does occur within and/or near telomeric regions; e.g., telomeric regions are especially susceptible to oxidative damage due to their G-rich makeup56,57. Telomere site-specific endonucleases have been developed and employed to address the question of how, and even whether, double-strand breaks (DSBs) within telomeres are repaired58–60. We previously utilized transient transfection of the well-characterized endonuclease TRAS1-EN fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62 in human BJ1-hTERT apparently normal fibroblasts, as well as in EJ-30 telomerase positive and U2OS (ALT) cancer cells, to evaluate telomeric DSBs specifically in G1-phase of the cell cycle63. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) provided a valuable biomarker of broken telomeres, as they represent co-localization of the well-established DSB marker gamma (γ)-H2AX at telomeres64. Importantly, induction of telomere-specific DSBs resulted in extensive tracks of resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA in all cell lines (independent of telomerase status), a previously proposed biomarker of the recombination dependent ALT pathway65,66. We posited that such highly reactive and exposed DNA “ends” were protected by binding complementary TERRA and forming telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids, so that they might persist into S/G2 for recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. Here, to better understand the role of telomeric RNA in the telomeric DDR, we investigated TERRA associated with ionizing radiation- and telomere specific-induced damage in normal human blood in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest), and in human U2OS (ALT) cells in vitro.Results Telomeres and TERRA in the space radiation DNA damage response We previously documented telomere length dynamics (changes over time) in astronauts experiencing long-duration spaceflight in low Earth orbit (LEO) onboard the International Space Station (ISS)22,67,68. Contrary to expectation based on in vitro studies and acute radiation exposures69,70, and similar to our results for NASA’s One Year Mission twin astronaut67, which were validated with long-read, single-molecule nanopore sequencing7,22, significantly longer telomeres (in blood) were observed during spaceflight (compared to pre-flight, baseline measures) in two unrelated 6-month mission astronauts. Furthermore, telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to Earth and, overall, average telomere length tended to be shorter after spaceflight than before for all crewmembers in our combined studies. Similarly, for the 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 all civilian crew, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in all 4 crewmembers during the 3-day, high-elevation (590 km) orbital mission71,72. Consistent with our previous studies of astronauts living and working in the space radiation environment22,73, stress-related responses to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, inflammation, and DNA damage were also enriched during the Inspiration4 mission and correlated with telomere length dynamics71,74–76, thus supporting this phenotype as a consistent human response to spaceflight that is thus far independent of mission duration (3 days, 6 months, 1 year). Moreover, our previous cell-by-cell cytogenetic observations of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes during spaceflight (heterogeneous telomere lengths; very long and very short)22, as well as pathway analyses that implicated ALT and recombination-based maintenance of telomeres in two high altitude climbers – who also experienced telomere elongation associated with climbing Mt. Everest68, supported our overall supposition that due to telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative damage, the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance may be transiently activated in normal cells during chronic exposure22. We have reported individual differences in response68, as well as provided support for the mechanistic role of radiation exposure underlying changes in telomere length dynamics and persistent DDRs; specifically, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in a cohort of 15 prostate cancer patients immediately following three months of radiation therapy (IMRT)77,78. Given these results, and the emerging roles of telomeric RNA in maintaining genome stability, which include involvement in DNA damage and cellular stress responses39, we next interrogated whether TERRA might play a role in a low dose/low dose-rate space radiation-induced DDR. Indeed, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data provided evidence of significant increases in the abundance of TERRA transcripts (q-value < 0.05, FDR corrected) during both long and short-duration spaceflight; i.e., for the One-Year mission astronaut (Twins Study)67, and the Inspiration4 crewmembers (Fig. 1). Telomeric repeat sequence variants beyond the canonical 5’-TTAGGG-3’ have been previously reported and confirmed by a variety of approaches, including our telomere long- and short-read DNA sequencing as part of the NASA Twins Study7. Correspondingly, TERRA molecules have been shown to contain frequent variations in the sequence runs of perfect 5’-UUAGGG-3’ repeats79, which were used here to validate TERRA transcripts in both sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry (Illumina) and direct RNA-sequencing (Oxford Nanopore) platforms (short-read bulk RNA-seq, long-read direct RNA, and single-cell RNA-seq). In reads containing the telomeric RNA/TERRA canonical motif, 5’-UUAGGG-3’, the abundance of multiple motif variants increased significantly (Mann–Whitney U test, adjusted p-value < 0.05) compared to baseline (pre-flight and twin ground control samples) in both experiments during and immediately following space flight (Supplementary Data 1, 2); among the top ten correlating variants, Pearson’s r was between 0.87 and 0.94 for the Inspiration4 crewmembers, and at 0.99 for the Twins Study subjects. As such, these motifs displayed concerted significant enrichment during space flight (Twins Study), and immediately post-flight (Inspiration4, R + 1 day), returning to baseline levels over the course of recovery (Fig. 1).

Simulated microgravity did not result in similar increases in TERRA transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 3).In sharp contrast, ground-based simulated microgravity alone did not lead to an increased abundance of TERRA 5’-UUAGGG-3’ motifs and its variants (Mann–Whitney U p-value = 0.21) (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 3). For these in vitro experiments, and to isolate the particular effect of microgravity, normal human PBMCs from two healthy donors were loaded into a rotating wall vessel (rotary cell culture system) and rotated for 25 h to simulate microgravity, and then RNA-seq was performed on test and control cultures80. Notably, TERRA transcripts associated with simulated microgravity were not significantly increased, and actually even decreased in likelihood. Furthermore, the abundance of TERRA-associated sequence motifs was elevated for climbers while at high altitudes (from 1400 to 5600—6400 m above sea level), and then returned to baseline levels shortly after descent (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 4). Thus, in addition to telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in the ground-based climbers during a 5-day expedition ascending Mt Everest68, TERRA transcripts were significantly enriched in vivo in a high-altitude, higher-radiation environment, independent of microgravity.

Open in a new tab Relative abundances of motifs highly correlating to the canonical TERRA motif 5´-UUAGGG-3´ in RNA-Seq data from a longitudinal study of two male climbers of Mt.

Triangular matrices display pairwise Mann–Whitney U test p-values (FDR-adjusted) for comparisons between the groups, with each box containing a p-value connecting to the groups in the comparison; significance (p < 0.05) is indicated in red (Supplementary Data 4). Results demonstrate TERRA overexpression at high altitudes (EB, CII) compared to lower altitudes (CO, NP) in this somewhat similar stressful and high-altitude extreme environment, independent of microgravity.TERRA in the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation-induced DSBs To evaluate whether TERRA might be involved in a general radiation response, another major stressor associated with spaceflight (and high altitudes), cycling human U2OS (ALT) cells with high levels of TERRA were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), a DNA damaging agent and potent inducer of prompt DSBs throughout the genome; specifically, cells were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy), or sham-irradiated (0 Gy), and incubated for 4 h. High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) cell-by-cell image analyses and quantification81 of TERRA signals in individual interphase nuclei following RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) revealed a significant increase in the mean number of TERRA foci/cell in irradiated cells compared to unirradiated controls (p ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3a). To validate and confirm that signals were indeed TERRA, irradiated and unirradiated U2OS cells were treated with RNaseA, which degrades free RNA, and although reduced, TERRA signals remained. Therefore, for all experiments, cells were treated with a combination of RNaseA+H to remove both bound (DNA:RNA hybrids) and unbound (free) TERRA82, which significantly reduced the number of TERRA foci observed (p < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 5). Resistant (remaining) TERRA foci following RNaseA+H treatment likely represent TERRA nested in unwinding RNA G4 structures83. These results provide orthogonal validation that TERRA abundance increases in response to acute IR exposure and genome-wide induction of DSBs. Fig. 3. Transcription-dependent TERRA foci increase in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs. Open in a new tab a Human U2OS cell populations were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy) or sham-irradiated (0 Gy) and TERRA foci/cell quantified using 3-D image analyses following RNA-FISH. Quantification of the mean number of TERRA foci/cell revealed a significant increase post IR exposure (4 h) compared to unirradiated controls (DMSO). Inhibition of transcription via treatment with ActD for 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure prevented the radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci. Error bars are SEM. Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. ****p < 0.0001. b TERRA colocalizes at telomere-specific DSBs.

Quantification of mean number of colocalized foci/cell: Telomere (TRF2)-TERRA foci represent TERRA at undamaged telomeres (background); Telomere-FLAG foci represent transfected/damaged telomeres without TERRA; and Telomere-FLAG-TERRA foci represent colocalization of TERRA at damaged telomeres. Error bars are SEM. Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ****p < 0.0001, ns not statistically significant. See Supplementary Data 5 for all comparison statistics.To confirm that TERRA induction following in vitro IR exposure was due to increased transcription, consistent with the increased levels of TERRA transcripts observed in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude climb) (Figs. 1 and 2), global transcription was inhibited via treatment with Actinomycin-D (ActD; 10 ug/ml, diluted in DMSO) for 3, 6, 8, and 24 h, and then RNA decay measured using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to assess absolute change in expression of two housekeeping control genes (GAPDH and 18S rRNA), as per previous reports33,34,43,84 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2b). The timepoint for maximum reduction (% expression) was established at 3–8 h ActD treatment (53.2% vs. 39.8% and 37.4% at 8 and 24 h, respectively), therefore U2OS cells were treated with ActD (or DMSO for controls) for 3 and 8 h prior to radiation exposure (2 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and then fixed 4 h later for RNA-FISH. Quantification of TERRA signals (as above) demonstrated that inhibition of transcription prior to IR exposure prevented TERRA induction; i.e., cells treated with ActD did not show a radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci above background levels (Fig. 3a). Taken together, these results support upregulation of TERRA transcription, specifically in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs, as inhibition of transcription following IR exposure prevented induction of increased numbers of TERRA foci.Telomere-specific DSBs induced by the EN-T targeting system Due to the random distribution of DSBs induced by sparsely ionizing radiations, γ-rays would only rarely be expected to directly damage telomeres due to the small fraction of the genome that they occupy. Therefore, to explore the response of TERRA specifically to DSBs that occur within telomeres, we employed the chimeric TRAS1-EN endonuclease fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62 in human U2OS (ALT) cells. We previously demonstrated the utility of this well-characterized system for inducing telomeric DSBs in human normal and cancer cell lines63. Here, populations of cycling U2OS cells were transiently transfected with EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control), or empty vector (EV, transfection control), and then compared to untransfected (UT) negative control populations. To accurately assess DSB induction specifically within telomeres, we first evaluated transfection efficiencies by co-staining for FLAG (to detect EN-T or TRF1-only) and DAPI (to define nuclear DNA/cell periphery) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To eliminate any background signals, only cells with ≥20 FLAG foci/cell were considered positively transfected (~25–30% of the cells) and subsequently scored by the Cell-Profiler software, i.e., all cells scored were transfected (100%). As expected, the mean number of FLAG foci/cell was significantly higher in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to empty vector and untransfected cells (p < 0.001), which represented an ~4-fold increase (Supplementary Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 5). Additionally, the mean number of FLAG foci/cell for EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations did not significantly differ, suggesting similar levels of transfection for EN-T and TRF1-only. To validate EN-T induction of telomere-specific DSBs, positively-transfected U2OS cells (FLAG+) were subjected to native (non-denaturing) telomere FISH (to detect resected single-stranded telomeric DNA) together with γ-H2AX immunofluorescence (to detect DNA DSBs)85, which served to identify telomere-specific DSBs as evidenced by triple co-localization of FLAG, γ-H2AX, and telomere (TTAGGG) foci (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both EN-T and TRF1-only co-localized to telomeres and induced telomeric DSBs to similar levels (FLAG-γH2AX-telomere co-localized foci), confirming EN-T induction of targeted telomeric DSBs. That TRF1-only also recruited γ-H2AX to telomeric damage sites is consistent with previous reports86,87 and the recent demonstration that overexpression of wild-type TRF1, and not mutated TRF1, in U2OS ALT cells resulted in a 3-fold increase in telomeric γ-H2AX foci at 48hr88. Telomeric DSBs were not observed in cells transfected with empty vector or in untransfected populations (FLAG-), and as expected there was no significant effect of RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5). When the data was evaluated as percent co-localization (Supplementary Fig. 4b), FLAG-γH2AX-telomere foci co-localized at most telomeres in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells (>80% were damaged), and all detectable γ-H2AX was localized to telomeres. Thus, our approach utilizing the EN-T system facilitated evaluation of telomeric DNA damage/DSBs only in transfected cells (inclusion of non-transfected cells was avoided), and results confirmed the efficiency of EN-T and TRF1-only in inducing DSBs specifically at telomeres in U2OS ALT cells.TERRA response and recruitment to telomeric DSB sites To test the hypothesis that TERRA may respond specifically to telomeric DSB damage sites, TERRA foci were quantified using cell-by-cell 3-D image analysis of RNA-FISH in transfected and untransfected U2OS cell populations. To evaluate and visualize TERRA response to telomeric DSB damage sites, we quantified triple co-localization of FLAG, TERRA, and telomere (TRF2) foci (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Significant increases in the mean number of TERRA foci co-localized at telomeric DSB sites (p < 0.0001) were observed in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to empty vector and untransfected controls; RNaseA+H treatment removed TERRA signal from all populations (Supplementary Data 5). Furthermore, there was a corresponding decrease in the mean number of undamaged telomeres bound by TERRA in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells compared to the steady-state/background levels of undamaged telomeres in empty vector and untransfected populations (Telomere-TERRA co-localized foci). These results provide direct evidence of significantly increased levels of hybridized TERRA specifically at telomeric DSB damage sites, consistent with the transcription-dependent nature of elevated TERRA foci and formation of TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in response to broken telomeres; i.e., TERRA binds extensive tracks of resected 5’ single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA at DSB break sites63. We further examined TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid dynamics by estimating percentages of bound (hybridized) and unbound (free) TERRA (Supplementary Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 5). Total TERRA foci in positively transfected EN-T and TRF1-only cells (>20 FLAG foci) with damaged telomeres (FLAG-TERRA-TRF2 foci) were compared to empty vector and untransfected populations with few or no damaged telomeres (TERRA-TRF2 foci). Free TERRA was determined by subtracting hybridized from total TERRA. A striking shift in TERRA distribution occurred in EN-T and TRF1-only transfected populations compared to the controls (empty vector and untransfected). EN-T and TRF1-only transfected cells with damaged telomeres had ~90% of TERRA bound to telomeres, and only ~10% of the total TERRA was free. In control populations, the opposite trend was observed; only ~30% of TERRA was bound to telomeres, while ~70% was free, similar to previous reports in telomerase positive cells36,44. Results indicate that in contrast to typically stable localization of TERRA at telomeres in U2OS ALT cells51, upon induction of telomeric DSBs free TERRA is recruited to damage sites, as the fraction of bound TERRA significantly increased while free TERRA dramatically decreased, reflective of a potentially rapid and robust response to telomeric DSBs. Taken together, these findings suggest that in addition to newly transcribed, nascent TERRA being retained at extensively resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA at telomeric DSB damage sites, readily-available, free TERRA is also recruited to telomeric DSB sites, with both forming protective telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids41,63.TERRA accumulates at telomeric-DSBs in G2 ALT cells To further investigate TERRA in the DDR to telomeric DSBs, and considering that U2OS cells experience a permissive G1 checkpoint89, and that both RAD51 and RAD52 have been implicated in TERRA interactions at telomeres40,90, we hypothesized a requisite cell-cycle dependent component of TERRA’s role at telomeric DSBs if involved in facilitating recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. As per our previous report63, a stably transfected U2OS cell line expressing Geminin protein fused to Green Fluorescence Protein (Geminin-GFP)91 was created to positively identify individual interphase nuclei in G2-phase; absence of Geminin-GFP signals in each negative (unlabeled) cell represented a cell in G1-phase. To identify nuclei in S-phase, cells were pulse-labeled with EdU for 30 min. Thus, cells positive for Germinin-GFP were in G2, cells positive for EdU were in S, and cells negative for both markers were in G1 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Cell cycle distributions were thereby determined in transfected populations and compared to untransfected controls, in which there was no significant difference between the mean number or percent of cells in G1 and G2 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In contrast, transiently transfected EN-T, TRF1-only, and empty vector cells accumulated in G2-phase, consistent with a DNA damage-induced G2 block, irrespective of whether DNA damage was telomere-specific DSBs (EN-T, TRF1-only; Fig. 3b) or other more general DNA damage related to the cellular stress and toxicity of transfection (empty vector)92. Indeed, there were significantly more cells in G2 compared to G1 in each of the transfected populations (p < 0.005; Supplementary Data 5), as well as a corresponding decrease of cells in G1. Consistent with expectation, cell cycle distributions were not significantly influenced by RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5). Next, we quantified TERRA abundance throughout the cell cycle, which mirrored the cell cycle distributions in that there was no significant difference between the mean number of TERRA foci in G1 and G2 cells in untransfected control populations, while in transfected populations TERRA foci increased in G2 and correspondingly decreased in G1 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Significant increases in the mean number of TERRA foci in G2 compared to G1-phase occurred in each of the transfected populations (p < 0.0001; Supplementary Data 5). These results further support free TERRA being recruited to telomere-specific DSBs (EN-T, TRF1-only) and demonstrate TERRA accumulation in G2-phase, concomitant with a DNA damage-induced G2 block (Supplementary Fig. 6b). TERRA was also elevated in response to the cellular stress of transfection (empty vector), but these TERRA foci were not associated with telomeric DSBs since they did not colocalize with γ-H2AX at telomeres (Fig. 3b), a finding consistent with previous reports demonstrating crosstalk between cellular stress and TERRA induction [reviewed in ref. 39]. Lastly, and as expected, TERRA foci were eliminated by RNaseA+H treatment (Supplementary Data 5).Discussion In light of TERRA’s emerging roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses39, we speculated that TERRA might play a role in ionizing radiation and/or telomeric DDRs. To test this, we investigated telomeric RNA, or TERRA, levels in astronauts experiencing the low dose/low dose-rate space radiation environment and in ground-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest (normal human blood in vivo), as well as in normal human PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity, and in human U2OS (ALT) cells utilizing in vitro radiation exposures and the chimeric EN-T telomeric DSB targeting system62,63,68. As part of the NASA Twins Study, we pioneered a variety of spaceflight-specific approaches for overcoming the unique challenges associated with obtaining astronaut/human in vivo samples for modern “omics”-based and molecular analyses. Here, transcriptomics revealed an increased abundance of TERRA transcripts in bulk cDNA, single-cell cDNA, and direct RNAseq data, during both long (One Year) and short-duration (3-day) spaceflight as compared to pre-flight ground controls. The presence of variants of the canonical TERRA motif (5’-UUAGGG-3’) in the telomeric RNA likely represent the contribution of previously reported non-canonical telomeric motifs7, and motifs with high levels of correlation to 5’-UUAGGG-3’ served as proxies for detection of TERRA. This was particularly evident in the case of our Twins Study data, where the top ten motifs correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson’s r = 0.99). We note that the counts of shorter k-mers may be partially contributed to by the counts of longer k-mers (such as UUAGGG explaining UUAGG). However, these motifs are often subsets of sequence, and the results are significant per-motif or across all sequences. The lower values of r in the Inspiration4 data may be the result of higher levels of RNA degradation or the shorter mission duration – nevertheless, these data also showed that all top motifs were significantly enriched following spaceflight, consistent with the higher levels of TERRA detected by the plurality of methods employed. It is also worth noting the much higher radiation dose-rate for the Inspiration4 high-elevation orbital mission (1.57 mSv/day) vs. the One Year Mission in LEO for the NASA Twins Study (0.42 mSv/day), potentially suggestive of a dose response in terms of TERRA expression71,93, and an important avenue of investigation for future missions. Mechanistically insightful was the observation that simulated microgravity alone did not induce similar increases in TERRA abundance. Although terrestrial analogs like rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines may not precisely replicate microgravity conditions in space, they are often used for such purposes as a proxy94, since they are the only reasonable or available option, and they facilitate testing the isolated effect of this single stressor. Our finding of elevated abundance of TERRA transcripts in the Earth-bound high-altitude climbers of Mt Everest in vivo, who also experienced telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in this somewhat similar stressful and higher-radiation environment68, further supports this conclusion. Also relevant in this regard is that radiation dose rates from more damaging cosmic radiations increase with altitude, and doses per Everest expedition are in the range of 1 mSv [International Radiation Protection Association]. Given the intriguing human in vivo evidence, we pursued in vitro studies to characterize the response and investigate whether TERRA might be involved in a general DNA damage response to IR-induced DSBs. Human U2OS ALT cells were utilized due to their high levels of TERRA, as well as the indications of ALT/ALT-like activity observed during spaceflight and the high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest68,95. Transcription-dependent increases in the numbers of TERRA foci were observed in irradiated populations (compared to non-irradiated controls), consistent with previous reports of upregulation of TERRA following treatment with the chemotherapeutic and radiomimetic drug bleomycin96, as well as with increased TERRA transcription upon treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces DSBs97. Because all of these DNA damaging agents induce DSBs randomly throughout the genome, we next queried whether TERRA might be responding specifically to DSBs within telomeres themselves. To address this possibility, we employed the EN-T targeting system due to its effective induction of telomere-specific DSBs as opposed to single-strand damage, such as that induced by reactive oxygen species62,90, an important consideration since oxidative stress is also associated with IR exposure and has been shown to increase TERRA levels in normal cells98,99. Telomere-specific DSBs induced by EN-T and TRF1-only (positive control in U2OS ALT cells) were confirmed via triple co-localization of FLAG-γH2AX-telomere foci, events not observed with empty-vector transfected or untransfected populations. Importantly, hybridized TERRA was directly visualized specifically at telomeric DSB damage sites, as evidenced by triple co-localization of FLAG-TERRA-TRF2 foci. Furthermore, a striking redistribution of abundant and “free” (unbound) TERRA to hybridized (bound) TERRA occurred in response to induction of telomere-specific DSBs, supportive evidence of TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation at break sites. Bearing in mind that U2OS cells experience a defective G1 checkpoint due to truncated WIP1 (wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1) and p16 deficiency (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor)89, and further that the HR proteins RAD51 and RAD52 have been shown to be required for TERRA interactions at telomeres40,88, we employed a Geminin-GFP/EdU based strategy as per our previous63 to determine cell cycle profiles of interphase nuclei experiencing telomeric DSBs. Positively transfected EN-T and TRF1-only cells accumulated in G2-phase, consistent with a DNA damage/telomeric DSB-induced G2 block. U2OS cell populations transfected with empty vector also accumulated in G2, reflective of transfection-induced toxicity, cellular stress, and/or more general DNA damage92. Notably, cell cycle distributions of TERRA foci showed parallel dynamics, in that concomitant enrichment of TERRA foci in G2 was observed in all three transfected populations. Since TERRA responded not only to telomere-specific DNA/DSB damage (EN-T, TRF1-only), but also to the cellular stress of transfection (empty vector), our data is consistent with previous reports demonstrating crosstalk between cellular stress and TERRA induction [reviewed in ref. 39]. Results are also consistent with TERRA foci in empty vector populations not being associated with telomere-specific DSBs/broken telomeres because they did not colocalize with γ-H2AX at telomeres. Telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative stress-related base damage likely contributes to TERRA’s response, whether associated with IR or cellular stress, and especially when exposure is chronic in nature68. Taken together, these results support a telomere-specific DDR in the space radiation environment whereby TERRA transcription is triggered upon telomeric damage resulting from chronic oxidative stress and on-going damage to telomeres, which includes DSB induction and “broken” telomeres93. Nascent TERRA is then retained at, and readily-available free (unbound) TERRA is recruited to telomeric DSB damage sites, where it binds extensive tracks of resected single-stranded 5’ C-rich telomeric DNA63. Consistent with recent findings100, as well as our direct visualization of hybridized TERRA at telomeric DSB damage sites, such recruitment and redistribution of TERRA results in protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids that serve to prevent further resection at damaged/broken telomeres, as well as facilitate RNA-templated repair101,102 via homologous recombination-dependent elongation in G2 as a means of restoring functional telomeres. In addition to providing a template for HR-directed repair of broken telomeres in cycling cells, and thereby potentially facilitating transient induction of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes in normal cells and contributing to changes in telomere length dynamics (very long and very short telomeres), we speculate that TERRA may also facilitate such repair, e.g., via increased mobility and/or serving as a scaffold for recruitment of required repair machinery103. The relevance of these findings is further highlighted by our recent demonstration that telomere dysfunction can stimulate translation of TERRA into two novel telomeric dipeptide repeat signaling proteins with the potential of inducing genomic instability and inflammation, intriguing results that also challenge the presumed “non-coding” nature of TERRA35,104. Thus, results offer important mechanistic insight that can be integrated into future studies with the ultimate goal of informing and improving aerospace precision medicine approaches for astronauts. Results also have important implications for adverse health effects related to persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress – both on the off the planet; e.g., systemic chronic inflammatory responses105, advancing age106, and low dose, low dose-rate environmental or occupational radiation exposures68. Elevated radiation and oxidative stress were associated with both long- and short-duration spaceflight and high-altitude climbing, and chronic exposure is capable of transiently activating the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance via recombination in normal human cells, evidence of which was observed during spaceflight, as well as in the somewhat similar high-altitude extreme environment of climbing Mt. Everest22,68. Moreover, and consistent with recent evidence that increased TERRA transcription and associated ALT-like mechanisms pose a threat to telomere integrity so must be properly controlled in normal cells107, our results also support the possibility of targeting telomeric RNA/TERRA-mediated protection and repair of damaged telomeres associated with high dose radiation therapy78 as a promising therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive cancers.Methods RNA-Seq for astronauts Sample collection methods for the four SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crewmembers have been detailed in full71,108. Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from K2 EDTA tubes using Ficoll separation. Single-nuclei libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the NASA Twins Study subjects, sample collection (and unavoidable loss of some samples), and poly(A) + RNA preparation was as described in Garrett-Bakelman et al. 67, and for the high-altitude climbers as in Luxton et al. 68.Simulated microgravity experiments De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from 2 healthy human donors between the ages of 25 and 36 from the Stanford University Blood Center (IRB eProtocol# 13942). PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. Cells were counted and re-suspended in complete media at 1 × 106 cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES). The cell suspension of PBMCs was loaded into 10 ml disposable rotating wall vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hr to generate simulated microgravity. For the 1 G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates. 1 G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For single-cell RNA sequencing, 1 × 104 PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller, and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200, and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550. The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). FASTQ (raw data) files were processed through 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 pipeline and all bases with quality below Q20 were truncated. The “cellranger count” function was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting, and then to generate the count matrixes. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A.In vitro ionizing radiation experiments U2OS cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek II 154526) at a density of 5×105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow cell attachment. Cells were either sham-irradiated (0 Gy) or exposed to 137Cs γ-rays (2 Gy) while rotating in a Mark I irradiator (J.L Sheppard) located at Colorado State University. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours prior to fixation. For inhibition of transcription and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses, U2OS cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) 24 h prior to addition of 10 ug/ml Actinomycin-D (ActD; ThermoFisher). Cells were collected in Trizol at 3, 6, 8 and 24 hr after treatment. Control U2OS cells (DMSO treated) were collected after 24 h. RNA (500 ng) was used to make cDNA using standard reverse transcription (ImPromII-Reverse Transcription System-Promega). 25 µL reaction mixtures containing GAPDH or 18S rRNA primers, template (1:10,000 dilution cDNA) and QX200™ ddPCR™ EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad: 186–4034) were used for the ddPCR platform (QX200 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR™) System – Bio-Rad). Droplet generation and transfer of emulsified samples to PCR plates was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Instruction Manual, QX200™ Droplet Generator – Bio-Rad). The cycling protocol for the ddPCR platform started with a 95 °C enzyme activation step for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of a two-step cycling protocol (95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min) with a ramp rate of 2 °C/second. Post-cycling protocol was in accordance with the kit instructions (Bio-Rad –186–4034). For TERRA foci detection following inhibition of transcription, U2OS cells on chamber-slides were treated with 10 ug/ml ActD, 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure; cells were fixed and TERRA foci detected using RNA-FISH as described below.In vitro cell culture and transfections Human U2OS ALT cells (provided by Dr. Jiri Lucas, University of Copenhagen) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TRAS1-EN-TRF1 (EN-T) and TRF1-only plasmids, both driven by a CMV promoter and possessing a C-terminal FLAG-tag for visualization, were constructed from a CMV-driven TRAS1-EN-TRF1 plasmid obtained from Dr. Haruhiko Fujiwara (University of Tokyo). To generate the TRF1-only plasmid, the TRAS1-EN-TRF1construct was digested and the EN fragment removed. The mutated Cas9 pSpCas9m(BB)-2A-Puro (PX462) V2.0 (empty vector) plasmid (Addgene plasmid #62987; http://n2t.net/addgene:62987; RRID:Addgene_62987) was provided by Dr. Claudia Wiese (Colorado State University). Transient transfections of EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control; previously shown to recruit γ-H2AX to telomeres in U2OS ALT cells)88, and empty vector (EV; transfection control) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) were performed per manufacturer’s instructions on cell cultures reaching ~60–80% confluency in Opti-MEM (Gibco), which was replaced with regular media 8 h later. Untransfected (UT; negative control) populations had neither plasmid nor Lipofectamine, and unless specified otherwise all experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection. A U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin (green; S-G2-M) was established by transfecting cells with 0.5 ug of the Kan-FUCCI-Green (S-G2-M) plasmid (AM-V9016, Amalgaam) as previously described63. Briefly, plasmids were delivered using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media. One week later, cells were trypsinized and individual cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. A single positive clone was identified and expanded in the presence of 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate (GoldBio). After reaching ~90% confluency, cells were split into a 24-well plate, then 10 days later into a 12-well plate, and one week later into a 6-well plate. Cells were transferred into T-25 flasks, and then after 6 days into T-75 flasks. The DMEM media containing 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate was changed every two days. FUCCI-U2OS cells stably expressing FUCCI G2-Green were transiently transfected with EN-T or TRF1-only plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacture’s instruction. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media, and cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection.RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) For combined telomeric C-rich strand detection and FLAG staining, U2OS expressing FUCCI-SG2-M-Green cells were grown on 4-well chamber slides (MilliCell EZ). Forty-eight hours following transfection, chambers were removed and slides washed with Cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM PIPES at pH 6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose) containing 200 mM vanadyl for 30 seconds. Cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde in 10X PBS for 12 minutes at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer containing 200 mM vanadyl for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 70% ethanol and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (85%, 95%, 100%). For TERRA (UUAGGG) detection, 0.5 uM (TelC-Alexa 488, Bio-Synthesis) or (TelC- Alexa 647, Bio PNA 1013) Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA-CCCTAA) telomere probe was added to the hybridization buffer [50% (vol/vol) formamide, 2X (vol/vol) saline sodium citrate (SSC)] with 200 mM vanadyl, and denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. Hybridization buffer (200 ul) was added to each slide and slides were placed in a humidified chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Slides were washed twice in 50% formamide in 2X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), twice in 4X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), and once in 2X SSC + 0.1% NP-40 (2.5 min, 42 °C).RNaseA + H treatment To remove both bound and unbound TERRA, fixed and permeabilized U2OS and U2OS FUCCI-S-G2-M-Green cells were treated with a cocktail of 1 mg/ml RNaseA (degrades free RNA) and 15 U RNaseH (cleaves RNA from DNA:RNA hybrids) in 1X RNaseH buffer for 1 h at 37 °C.Immunofluorescence staining Blocking nonspecific immunoglobulin binding following FISH was carried out with 10% Goat Normal Serum (GNS) for 30 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody in 5% GNS overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times with 1X PBS at room temperature. Protein signals were visualized by incubating slides with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature and washed three times in 1X PBS. Lastly, slides were mounted and counterstained with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies and concentrations used include mouse antiFLAG (Sigma M2 F1804, 1:2000), rabbit anti-human FLAG (Sigma 7425 1:300), mouse anti-human TRF2 (Santa Cruz B-5, 1:200), and mouse anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139), clone JBW301 (Sigma 05-636, 1:10). Secondary antibodies and concentrations used include: Alexa-647 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A21236, 1:750), Alexa-594 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A11005, 1:750), Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit (ThermoFisher A11008, 1:750). For EdU detection, Click-iT EdU Alexa Flour 555 (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions.Cell cycle analysis Utilizing a U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin, the cell cycle phase of interphase nuclei was determined. Definitive identification of cells in S-phase was achieved via pulse-labeling with the thymidine analog 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 min prior to fixation; 10 uM EdU (Click-iT, Invitrogen) was added to the culture and incubated at 37 °C. The scoring strategy to distinguish cell cycle phase of transiently transfected FUCCI U2OS cells was defined as cells positive for FLAG were in G1, cells positive for FLAG and EdU were in S, and cells positive for FLAG and GemininGFP were in G2.Microscopy and quantitative analysis Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 epi-fluorescent microscope outfitted with a 63X/1.4 N.A objective and a Coolsnap ES2 camera, and analyzed using Zen Blue software. Images were captured for co-localization 3-D analyses (50 per condition), each consisting of 21 Z-stacks (0.2 µm per plane) in combinations of 4 wavelengths (colors). Quantitative analysis was performed using Fiji (ImageJ2 software) and Cell Profiler using our customized pipeline for 3D reconstructions and simultaneous dual and triple co-localizations of the different markers.Data analysis For RNA-seq data analysis, the total baseline counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were calculated with jellyfish109 in both the single nuclei RNA-Seq data (Inspiration4) and poly(A) + RNA-Seq data (Twins Study). These data were filtered for reads containing UUAGGG 6-mers, accounting for reverse complementarity. In these sets of reads, the counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were again calculated, accounting for circular shifts; the normalized count of each k-mer was calculated as its absolute count divided by the total count of all k-mers in the dataset for each k (5 ≤ k ≤ 7). Considering the different experimental designs (Inspiration4: longitudinal cohort; Twins Study: synchronized subject/control; and Mt. Everest climbers: longitudinal cohort), we classified the data into conceptually similar categories: ground (either pre-flight or ground control), space effect (either in-flight or immediately post-flight), and recovery (long-term post-flight); and for the Mount Everest data, pre-ascent (low altitude), ascent (high altitude), and descent (low altitude). The simulated data was classified into microgravity (uG) and Earth gravity (1 G) categories. A Pearson’s correlation matrix of normalized counts of k-mers to the UUAGGG motif across all samples was calculated. Independently for the Inspiration4 data and Twins Study data, and for each motif, Mann–Whitney U tests were performed between space effect and combined non-space (ground and recovery) categories. For simulated data, Mann–Whitney U tests were performed between the uG and 1 G categories, respectively, and for the Mount Everest data, the tests were performed between the pre-ascent, ascent, and descent categories. All resultant p-values were considered together and adjusted with the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (correcting for the false discovery rate, FDR), and sorted by correlation to the UUAGGG motif (Supplementary Data 1, 2, 3). For further analysis and visualization, the ten motifs with the highest correlation (Pearson’s r) to the UUAGGG motif, including itself, were selected in each data set. For the Mann–Whitney U test and the Benjamini–Hochberg correction, the Inspiration4 data was considered in groups at each timepoint, while the Twins Study and the Mount Everest data were grouped per category, owing to the lower number of subjects and samples. Z-scored normalized counts were plotted using seaborn/matplotlib across all categories and timepoints, together with the pairwise adjusted p-values (Figs. 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 4). For in vitro cell culture experiments, all data analyses were performed using Prism 10.0.0 (GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, www.graphpad.com); Supplementary Data 5 reports all comparison statistics. For telomeric RNA-FISH (TERRA) analysis following IR exposure with and without inhibition of transcription (Actinomycin-D treatment), TERRA foci were counted in treated and control (DMSO) groups using Metamorph 7.7 (Fig. 3a). Data represent 2 independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. For EN-T and TRF1-only transfection analysis (FLAG-DAPI immunostaining), data represent 3 independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition); Supplementary Fig. 3. Significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For telomeric DSB induction validation and TERRA colocalization utilizing telomere DNA-FISH and RNA-FISH immunofluorescence (FLAG - γ-H2AX- C-strand telomere; and TRF2-TERRA, FLAG-TERRA, and FLAG-TRF2 -TERRA), the number of multiple colocalization events was counted from the sum of 21 Z-stacks reconstructed three-dimensionally using the deconvolution function on ImageJ (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 4). Quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ and Cell Profiler image analysis software 3.1.5. Data represent three independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test and by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, respectively. For evaluating TERRA distribution (bound vs. unbound), data represent 3 independent experiments (50 cells scored in each condition); Supplementary Fig. 5. Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. For cell cycle and TERRA distributions (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7), data represent five independent experiments (50 cells scored in each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.Human participants research Informed consent was obtained from all human research participants.
