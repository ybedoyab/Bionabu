    "abstract": "Abstract Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.

    "introduction": "Introduction Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7 among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown. Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive. To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1 g for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1 g on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19. This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.",
    "methods": "Methods Mice C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for the space experiments and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for ground control experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B for MHU-1, No. 018-011D for MHU-4, and No. 018-036D for MHU-5); Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010A for MHU-1, No. EB19-003 for MHU-4, and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5); and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1 for MHU-1, No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4, and No. JAXA MHU-5/ FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). The experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America and complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. MHU missions Figure 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1 present an overview of the three MHU missions and two kinds of centrifuges, MARS-S and MARS-L. The detailed design of the three MHU missions has been previously published19. In all the MHU missions, 8–9-week-old C57BL/6J male mice in a TCU were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the HCU, one mouse per cage, and then housed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35, 25, and 26 days for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively. MHU-1 mission: Twelve C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-9 on June 18, 2016, from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. The mice were divided into two groups, AG and MG mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1 g environment (1 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 77 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-4 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-17 on May 7, 2019, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-S group was kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment (1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 31 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-5 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-20 on March 10, 2020, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-L group was kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment (1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 21 rpm) in a MARS-L centrifuge. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. Experiments on the GC group in each mission were conducted at the JAXA Laboratory in Japan a few months after the space experiments were completed. Six age-matched (8- or 9-weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice per mission were used, and the time spent in the TCU or HCU was the same for each space experiment. Phenotypic analyses for all three missions were conducted by the same researchers. Unavoidably, it took approximately 2, 1.2, and 2.3 days of transport time for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively, after return to Earth for initiating the experimental analysis at Explora Biolabs. The return phase and animal dissection After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach (Supplementary Fig. 1). JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for further analysis. The health conditions of the mice were checked and their body weights were measured. Subsequently, the mid-air righting reflex test was performed. Each mouse oriented in the supine position was dropped twice from a height of approximately 40 cm above the padded surface, and the average time for righting was analyzed using high-speed video (DSC-RX100M5, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The rotarod performance test was performed after the righting reflex test. First, the mouse was placed on a rod rotating at a speed of 2 rpm to acclimate it, and the experiment began when the mouse was able to stay on the rod (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan). The rotation speed of the rod was accelerated from 2 to 40 rpm in 2 min using a ramping acceleration mode. The time each mouse could stay on the rod was measured. For each mouse, the rotor test was performed three times, and the average of the last two tests was used as the data for each mouse. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized using exsanguination and dissected to collect tissue samples. Samples that required cryopreservation were transported by air in a refrigerated box containing dry ice. The journey from the laboratory where the dissections were performed in the USA to JAXA’s laboratory in Japan took several days in all instances (MHU-1, 4.0 days; MHU-4, 7.5 days; MHU-5, 5.5 days), and temperature changes during that time were checked using temperature data loggers. Micro-computed tomography analysis After fixation with 70% ethanol, distal regions of the femur were analyzed. Micro-computed tomography scanning was performed using a ScanXmate-A100S Scanner (Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan). Reconstructed three-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to previously published guidelines38 using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm3), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, µm), trabecular bone number (Tb.N, /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp, µm; intervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th, µm), and cross-sectional area of cortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm2) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. A percentage of the trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in the trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm3) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm3) were measured with a bone mineral quantification phantom. Measurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin Plasma levels of TRAP and osteocalcin were measured with MouseTRAP™ (TRAcP 5b) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, UK), and Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Isolation of bone tissues Bone tissues were prepared as previously described with modifications20. Connective tissues and the periosteum of femurs and tibiae were removed, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After bone marrow cells were removed from the diaphyses of femurs and tibiae by flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the bones were incubated with 1 mg/mL collagenase and 2 mg/mL dispase in alpha-minimum essential medium at 37 °C for 20 min, and then treated using a micro-interdental brush. The remaining bone was used as an osteocyte-enriched bone. The bones were collected in TRIZOL reagent and ground into a powder using a tissue pulverizer (Minilys, Bertin Technologies, France) for total RNA extraction. RNA-sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA depletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 36 bases) was performed using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 10.1.1; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as the total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with 0 counts in all samples and genes with total lead counts of 5 or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of DGE tool (edgeR)39 in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21.0.3; Qiagen). Differentially expressed genes were extracted among the conditions (MHU-1_GC vs. MHU-1_MG, MHU-4_4GC vs. MHU-4_4PG, and MHU-5_5GC vs. MHU-5_5PG) with FDR-corrected P < 0.05. Gene functional analysis The clustering heatmap was generated in Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). GO analysis of each cluster was performed using the Enrichr webtool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/). Histological and immunostaining of tissue sections For histological analysis, the spleen and thymus were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of 5-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides and subjected to HE staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, the spleen and thymus were snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan). Frozen sections of 6-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides coated with amino silane. After fixing with ice-cold acetone for 5 min, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then treated with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3e (BioLegend; 100236, 1:200), anti-CD45R (B220, BioLegend; 103228, 1:400), anti-TER119 (BioLegend; 116203, 1:300), anti-Keratin 5 (Krt5; Biolegend 905503, 1:500), and Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-Keratin 8 (Krt8; Abcam ab192467, 1:50) antibodies, Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-mouse Aire antibody (eBioscience; 53-5934-82, 1:500), and Biotin-labeled UEA-1 (Vector laboratories; B-1065-2, 1:50) in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 1 h at 24 °C, after washing, and further incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen; A-11035, 1:500) Alexa Flour 546-labeled Streptavidin (Invitrogen; S11225, 1:500) for 1 h at 24 °C, the sections were covered with glass coverslips using a mounting solution. Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope. At least three different sections were analyzed for each sample (Leica, SP8). Statistical analyses All data are presented as the mean of biological replicates and dots of the individual sample data. Comparisons between groups (excluding RNA-seq analysis, as explained previously) were performed using appropriate statistical tests for each data set. Tests for normal distribution were carried out using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student’s t-test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Non-normally distributed data were tested using the Mann–Whitney U test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.",
    "results": "Results and discussion Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions Figure 1A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5). C57BL/6J male mice in the Transporting Cage Unit (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Space Vehicle from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, and subsequently transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35 days (MHU-1), 25 days (MHU-4), and 26 days (MHU-5). For the MHU-1 mission, 12 mice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial 1 g (AG) mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1 g environment in the MARS-S centrifuge. In the MHU-4 and -5 missions, six partial gravity (PG) mice were kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment in MARS-S and MARS-L centrifuges, respectively. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male mice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in each mission. Experiments were conducted using six mice per mission group. A more detailed schedule for each mission is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unavoidably, it took 1–2 days of transport time after the cargo landed to collect each organ. This information is detailed in the Method section. For both missions, the change in body weight before and after the space experiment occurred at approximately the same rate of increase19. In addition, three mice in MHU-5 experienced significant weight loss after returning to Earth due to anomalies in the TCU water supply system. These mice were not used for the analysis of RNA-seq. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of spaceflight experiments and behavioral tests. (A) Overview of the Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU) missions. Each experimental group is color-coded (MG (microgravity) for magenta, AG (artificial 1 g) for dark blue, PG (partial gravity, 1/6 g) for orange, and GC (1 g) for green), and each color corresponds to a letter color and a plot point in the figure. 1GC: MHU-1_GC; 4GC: MHU-4_GC; 5GC: MHU-5_GC; MG: MHU-1_MG; AG: MHU-1_AG; 4PG: MHU-4_PG; 5PG: MHU-5_PG. (B,C) Effects of each gravity condition on vestibular function using a mid-air righting reflex test (B) and a rotarod performance test (C). Data are represented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 5–6). P-value from the Student’s t-test is indicated as ***P < 0.001. Behavioral tests Prior to dissecting the mice after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, we visually inspected their appearance, body hair, whisker morphology, incisor tooth morphology, abdominal hardness, and limb morphology. None of the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight measurements, a mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and coordinated movements (Fig. 1B,C). In MHU-1, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG mice (176 ± 19 ms) compared to those in artificial 1 g (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143 ± 12 ms and 130 ± 7 ms, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of partial gravity (4PG) mice (212 ± 8 ms) in MHU-4 was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155 ± 3 ms), whereas that of 5PG mice (145 ± 19 ms) in MHU-5 was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150 ± 4 ms). In the rotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48 ± 4 s) and MG (44 ± 6 s) mice was significantly shorter than that in 1GC (74 ± 10 s) mice in the MHU-1 mission (Fig. 1C). However, the differences between PG and GC in MHU-4 (4PG: 49 ± 5 s, 4GC: 37 ± 7 s) and MHU-5 (5PG: 83 ± 11 s, 5GC: 70 ± 14 s) were not significant. In the righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS-S and MARS-L in the same 1/6 g group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas 5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the 1 g group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows: (1) Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber of MARS-S, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-L, which has long arms. Therefore, each time the height of the head changes, 4PG receives a larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have affected vestibular function. (2) Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG. The difference is particularly noticeable in a small gravity, such as 1/6 g; the gravity fluctuation was larger in 4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be examined in future research. Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig. 2A,B). MG mice in the MHU-1 mission showed a significant decrease of 70% (1GC; 15.1 ± 2.2%, AG; 14.5 ± 1.2%, MG; 4.5 ± 2.7%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU-4 and -5 missions showed a significant decrease in BV/TV of only 30% (4GC; 20.6 ± 2.3%, 4PG; 14.4 ± 3.5%) and 28% (5GC; 27.4 ± 5.6%, 5PG; 19.6 ± 2.5%), respectively, although housing in MHU-4 and -5 was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-1. In cortical bone, cross-sectional area (Ct.Ar) and thickness (Ct.Th) decreased significantly by 17% (Ct.Ar: 1GC; 0.87 ± 0.02 mm2, MG; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2) and 16% (Ct.Th: 1GC; 141.9 ± 2.1 µm, MG; 118.9 ± 7.7 µm) in MG mice in MHU-1. In PG mice, Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were reduced by 5% without significant difference in MHU-4 (Ct.Ar: 4GC; 0.91 ± 0.02 mm2, 4PG; 0.86 ± 0.07 mm2, and Ct.Th: 4GC; 150.4 ± 1.2 µm, 4PG; 142.7 ± 9.9 µm), while Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were significantly reduced by 7% and 5%, respectively, in MHU-5 (Ct.Ar: 5GC; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2, 5PG; 0.67 ± 0.02 mm2, and Ct.Th: 5GC; 116.0 ± 3.8 µm, 5PG; 109.7 ± 2.7 µm). Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6 g environment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the 1/6 g environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig. 2C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; 3.9 ± 0.5 Unit/L, MG; 5.4 ± 0.5 Unit/L) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60.8 ± 19.7 ng/mL, MG; 30.0 ± 2.7 ng/mL) in MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-4: 127%, 4GC; 4.7 ± 0.3 Unit/L, 4PG; 6.0 ± 0.4 Unit/L and MHU-5: 139%, 5GC; 4.0 ± 0.9 Unit/L, 5PG; 5.6 ± 0.9 Unit/L) and osteocalcin (MHU-4: 44%, 4GC; 34.8 ± 5.9 ng/mL, 4PG; 15.4 ± 4.0 ng/mL and MHU-5: 51%, 5GC; 36.6 ± 4.7 ng/mL, 5PG; 18.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL) in PG mice were comparable, indicating that these changes in proportions were inconsistent with the differences in bone loss rates between microgravity and the 1/6 g environment. Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin values between AG and MG mice in MHU-1 indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be independent of gravity. Fig. 2.

Non-normally distributed data are indicated as §. Comparison of gene expression in osteocyte-rich bone tissues during microgravity and lunar gravity To verify how gravity affects gene expression in load-bearing bones, we collected and prepared femurs and tibiae20 for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of an osteocyte-rich bone fraction. A total of 485 genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping among MG, AG, 1GC in MHU-1 and 4PG, 4GC in MHU-4, revealing five distinct gene clusters (Fig. 3A). Similar clusters between samples were not classified by the magnitude of gravity, but by each of the MHU-1 and -4 missions. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression at 1/6 g were lesser than those in microgravity. However, as observed in previous comparisons of our thymic RNA-seq data14, this may be due to differences in flight schedules between missions. Since this makes changes in gene expression classified into clusters 2 and 5 less credible, the present study focused on clusters 1, 3, and 4. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified actin regulation-related genes in cluster 1 (Fig. 3B). Considering that the cytoskeleton is an initial gravity sensor20, this upregulation could be caused by transmitting variations in external mechanical forces into intracellular chemical signals. Cluster 3 and 4, downregulated in MG mice, included genes responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the cell cycle; abnormalities in the cell cycle of osteoblasts have been previously reported in microgravity experiments21 (Fig. 3B). Although these genes were downregulated in the microgravity environment, they were suppressed in the 1/6 g environment. Fig. 3.

Enhancement of osteoblast and osteoclast signals under microgravity The unloading environment during spaceflight causes loss of bone mass in mice23,24, which is induced by inhibited osteoblastic bone formation and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption in a simulated microgravity environment25. However, since AG and lunar gravity had not been used in these studies, the effect of different loading gravities on gene expression in bone during spaceflight remains unclear. Hence, to elucidate the effects of microgravity, 1/6 g, and 1 g onboard environment on the gene expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction, eight osteoblast lineage marker genes and seven osteoclast marker genes were selected and visualized using heat mapping (Fig. 3C). We compared the expression levels of osteoblast markers Bglap, Bmp4, Sost, and Spp1, which are mainly expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone and regulate osteoblastic bone formation. The expressions of Sost, Bmp4, and Spp1 were significantly higher in MG mice than those in 1GC mice. However, Bglap expression was significantly lower in MG mice than that in 1GC, and tended to be lower than that in AG mice. In addition, these changes were absent when comparing 4GC and 4PG mice in the MHU-4 mission (Fig. 3D). Changes in Bglap expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction and the plasma concentrations of its product, osteocalcin, were similar between the experimental groups (Fig. 2C). Though bone loss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of some osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. A recent study using medaka fish showed that osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity22. Therefore, the gene upregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight. In contrast, Bglap expression was significantly downregulated under microgravity. In a previous 14-day space experiment, murine osteoblasts showed reduced expression of transcription factors and proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation23. This suggests potential negative regulation of gene expression for osteoblast differentiation during spaceflight, following an initial phase of upregulation. In summary, osteoblast-related genes may undergo distinct regulatory mechanisms contingent on the specific phase of spaceflight. Further, the expressions of osteoclast marker genes, Acp5 and Ctsk, both of which are specifically expressed by osteoclasts, regulate osteoclastic bone resorption, were significantly upregulated in MG mice compared to those in GC mice, and these changes were partially suppressed in PG mice (Fig. 3E). The changes in Acp5 expression between the experimental groups were similar to those in the plasma levels of TRAP, the product of Acp5. Thus, the expressions of osteoblast and osteoclast markers were significantly altered in the bone under microgravity, and these changes were mostly suppressed under AG and 1/6 g, suggesting that the bone is highly sensitive to gravitational alterations. The thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not prevent weight loss Following spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy24–26, and findings of the MHU-1 mission also suggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in a microgravity environment, and artificial 1 g partially prevents this decrease14. In MHU-1, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in AG mice was reduced to 79.8% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, AG; 1.38 ± 0.14) of that in 1GC mice, and that in MG mice was reduced to 56.6% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, MG; 0.98 ± 0.17) of that in 1GC mice. In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in PG mice in MHU-4 and -5 decreased to 76.4% (4GC; 1.44 ± 0.17, 4PG; 1.10 ± 0.22) and 79.2% (5GC; 1.49 ± 0.14, 5PG; 1.18 ± 0.04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that 1/6 g and artificial 1 g partially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig. 4A). Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing in a 1/6 g environment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4B). This confirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our previous study14. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin-5 (Krt5; a marker for the medullary region) and keratin-8 (Krt-8; a marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU-1 MG mice showed that Krt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region14. In the present study, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions in PG mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire (a transcription factor expressed in the medullary region), Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1; a marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their expression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-114. Thus, the abnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary, 1/6 g and artificial 1 g partially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the microgravity environment. Fig. 4.

(E) Gene ontology analysis of genes in each cluster. Gene expression in the thymus under different gravitational loads RNA-seq analysis was performed to determine the effects of different gravitational environments on gene expression. A total of 2880 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, subsequently revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 4D). Horizontal clustering between mice classified them into 1 g group (1GC, 4GC, 5GC, and AG) and less than 1 g group (4PG, 5PG, and MG). Furthermore, even in the 1 g environment, the space experiment (AG) and GC experiments (1GC, 4GC, 5GC) were classified into different groups. This may reflect changes in the process of the space experiment and GC experiment. GO analysis further revealed that cluster 1, which was downregulated in PG and MG mice compared to that in GCs, contained genes associated with endothelial morphogenesis (Fig. 4E). Consistently, altered localization of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor has been reported in human CD34+ stem cells under simulated microgravity27. Cluster 3 and 4 indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in GCs; particularly genes included in cluster 4 were only upregulated in MG mice. Clusters 3 and 4 included genes associated with cell migration. Thymic atrophy is caused by various physiological stressors, including aging and infections28–30. Previous studies using protozoan-infected mice have demonstrated thymic atrophy, wherein T cells migrate from the thymus to peripheral lymphoid organs31. Similarly, the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g may potentially induce the release of several molecular ligands that control cell migration and contribute to the establishment of thymic atrophy. Cluster 2 and 5, downregulated in MG mice, comprised genes associated with the cell cycle. RNA-seq analysis of the thymus from two independent flight experiments, MHU-1 and -2, has revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the two missions owing to differences in flight schedules and conditions14. Nevertheless, integrated results have shown an impact on cell cycle progression without significant signs of apoptosis enhancement in relatively long-duration spaceflight14. Consistently, apoptosis did not influence any of the five clusters. Moreover, our results implied the influence of cell cycle-regulating genes in clusters 2 and 5. Cluster 2 is downregulated in MG, but not in PG mice, suggesting that it contributes to the suppressing thymic weight loss in 1/6 g. Cluster 5 showed different gene expression profiles between 4 and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage. Interestingly, the cell cycle may be affected by slight changes in gravity. Changes in gene expression in the mouse thymus due to hypergravity are inhibited by a surgical lesion in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear32. The simultaneous exposure of human fibroblasts to simulated microgravity and radiation exhibits more pronounced effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes than those with radiation exposure alone33. Hence, our results demonstrated the effect of gravity on the cell cycle in the space experiment by comparing the PG and MG mice. Additionally, osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs have been reported during hindlimb unloading34. Therefore, it is critical to determine the cancer risk associated with changes in gravity. Future studies using other gravity loads will clarify the risks of thymus atrophy and carcinogenesis during spaceflight. Our previous study implied that artificial 1 g can alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice experiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation14. In this study, we showed that 1/6 g could alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression profiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that 1/6 g is still insufficient to attenuate all changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify a gravity threshold that can prevent gene expression changes in space. In summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be involved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression. The effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity The spleen is an important secondary lymphoid organ involved in the acquired immune responses during spaceflight35. Our previous study implied that erythrocyte-related genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA1 are significantly downregulated in the spleen of MG mice in the MHU-1 mission13. To elucidate the effect of 1/6 g on secondary lymphoid organs, we analyzed the histological and gene expression changes in the spleen. Body weight-normalized spleen weights in MG mice tended to be lower than those in GC mice; the spleen weights of PG mice partially recovered from the reduction observed in MG mice (Fig. 5A). Our previous HE staining results showed that MG and PG mice have a normal splenic structure with white and red pulps (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, no specific abnormalities are observed in immunostaining with Ter119 (erythrocyte marker), B220 (B cell marker), and CD3e (T cell marker), similar to those reported previously in MG mice13 (Fig. 5C).

(G) Differentially expressed erythrocyte-related genes in (F). Data are represented as mean ± SD, and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 3). FDR-corrected P values were calculated at P < 0.05 (CLC MW, Empirical analysis of DGE tool). ***P < 0.001.RNA-seq analysis of the spleen was performed to comprehensively investigate the impact of different gravitational forces on gene expression. A total of 94 genes (FDR < 0.05) between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 5D). These genes were also classified by horizontal clustering into mice experiencing spaceflight (5PG, MG, and AG) and mice in the ground control (1GC, 4GC, and 5GC), indicating that the general gene expression changes in the spleen were caused by the space environment and experimental processes rather than by gravity changes. Although difficult to comprehend, data from 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant factors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in the spleen. Therefore, we further compared gene expressions among 4PG, 5PG, MG, and AG mice to elucidate the effects of different gravitational loads. A total of 167 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and AG mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing three distinct clusters (Fig. 5E). Horizontal clustering classified them into 1 g (AG) and less than 1 g (4PG, 5PG, and MG) groups, indicating that PG mice showed gene expression patterns similar to those of MG mice. GO analysis also suggested that cluster 2, with upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice, included genes associated with the inflammatory response (Supplementary Fig. 2). In cluster 3, upregulation was observed only in MG mice, suggesting that 1/6 g could partially alleviate the gene expression changes in microgravity. We further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes, regulated by Gata1 and Tal1, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments13. Moreover, experiments in Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by flight-related stress but by other space-specific factors36. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces on erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated by Gata1 and Tal1 (Fig. 5F). All genes were downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice. Furthermore, we compared the expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2, and Rhag, which are known to regress after spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression36 (Fig. 5G). The expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, and Hba-a2 were significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either AG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis-related genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during spaceflight37. Although we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study has several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second day after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the RNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the 1 g environment. Although space experiments must address various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as a resource for future research. In conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g in the bone, thymus, and spleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity were not completely alleviated in 1/6 g. In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around 1/6 g, considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic abnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were used to generate 1/6 g in MHU-4 and -5, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity loads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions. This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration.",

Copyright notice ID: 11579474 PMID: 39567640 Abstract Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight. Keywords: Spaceflight, Microgravity, Thymus, Spleen, Bone, Gene expressionSubject terms: Transcriptomics, Immunology, BoneIntroduction Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7 among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown. Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive. To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1 g for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1 g on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19. This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.Results and discussion Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions Figure 1A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5). C57BL/6J male mice in the Transporting Cage Unit (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Space Vehicle from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, and subsequently transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35 days (MHU-1), 25 days (MHU-4), and 26 days (MHU-5). For the MHU-1 mission, 12 mice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial 1 g (AG) mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1 g environment in the MARS-S centrifuge. In the MHU-4 and -5 missions, six partial gravity (PG) mice were kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment in MARS-S and MARS-L centrifuges, respectively. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male mice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in each mission. Experiments were conducted using six mice per mission group. A more detailed schedule for each mission is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unavoidably, it took 1–2 days of transport time after the cargo landed to collect each organ. This information is detailed in the Method section. For both missions, the change in body weight before and after the space experiment occurred at approximately the same rate of increase19. In addition, three mice in MHU-5 experienced significant weight loss after returning to Earth due to anomalies in the TCU water supply system. These mice were not used for the analysis of RNA-seq.

Each experimental group is color-coded (MG (microgravity) for magenta, AG (artificial 1 g) for dark blue, PG (partial gravity, 1/6 g) for orange, and GC (1 g) for green), and each color corresponds to a letter color and a plot point in the figure. 1GC: MHU-1_GC; 4GC: MHU-4_GC; 5GC: MHU-5_GC; MG: MHU-1_MG; AG: MHU-1_AG; 4PG: MHU-4_PG; 5PG: MHU-5_PG. (B,C) Effects of each gravity condition on vestibular function using a mid-air righting reflex test (B) and a rotarod performance test (C). Data are represented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 5–6). P-value from the Student’s t-test is indicated as ***P < 0.001.Behavioral tests Prior to dissecting the mice after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, we visually inspected their appearance, body hair, whisker morphology, incisor tooth morphology, abdominal hardness, and limb morphology. None of the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight measurements, a mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and coordinated movements (Fig. 1B,C). In MHU-1, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG mice (176 ± 19 ms) compared to those in artificial 1 g (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143 ± 12 ms and 130 ± 7 ms, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of partial gravity (4PG) mice (212 ± 8 ms) in MHU-4 was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155 ± 3 ms), whereas that of 5PG mice (145 ± 19 ms) in MHU-5 was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150 ± 4 ms). In the rotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48 ± 4 s) and MG (44 ± 6 s) mice was significantly shorter than that in 1GC (74 ± 10 s) mice in the MHU-1 mission (Fig. 1C). However, the differences between PG and GC in MHU-4 (4PG: 49 ± 5 s, 4GC: 37 ± 7 s) and MHU-5 (5PG: 83 ± 11 s, 5GC: 70 ± 14 s) were not significant. In the righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS-S and MARS-L in the same 1/6 g group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas 5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the 1 g group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows: (1) Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber of MARS-S, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-L, which has long arms. Therefore, each time the height of the head changes, 4PG receives a larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have affected vestibular function. (2) Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG. The difference is particularly noticeable in a small gravity, such as 1/6 g; the gravity fluctuation was larger in 4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be examined in future research.Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig. 2A,B). MG mice in the MHU-1 mission showed a significant decrease of 70% (1GC; 15.1 ± 2.2%, AG; 14.5 ± 1.2%, MG; 4.5 ± 2.7%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU-4 and -5 missions showed a significant decrease in BV/TV of only 30% (4GC; 20.6 ± 2.3%, 4PG; 14.4 ± 3.5%) and 28% (5GC; 27.4 ± 5.6%, 5PG; 19.6 ± 2.5%), respectively, although housing in MHU-4 and -5 was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-1. In cortical bone, cross-sectional area (Ct.Ar) and thickness (Ct.Th) decreased significantly by 17% (Ct.Ar: 1GC; 0.87 ± 0.02 mm2, MG; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2) and 16% (Ct.Th: 1GC; 141.9 ± 2.1 µm, MG; 118.9 ± 7.7 µm) in MG mice in MHU-1. In PG mice, Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were reduced by 5% without significant difference in MHU-4 (Ct.Ar: 4GC; 0.91 ± 0.02 mm2, 4PG; 0.86 ± 0.07 mm2, and Ct.Th: 4GC; 150.4 ± 1.2 µm, 4PG; 142.7 ± 9.9 µm), while Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were significantly reduced by 7% and 5%, respectively, in MHU-5 (Ct.Ar: 5GC; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2, 5PG; 0.67 ± 0.02 mm2, and Ct.Th: 5GC; 116.0 ± 3.8 µm, 5PG; 109.7 ± 2.7 µm). Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6 g environment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the 1/6 g environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig. 2C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; 3.9 ± 0.5 Unit/L, MG; 5.4 ± 0.5 Unit/L) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60.8 ± 19.7 ng/mL, MG; 30.0 ± 2.7 ng/mL) in MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-4: 127%, 4GC; 4.7 ± 0.3 Unit/L, 4PG; 6.0 ± 0.4 Unit/L and MHU-5: 139%, 5GC; 4.0 ± 0.9 Unit/L, 5PG; 5.6 ± 0.9 Unit/L) and osteocalcin (MHU-4: 44%, 4GC; 34.8 ± 5.9 ng/mL, 4PG; 15.4 ± 4.0 ng/mL and MHU-5: 51%, 5GC; 36.6 ± 4.7 ng/mL, 5PG; 18.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL) in PG mice were comparable, indicating that these changes in proportions were inconsistent with the differences in bone loss rates between microgravity and the 1/6 g environment. Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin values between AG and MG mice in MHU-1 indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be independent of gravity. Fig. 2.

Non-normally distributed data are indicated as §.Comparison of gene expression in osteocyte-rich bone tissues during microgravity and lunar gravity To verify how gravity affects gene expression in load-bearing bones, we collected and prepared femurs and tibiae20 for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of an osteocyte-rich bone fraction. A total of 485 genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping among MG, AG, 1GC in MHU-1 and 4PG, 4GC in MHU-4, revealing five distinct gene clusters (Fig. 3A). Similar clusters between samples were not classified by the magnitude of gravity, but by each of the MHU-1 and -4 missions. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression at 1/6 g were lesser than those in microgravity. However, as observed in previous comparisons of our thymic RNA-seq data14, this may be due to differences in flight schedules between missions. Since this makes changes in gene expression classified into clusters 2 and 5 less credible, the present study focused on clusters 1, 3, and 4. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified actin regulation-related genes in cluster 1 (Fig. 3B). Considering that the cytoskeleton is an initial gravity sensor20, this upregulation could be caused by transmitting variations in external mechanical forces into intracellular chemical signals. Cluster 3 and 4, downregulated in MG mice, included genes responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the cell cycle; abnormalities in the cell cycle of osteoblasts have been previously reported in microgravity experiments21 (Fig. 3B). Although these genes were downregulated in the microgravity environment, they were suppressed in the 1/6 g environment. Fig. 3.

However, since AG and lunar gravity had not been used in these studies, the effect of different loading gravities on gene expression in bone during spaceflight remains unclear. Hence, to elucidate the effects of microgravity, 1/6 g, and 1 g onboard environment on the gene expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction, eight osteoblast lineage marker genes and seven osteoclast marker genes were selected and visualized using heat mapping (Fig. 3C). We compared the expression levels of osteoblast markers Bglap, Bmp4, Sost, and Spp1, which are mainly expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone and regulate osteoblastic bone formation. The expressions of Sost, Bmp4, and Spp1 were significantly higher in MG mice than those in 1GC mice. However, Bglap expression was significantly lower in MG mice than that in 1GC, and tended to be lower than that in AG mice. In addition, these changes were absent when comparing 4GC and 4PG mice in the MHU-4 mission (Fig. 3D). Changes in Bglap expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction and the plasma concentrations of its product, osteocalcin, were similar between the experimental groups (Fig. 2C). Though bone loss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of some osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. A recent study using medaka fish showed that osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity22. Therefore, the gene upregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight. In contrast, Bglap expression was significantly downregulated under microgravity. In a previous 14-day space experiment, murine osteoblasts showed reduced expression of transcription factors and proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation23. This suggests potential negative regulation of gene expression for osteoblast differentiation during spaceflight, following an initial phase of upregulation. In summary, osteoblast-related genes may undergo distinct regulatory mechanisms contingent on the specific phase of spaceflight. Further, the expressions of osteoclast marker genes, Acp5 and Ctsk, both of which are specifically expressed by osteoclasts, regulate osteoclastic bone resorption, were significantly upregulated in MG mice compared to those in GC mice, and these changes were partially suppressed in PG mice (Fig. 3E). The changes in Acp5 expression between the experimental groups were similar to those in the plasma levels of TRAP, the product of Acp5. Thus, the expressions of osteoblast and osteoclast markers were significantly altered in the bone under microgravity, and these changes were mostly suppressed under AG and 1/6 g, suggesting that the bone is highly sensitive to gravitational alterations.The thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not prevent weight loss Following spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy24–26, and findings of the MHU-1 mission also suggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in a microgravity environment, and artificial 1 g partially prevents this decrease14. In MHU-1, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in AG mice was reduced to 79.8% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, AG; 1.38 ± 0.14) of that in 1GC mice, and that in MG mice was reduced to 56.6% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, MG; 0.98 ± 0.17) of that in 1GC mice. In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in PG mice in MHU-4 and -5 decreased to 76.4% (4GC; 1.44 ± 0.17, 4PG; 1.10 ± 0.22) and 79.2% (5GC; 1.49 ± 0.14, 5PG; 1.18 ± 0.04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that 1/6 g and artificial 1 g partially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig. 4A). Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing in a 1/6 g environment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4B). This confirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our previous study14. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin-5 (Krt5; a marker for the medullary region) and keratin-8 (Krt-8; a marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU-1 MG mice showed that Krt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region14. In the present study, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions in PG mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire (a transcription factor expressed in the medullary region), Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1; a marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their expression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-114. Thus, the abnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary, 1/6 g and artificial 1 g partially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the microgravity environment. Fig. 4.

(E) Gene ontology analysis of genes in each cluster.Gene expression in the thymus under different gravitational loads RNA-seq analysis was performed to determine the effects of different gravitational environments on gene expression. A total of 2880 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, subsequently revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 4D). Horizontal clustering between mice classified them into 1 g group (1GC, 4GC, 5GC, and AG) and less than 1 g group (4PG, 5PG, and MG). Furthermore, even in the 1 g environment, the space experiment (AG) and GC experiments (1GC, 4GC, 5GC) were classified into different groups. This may reflect changes in the process of the space experiment and GC experiment. GO analysis further revealed that cluster 1, which was downregulated in PG and MG mice compared to that in GCs, contained genes associated with endothelial morphogenesis (Fig. 4E). Consistently, altered localization of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor has been reported in human CD34+ stem cells under simulated microgravity27. Cluster 3 and 4 indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in GCs; particularly genes included in cluster 4 were only upregulated in MG mice. Clusters 3 and 4 included genes associated with cell migration. Thymic atrophy is caused by various physiological stressors, including aging and infections28–30. Previous studies using protozoan-infected mice have demonstrated thymic atrophy, wherein T cells migrate from the thymus to peripheral lymphoid organs31. Similarly, the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g may potentially induce the release of several molecular ligands that control cell migration and contribute to the establishment of thymic atrophy. Cluster 2 and 5, downregulated in MG mice, comprised genes associated with the cell cycle. RNA-seq analysis of the thymus from two independent flight experiments, MHU-1 and -2, has revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the two missions owing to differences in flight schedules and conditions14. Nevertheless, integrated results have shown an impact on cell cycle progression without significant signs of apoptosis enhancement in relatively long-duration spaceflight14. Consistently, apoptosis did not influence any of the five clusters. Moreover, our results implied the influence of cell cycle-regulating genes in clusters 2 and 5. Cluster 2 is downregulated in MG, but not in PG mice, suggesting that it contributes to the suppressing thymic weight loss in 1/6 g. Cluster 5 showed different gene expression profiles between 4 and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage. Interestingly, the cell cycle may be affected by slight changes in gravity. Changes in gene expression in the mouse thymus due to hypergravity are inhibited by a surgical lesion in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear32. The simultaneous exposure of human fibroblasts to simulated microgravity and radiation exhibits more pronounced effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes than those with radiation exposure alone33. Hence, our results demonstrated the effect of gravity on the cell cycle in the space experiment by comparing the PG and MG mice. Additionally, osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs have been reported during hindlimb unloading34. Therefore, it is critical to determine the cancer risk associated with changes in gravity. Future studies using other gravity loads will clarify the risks of thymus atrophy and carcinogenesis during spaceflight. Our previous study implied that artificial 1 g can alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice experiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation14. In this study, we showed that 1/6 g could alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression profiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that 1/6 g is still insufficient to attenuate all changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify a gravity threshold that can prevent gene expression changes in space. In summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be involved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression.The effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity The spleen is an important secondary lymphoid organ involved in the acquired immune responses during spaceflight35. Our previous study implied that erythrocyte-related genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA1 are significantly downregulated in the spleen of MG mice in the MHU-1 mission13. To elucidate the effect of 1/6 g on secondary lymphoid organs, we analyzed the histological and gene expression changes in the spleen. Body weight-normalized spleen weights in MG mice tended to be lower than those in GC mice; the spleen weights of PG mice partially recovered from the reduction observed in MG mice (Fig. 5A). Our previous HE staining results showed that MG and PG mice have a normal splenic structure with white and red pulps (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, no specific abnormalities are observed in immunostaining with Ter119 (erythrocyte marker), B220 (B cell marker), and CD3e (T cell marker), similar to those reported previously in MG mice13 (Fig. 5C).

FDR-corrected P values were calculated at P < 0.05 (CLC MW, Empirical analysis of DGE tool). ***P < 0.001.RNA-seq analysis of the spleen was performed to comprehensively investigate the impact of different gravitational forces on gene expression. A total of 94 genes (FDR < 0.05) between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 5D). These genes were also classified by horizontal clustering into mice experiencing spaceflight (5PG, MG, and AG) and mice in the ground control (1GC, 4GC, and 5GC), indicating that the general gene expression changes in the spleen were caused by the space environment and experimental processes rather than by gravity changes. Although difficult to comprehend, data from 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant factors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in the spleen. Therefore, we further compared gene expressions among 4PG, 5PG, MG, and AG mice to elucidate the effects of different gravitational loads. A total of 167 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and AG mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing three distinct clusters (Fig. 5E). Horizontal clustering classified them into 1 g (AG) and less than 1 g (4PG, 5PG, and MG) groups, indicating that PG mice showed gene expression patterns similar to those of MG mice. GO analysis also suggested that cluster 2, with upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice, included genes associated with the inflammatory response (Supplementary Fig. 2). In cluster 3, upregulation was observed only in MG mice, suggesting that 1/6 g could partially alleviate the gene expression changes in microgravity. We further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes, regulated by Gata1 and Tal1, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments13. Moreover, experiments in Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by flight-related stress but by other space-specific factors36. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces on erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated by Gata1 and Tal1 (Fig. 5F). All genes were downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice. Furthermore, we compared the expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2, and Rhag, which are known to regress after spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression36 (Fig. 5G). The expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, and Hba-a2 were significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either AG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis-related genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during spaceflight37. Although we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study has several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second day after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the RNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the 1 g environment. Although space experiments must address various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as a resource for future research. In conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g in the bone, thymus, and spleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity were not completely alleviated in 1/6 g. In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around 1/6 g, considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic abnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were used to generate 1/6 g in MHU-4 and -5, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity loads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions. This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration.Methods Mice C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for the space experiments and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for ground control experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B for MHU-1, No. 018-011D for MHU-4, and No. 018-036D for MHU-5); Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010A for MHU-1, No. EB19-003 for MHU-4, and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5); and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1 for MHU-1, No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4, and No. JAXA MHU-5/ FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). The experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America and complied with the ARRIVE guidelines.MHU missions Figure 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1 present an overview of the three MHU missions and two kinds of centrifuges, MARS-S and MARS-L. The detailed design of the three MHU missions has been previously published19. In all the MHU missions, 8–9-week-old C57BL/6J male mice in a TCU were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the HCU, one mouse per cage, and then housed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35, 25, and 26 days for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively. MHU-1 mission: Twelve C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-9 on June 18, 2016, from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. The mice were divided into two groups, AG and MG mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1 g environment (1 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 77 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-4 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-17 on May 7, 2019, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-S group was kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment (1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 31 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-5 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-20 on March 10, 2020, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-L group was kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment (1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 21 rpm) in a MARS-L centrifuge. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. Experiments on the GC group in each mission were conducted at the JAXA Laboratory in Japan a few months after the space experiments were completed. Six age-matched (8- or 9-weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice per mission were used, and the time spent in the TCU or HCU was the same for each space experiment. Phenotypic analyses for all three missions were conducted by the same researchers. Unavoidably, it took approximately 2, 1.2, and 2.3 days of transport time for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively, after return to Earth for initiating the experimental analysis at Explora Biolabs.The return phase and animal dissection After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach (Supplementary Fig. 1). JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for further analysis. The health conditions of the mice were checked and their body weights were measured. Subsequently, the mid-air righting reflex test was performed. Each mouse oriented in the supine position was dropped twice from a height of approximately 40 cm above the padded surface, and the average time for righting was analyzed using high-speed video (DSC-RX100M5, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The rotarod performance test was performed after the righting reflex test. First, the mouse was placed on a rod rotating at a speed of 2 rpm to acclimate it, and the experiment began when the mouse was able to stay on the rod (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan). The rotation speed of the rod was accelerated from 2 to 40 rpm in 2 min using a ramping acceleration mode. The time each mouse could stay on the rod was measured. For each mouse, the rotor test was performed three times, and the average of the last two tests was used as the data for each mouse. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized using exsanguination and dissected to collect tissue samples. Samples that required cryopreservation were transported by air in a refrigerated box containing dry ice. The journey from the laboratory where the dissections were performed in the USA to JAXA’s laboratory in Japan took several days in all instances (MHU-1, 4.0 days; MHU-4, 7.5 days; MHU-5, 5.5 days), and temperature changes during that time were checked using temperature data loggers.Micro-computed tomography analysis After fixation with 70% ethanol, distal regions of the femur were analyzed. Micro-computed tomography scanning was performed using a ScanXmate-A100S Scanner (Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan). Reconstructed three-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to previously published guidelines38 using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm3), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, µm), trabecular bone number (Tb.N, /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp, µm; intervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th, µm), and cross-sectional area of cortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm2) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. A percentage of the trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in the trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm3) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm3) were measured with a bone mineral quantification phantom.Measurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin Plasma levels of TRAP and osteocalcin were measured with MouseTRAP™ (TRAcP 5b) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, UK), and Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.Isolation of bone tissues Bone tissues were prepared as previously described with modifications20. Connective tissues and the periosteum of femurs and tibiae were removed, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After bone marrow cells were removed from the diaphyses of femurs and tibiae by flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the bones were incubated with 1 mg/mL collagenase and 2 mg/mL dispase in alpha-minimum essential medium at 37 °C for 20 min, and then treated using a micro-interdental brush. The remaining bone was used as an osteocyte-enriched bone. The bones were collected in TRIZOL reagent and ground into a powder using a tissue pulverizer (Minilys, Bertin Technologies, France) for total RNA extraction.RNA-sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA depletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 36 bases) was performed using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 10.1.1; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as the total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with 0 counts in all samples and genes with total lead counts of 5 or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of DGE tool (edgeR)39 in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21.0.3; Qiagen). Differentially expressed genes were extracted among the conditions (MHU-1_GC vs. MHU-1_MG, MHU-4_4GC vs. MHU-4_4PG, and MHU-5_5GC vs. MHU-5_5PG) with FDR-corrected P < 0.05.Gene functional analysis The clustering heatmap was generated in Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). GO analysis of each cluster was performed using the Enrichr webtool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/).Histological and immunostaining of tissue sections For histological analysis, the spleen and thymus were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of 5-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides and subjected to HE staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, the spleen and thymus were snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan). Frozen sections of 6-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides coated with amino silane. After fixing with ice-cold acetone for 5 min, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then treated with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3e (BioLegend; 100236, 1:200), anti-CD45R (B220, BioLegend; 103228, 1:400), anti-TER119 (BioLegend; 116203, 1:300), anti-Keratin 5 (Krt5; Biolegend 905503, 1:500), and Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-Keratin 8 (Krt8; Abcam ab192467, 1:50) antibodies, Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-mouse Aire antibody (eBioscience; 53-5934-82, 1:500), and Biotin-labeled UEA-1 (Vector laboratories; B-1065-2, 1:50) in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 1 h at 24 °C, after washing, and further incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen; A-11035, 1:500) Alexa Flour 546-labeled Streptavidin (Invitrogen; S11225, 1:500) for 1 h at 24 °C, the sections were covered with glass coverslips using a mounting solution. Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope. At least three different sections were analyzed for each sample (Leica, SP8).Statistical analyses All data are presented as the mean of biological replicates and dots of the individual sample data. Comparisons between groups (excluding RNA-seq analysis, as explained previously) were performed using appropriate statistical tests for each data set. Tests for normal distribution were carried out using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student’s t-test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Non-normally distributed data were tested using the Mann–Whitney U test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.Supplementary Information Supplementary Figure 1. (559.9KB, pdf) Supplementary Figure 2.

    "abstract": "Detergent-induced rearrangements of membrane-protein subunits explain why two MscL channel stoichiometries have been resolved by X-ray crystallography - but S. aureus MscL is truly a pentamer in vivo.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological “emergency release valve,” allowing rapid loss of solutes in response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacterium's environment [1]. It is perhaps the best characterized mechanosensor [2], thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces [3]. Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiometry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits [4]. This model then appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional crystallization of EcoMscL [5]. But the subsequent elucidation of the M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography [6] then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for this orthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry [6],[7], which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystallization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry. Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was most likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant [8]. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore, we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and MtMscL [8], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Purification SaMscL (accession number: CAG43065) was expressed using the pET21a vector in PB116 E. coli cells grown to O.D.600 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2–3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested and stored at −80°C until needed. Cells containing SaMscL were lysed in 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 µg/ml DNAse, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 150 µl protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a French press at 16K PSI at 4°C. The cell lysate was incubated with 40 mM n-Decyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) for 1 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 24,000× g for 30 min at 4°C to clarify the lysate. 4 mM imidazol was added to the resulting supernatant and then bound to 4 ml of Ni-NTA slury pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 40 mM DM for 1 h at 4°C. Standard metal affinity chromatography was performed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazol, 4 mM DM, and SaMscL was eluted with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazol, and 4 mM DM. The purest protein fractions were combined and concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon). Detergent exchange was accomplished by adding 40 mM Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) or 5% (w/v) pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) to the concentrated SaMscL and allowing the protein-detergent complex to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. The following day the protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5% (w/v) C8E5. The eluting peak was collected and concentrated using a 50,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon) and used for either sedimentation equilibrium experiments or size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering experiments (SEC-MALS). Crosslinking SaMscL and EcoMscL were cloned into pB10 and pET21a vectors and transformed into PB104 or PB116 E. coli and purified as previously described [10]. 2% Triton X-100 or 44 mM LDAO was used for MscL extraction with a final concentration of 0.2% and 2.1 mM, respectively, after purification. For crosslinking reactions 5 µg of protein was incubated with 2 mM DSS (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with a final concentration of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 for 15 min at room temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were brought up in non-reducing sample buffer, were loaded on a Criterion 4–20% gel, and were subjected to Western as previously described [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1∶4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1∶100,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1∶100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper phenanthroline) at a 1∶20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were spun down at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re-suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a 4%–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1∶4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1∶40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. SEC-MALS A Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system equipped with a Shodex KW-803 SEC column was connected in line with a miniDAWN-TREOS light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technologies) and Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). The light scattering and refractive index instruments were calibrated following the manufacturer's guidelines, and 40 ml of running buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5% (w/v) C8E5) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and establish stable baselines for the light scattering and refractive index instruments. 25–75 µg of purified protein was used for each SEC-MALS experiment, and data were collected using ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technologies) and processed following the manufacturer's guidelines. LDAO and C8E5 dn/dc values (0.1490 and 0.1240, respectively) were measured using the Optilab rEX following the manufacturer's guidelines and the SaMscL extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Buffer density-matching experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge to identify the appropriate solution density to match the density of the C8E5 detergent. Volumes of 180 µL of solutions containing 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) C8E5, and various concentrations of NaCl were placed in the sample sector of a dual-sectored, charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter; all AUC experiments were carried out in such centerpieces) that was sandwiched between sapphire windows. Identical buffers without detergent were placed in the reference sector. The centrifugation cells were centrifuged at a temperature of 25°C and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm; an An-50Ti rotor was used for all centrifugation experiments. The formation of any detergent concentration gradient was monitored using interference optics. C8E5 was found to be neutrally buoyant in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, which was then used for all sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments with 0.5% C8E5 at 25°C. 4, 8, 40, and 80 µM SaMscL samples were prepared and loaded into the assembled ultracentrifuge cells; buffer with detergent was deposited in the reference sector. Long solution columns (180 µL) were also used in this experiment. Centrifugation was performed at 25°C at 9,500, 14,000, and 17,500 rpm. The data were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT [23] was used to fit the sedimentation equilibrium data to a single species model. Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was performed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data [23]. A 68.3% confidence interval was calculated as previously described [24],[25]. The error number reported is the average of the positive and negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein (δD), buffer without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two different concentrations (41 and 66 µM) of MscL were placed in the sample sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 µl. The rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was 20°C. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting discrete species model [26],[27]. The flotation of the detergent micelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was explicitly accounted for by giving that species a negative sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units and interference fringes present for the main sedimenting species were derived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments of the detergent and the protein, δD was calculated as in le Maire et al. [28]. Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with 20, 32, and 64 µM SaMscL samples in 4 mM LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20°C. The volume centrifuged was 390 µL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same [LDAO] as the sample. The absorbance data (interference data were not collected) were initially analyzed using the c(s) model in SEDFIT [26]. Although LDAO has a very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near to the meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In these analyses, small quantities (2%–3% of the total signal) of large species were detected. Using this information, all species, including the floating detergent, were modeled in the “species analysis” model in SEDPHAT [26]. This approach is referred to as the “s and D” method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient and the diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molar mass (Mb). Mb was transformed to M (the molar mass of the protein) using the formula (1) where (2) [29] The symbol ρ is the solution density, is the partial specific volume of the protein, and is the partial specific volume of the detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in these calculations. Mb was also calculated using the relationship (3) where N 0 is Avogadro's number, η is the solution viscosity, Rs is the Stokes radius of the protein/detergent complex, and s is the sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein was obtained by calibrating the SEC column described above with proteins of known Stokes radius. Rs for SaMscL in LDAO was 4.2 nm. Again, Mb was transformed to M using Eq. 1. Values for , η, and ρ were estimated using the program SEDNTERP [30]. The value of was taken as 1.13 mL/g [31]. Confidence intervals of s and Mb were calculated as detailed above. A confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which was derived from a linear regression, was: where t is the t statistic, ss is the estimate of σ for the regression line, Ve is the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, is the average elution volume of the standards, n is the number of standards, and SVV is the sum of squared deviations of the individual standard compared to . In cases of asymmetric error intervals, the σ was taken as the average of the difference between the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multiple experiments, each having different errors, were performed, the value of M reported in the main text is the weighted mean μw ± the weighted σ (σ w), calculated using the formulas: for the I experiments preformed (i = 3 in this case).",
    "results": "Results With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures (Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described [9],[10]. Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and then immediately resuspended in SDS loading buffer to avoid unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously observed [9], osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presumably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell [11], thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10C/L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10C/M91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the true structural and functional unit in vivo. Figure 1. S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in the cell membrane. Open in a new tab (A) Two orientations of the SaMscL and MtMscL crystal structures are shown with the molecules viewed from the periplasmic side (top) and from the lipid bilayer (bottom). The locations of the residues used to perform the in vivo disulfide crosslinking experiments are highlighted on the structures in surface representation: blue represents L10 (SaMscL) and A10 (MtMscL), orange represents T89 (SaMscL) and T96 (MtMscL), and red represents M91 (SaMscL) and R98 (MtMscL). (B) Western blot analysis of L10C/L89C and L10C/M91C SaMscL channels after in vivo disulfide bond trapping using copper-phenanthroline in both osmotically shocked (S+) and non-shocked (NS) samples. With SaMscL pentamers being the predominant oligomeric state in the cell membrane, we wanted to understand why SaMscL crystallized as a tetramer. We began by confirming the previously observed pentameric and tetrameric states of MscL by performing crosslinking experiments of purified EcoMscL and SaMscL, visualizing their oligomeric state by Western blot analysis (Figure 2). Five crosslinked EcoMscL products were observed, consistent with previous reports showing that EcoMscL is a pentamer [6],[7]. In contrast with previous findings [8], SaMscL also presented five crosslinked products, suggesting that SaMscL also exists in a pentameric oligomeric state. No difference was observed between proteins expressed by a high-expressing plasmid (pET) and those encoded a moderate-expressing plasmid (pB10), demonstrating that expressions levels have no effect on MscL oligomerization. To substantiate these results, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE) was performed to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel. The results for SaMscL were fit to a single-species model and yielded a molar mass of 71.2 kDa, consistent with a pentameric subunit organization (SaMscL theoretical pentameric molar mass is 72.2 kDa) (Figure 3A, B). As a third independent method to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments [12]. Analysis of nine independent SEC-MALS experiments resulted in an average calculated SaMscL mass of 72.8±0.8 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 9), again consistent with a pentameric subunit organization of SaMscL (representative experiment shown in Figure 3C). Figure 2. E. coli and S. aureus MscL are pentameric multimers by crosslinking. Open in a new tab Western blot analysis of DSS-treated E. coli-MscL (Eco) and S. aureus-MscL (Sa) expressed with either the pET21a (pET) or pB10 vector show five distinct bands at both expression levels. Molecular weight markers are shown to the left of the blot and the approximate location of monomers (1×) to pentamers (5×) is shown between the blots. The right-hand blot shows a separate experiment where the majority of the EcoMscL and the SaMscL protein are in the pentameric and monomeric forms. Figure 3. Purified S. aureus MscL is pentameric by equilibrium sedimentation centrifugation and SEC-MALS. Open in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation was performed on 40 µM SaMscL in the neutrally buoyant detergent C8E5. The upper two panels in (A) and (B) show scans from three different rotor speeds monitored at either 250 nm (A) or 280 nm (B). The lines represent fits to the data of a single species model that yield a calculated protein mass of 71.2 kDa with a local rmsd of 0.005799 (A) and 0.005059 (B) (SaMscL monomer mass is 14.4 kDa; pentamer mass is 72.2 kDa). The lower two panels in (A) and (B) show the residuals from the data fitting. A representative SEC-MALS experiment of SaMscL in C8E5 is shown in (C) with the UV chromatogram colored blue and the 90° light scattering chromatogram colored red. The total computed mass is shown as the black line across the elution peak, with the SaMscL and C8E5 mass shown in green and orange, respectively. The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 show three independent approaches that all confirm the pentameric oligomeric state of SaMscL, in agreement with our in vivo crosslinking results. These data are also consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6],[13] and biochemical studies of EcoMscL [7] but inconsistent with the subunit organization in the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. The major difference in the protein handling between our experiments and those previously published for the SaMscL channel [8] was the choice of solubilizing detergent. Our measurements were made in the presence of either Triton X-100 (crosslinking) or pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergent (SE and SEC-MALS), not Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), the detergent used previously to crystallize SaMscL and evaluate its oligomeric state [8]. To determine if the solubilizing detergent could account for the discrepancies in the data, we tested whether LDAO may affect the oligomeric state of SaMscL. We performed SaMscL crosslinking experiments in the presence of LDAO and found essentially no crosslinked pentamer and a substantial increase in tetramers when compared to the experiments performed in Triton X-100 (Figure 4A). To confirm that LDAO was altering the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel rather than simply affecting our crosslinking efficiency, we directly measured the mass of the SaMscL protein in the presence of LDAO by SEC-MALS (representative experiment shown in Figure 4B). The results show that the average protein mass in the presence of LDAO is 60.0±2.8 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 8), a mass that is dramatically reduced compared to the C8E5 experiments (72.8±0.8 kDa) and that is consistent with a tetrameric oligomeric state (theoretical SaMscL tetramer is 57.8 kDa). As a third independent approach to assess the oligomeric state of the protein, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on the SaMscL protein in LDAO. Two different methods were used to calculate the molar mass of the protein from these data (see Methods for details). Both resulted in similar values: 62.3±1.3 kDa (“s and D” method, Figure 4C) and 64±3 kDa (“Stokes radius” method) (Weighted Ave ± 1σ). These results again show a protein molar mass well below that of a pentamer, consistent with LDAO affecting the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel. Figure 4. LDAO stabilizes a MscL tetrameric oligomeric state as measured by crosslinking, SEC-MALS, and Sedimentation Velocity Centrifugation. Open in a new tab (A) Western blot analysis of DSS-treated SaMscL solubilized with either Triton-X100 or LDAO yield different quantities of tetramers and pentamers. (B) A representative SEC-MALS experiment of SaMscL in LDAO is shown with the UV chromatogram colored blue and the 90° light scattering chromatogram colored red. The total, SaMscL, and LDAO masses are shown as black, green, and orange lines across the elution peak, respectively. The mass of the SaMscL monomer is 14.4 kDa and the tetramer mass is 57.8 kDa. (C) SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was subjected to sedimentation velocity centrifugation at 50,000 rpm, and the data were analyzed using the noninteracting “species model” of SEDPHAT. Four species, including the detergent micelles, were analyzed. The molar mass of the dominant sedimenting species was 62.5 kDa. In the upper part, the individual data points are depicted as circles, and the best-fit model to those data is shown as lines. The data and fit lines are color coded by color: Violet for the earliest scans, then progressing through indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red as the scans go further forward in time. For clarity only every other scan used in the data analysis is shown. In the lower part, the residuals between the data points and the fitted line are shown and color coded as above. We also tested the reversibility of this oligomeric state reorganization by using SaMscL purified in LDAO and then exchanged the LDAO detergent for C8E5. This protocol resulted in the SaMscL mass increasing from 61.4±0.7 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 3) to 72.0±2.6 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 4) as measured by SEC-MALS (Figure 5). The choice of initial detergent made no difference in the reversibility, as purifying SaMscL in C8E5 and then exchanging the detergent for LDAO showed a mass decrease from 72.2±0.5 kDa in C8E5 (Ave ± SD, n = 5) to 58.7±0.7 kDa in LDAO (Ave ± SD, n = 3). Hence, the oligomeric rearrangement is reversible and is completely dependent upon the detergent solubilizing the MscL protein. Figure 5. The S. aureus MscL stoichiometry change is reversible. Open in a new tab (A) The oligomeric state of SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was determined using SEC-MALS, which measured a protein mass of 61.3 kDa, consistent with a tetrameric channel (top chromatogram). (B) The SaMscL-LDAO sample was exchanged into C8E5, and the following day the oligomeric state of SaMscL-C8E5 sample was measured by SEC-MALS. Analysis of the SEC-MALS results for the SaMscL-C8E5 sample showed a protein mass of 74.4 kDa, consistent with the channel in a pentameric state.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alter the subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far-reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed an in vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the major product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lack of disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient (e.g. see [9],[10]). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that oligomerization is a dynamic and even reversible process in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric species smaller than pentamers have a physiological role given that there are tens of channels per cell [14], and the smaller species compose only a few percent of the total channels. Our data definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channel adopts a pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6], but incompatible with the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. A close inspection of the recent tetrameric SaMscL structure, which was speculated to be in an expanded gating intermediate state, reveals structural interactions between residues in TM1 and TM2 residues of a neighboring subunit similar to those in the closed MtMscL structure. This result was surprising because several studies using various techniques have suggested TM1 undergoes a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies [15], accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating [16],[17], accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in the pore [18], suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions between TM1 and TM2 upon gating [19], and confirmation of multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating by using an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide trapping [10]. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model, V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away from the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore. The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred strongly suggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects a strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than an expanded intermediate state. The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into physiological multimeric complexes. A previous report on EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequently purified in the presence of Triton X-100, the channel spontaneously assembles into pentamers [20]. A separate study demonstrated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomerize into functional channels when incorporated into lipid membranes [21]. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functional oligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C8E5 and Triton X-100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into a pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligomeric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. The observed self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent-induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain why Liu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized SaMscL tetramers [8]; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO-solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges back into functional pentameric structures. The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from a truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the C-terminus had been removed [8]. One previous study suggested that at least some C-terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formation of larger aggregates when translated in a cell-free system [22]. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, our data do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution. Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger, more hydrated head groups (i.e. the head groups of C8E5 and Triton X-100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head groups (i.e. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, with such a small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is a pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause a reorganization of the SaMscL channel's oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of a particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins.",

Copyright notice ID: 2998437 PMID: 21151884 Detergent-induced rearrangements of membrane-protein subunits explain why two MscL channel stoichiometries have been resolved by X-ray crystallography - but S. aureus MscL is truly a pentamer in vivo.Abstract While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.Author Summary The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. One of the primary ways that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive channels, and mechanosensation is so vital that essentially all organisms have at least one such sensor. Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issue of how many subunits it has is hotly debated. There are even two published crystal structures showing either tetrameric or pentameric complexes. Here we show that the channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that the detergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the complexes from pentamers to tetramers. The finding that detergents can have such a profound effect on structure may have broad implications for the study of other membrane proteins.Introduction The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological “emergency release valve,” allowing rapid loss of solutes in response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacterium's environment [1]. It is perhaps the best characterized mechanosensor [2], thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces [3]. Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiometry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits [4]. This model then appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional crystallization of EcoMscL [5]. But the subsequent elucidation of the M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography [6] then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for this orthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry [6],[7], which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystallization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry. Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was most likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant [8]. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore, we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and MtMscL [8], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry.Results With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures (Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described [9],[10]. Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and then immediately resuspended in SDS loading buffer to avoid unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously observed [9], osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presumably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell [11], thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10C/L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10C/M91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the true structural and functional unit in vivo. Figure 1. S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in the cell membrane. Open in a new tab (A) Two orientations of the SaMscL and MtMscL crystal structures are shown with the molecules viewed from the periplasmic side (top) and from the lipid bilayer (bottom). The locations of the residues used to perform the in vivo disulfide crosslinking experiments are highlighted on the structures in surface representation: blue represents L10 (SaMscL) and A10 (MtMscL), orange represents T89 (SaMscL) and T96 (MtMscL), and red represents M91 (SaMscL) and R98 (MtMscL). (B) Western blot analysis of L10C/L89C and L10C/M91C SaMscL channels after in vivo disulfide bond trapping using copper-phenanthroline in both osmotically shocked (S+) and non-shocked (NS) samples.With SaMscL pentamers being the predominant oligomeric state in the cell membrane, we wanted to understand why SaMscL crystallized as a tetramer. We began by confirming the previously observed pentameric and tetrameric states of MscL by performing crosslinking experiments of purified EcoMscL and SaMscL, visualizing their oligomeric state by Western blot analysis (Figure 2). Five crosslinked EcoMscL products were observed, consistent with previous reports showing that EcoMscL is a pentamer [6],[7]. In contrast with previous findings [8], SaMscL also presented five crosslinked products, suggesting that SaMscL also exists in a pentameric oligomeric state. No difference was observed between proteins expressed by a high-expressing plasmid (pET) and those encoded a moderate-expressing plasmid (pB10), demonstrating that expressions levels have no effect on MscL oligomerization. To substantiate these results, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE) was performed to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel. The results for SaMscL were fit to a single-species model and yielded a molar mass of 71.2 kDa, consistent with a pentameric subunit organization (SaMscL theoretical pentameric molar mass is 72.2 kDa) (Figure 3A, B). As a third independent method to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments [12]. Analysis of nine independent SEC-MALS experiments resulted in an average calculated SaMscL mass of 72.8±0.8 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 9), again consistent with a pentameric subunit organization of SaMscL (representative experiment shown in Figure 3C). Figure 2. E. coli and S. aureus MscL are pentameric multimers by crosslinking. Open in a new tab Western blot analysis of DSS-treated E. coli-MscL (Eco) and S. aureus-MscL (Sa) expressed with either the pET21a (pET) or pB10 vector show five distinct bands at both expression levels. Molecular weight markers are shown to the left of the blot and the approximate location of monomers (1×) to pentamers (5×) is shown between the blots. The right-hand blot shows a separate experiment where the majority of the EcoMscL and the SaMscL protein are in the pentameric and monomeric forms.Figure 3. Purified S. aureus MscL is pentameric by equilibrium sedimentation centrifugation and SEC-MALS. Open in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation was performed on 40 µM SaMscL in the neutrally buoyant detergent C8E5. The upper two panels in (A) and (B) show scans from three different rotor speeds monitored at either 250 nm (A) or 280 nm (B). The lines represent fits to the data of a single species model that yield a calculated protein mass of 71.2 kDa with a local rmsd of 0.005799 (A) and 0.005059 (B) (SaMscL monomer mass is 14.4 kDa; pentamer mass is 72.2 kDa). The lower two panels in (A) and (B) show the residuals from the data fitting. A representative SEC-MALS experiment of SaMscL in C8E5 is shown in (C) with the UV chromatogram colored blue and the 90° light scattering chromatogram colored red. The total computed mass is shown as the black line across the elution peak, with the SaMscL and C8E5 mass shown in green and orange, respectively.The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 show three independent approaches that all confirm the pentameric oligomeric state of SaMscL, in agreement with our in vivo crosslinking results. These data are also consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6],[13] and biochemical studies of EcoMscL [7] but inconsistent with the subunit organization in the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. The major difference in the protein handling between our experiments and those previously published for the SaMscL channel [8] was the choice of solubilizing detergent. Our measurements were made in the presence of either Triton X-100 (crosslinking) or pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergent (SE and SEC-MALS), not Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), the detergent used previously to crystallize SaMscL and evaluate its oligomeric state [8]. To determine if the solubilizing detergent could account for the discrepancies in the data, we tested whether LDAO may affect the oligomeric state of SaMscL. We performed SaMscL crosslinking experiments in the presence of LDAO and found essentially no crosslinked pentamer and a substantial increase in tetramers when compared to the experiments performed in Triton X-100 (Figure 4A). To confirm that LDAO was altering the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel rather than simply affecting our crosslinking efficiency, we directly measured the mass of the SaMscL protein in the presence of LDAO by SEC-MALS (representative experiment shown in Figure 4B). The results show that the average protein mass in the presence of LDAO is 60.0±2.8 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 8), a mass that is dramatically reduced compared to the C8E5 experiments (72.8±0.8 kDa) and that is consistent with a tetrameric oligomeric state (theoretical SaMscL tetramer is 57.8 kDa). As a third independent approach to assess the oligomeric state of the protein, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on the SaMscL protein in LDAO. Two different methods were used to calculate the molar mass of the protein from these data (see Methods for details). Both resulted in similar values: 62.3±1.3 kDa (“s and D” method, Figure 4C) and 64±3 kDa (“Stokes radius” method) (Weighted Ave ± 1σ). These results again show a protein molar mass well below that of a pentamer, consistent with LDAO affecting the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel. Figure 4. LDAO stabilizes a MscL tetrameric oligomeric state as measured by crosslinking, SEC-MALS, and Sedimentation Velocity Centrifugation. Open in a new tab (A) Western blot analysis of DSS-treated SaMscL solubilized with either Triton-X100 or LDAO yield different quantities of tetramers and pentamers. (B) A representative SEC-MALS experiment of SaMscL in LDAO is shown with the UV chromatogram colored blue and the 90° light scattering chromatogram colored red. The total, SaMscL, and LDAO masses are shown as black, green, and orange lines across the elution peak, respectively. The mass of the SaMscL monomer is 14.4 kDa and the tetramer mass is 57.8 kDa. (C) SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was subjected to sedimentation velocity centrifugation at 50,000 rpm, and the data were analyzed using the noninteracting “species model” of SEDPHAT. Four species, including the detergent micelles, were analyzed. The molar mass of the dominant sedimenting species was 62.5 kDa. In the upper part, the individual data points are depicted as circles, and the best-fit model to those data is shown as lines. The data and fit lines are color coded by color: Violet for the earliest scans, then progressing through indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red as the scans go further forward in time. For clarity only every other scan used in the data analysis is shown. In the lower part, the residuals between the data points and the fitted line are shown and color coded as above.We also tested the reversibility of this oligomeric state reorganization by using SaMscL purified in LDAO and then exchanged the LDAO detergent for C8E5. This protocol resulted in the SaMscL mass increasing from 61.4±0.7 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 3) to 72.0±2.6 kDa (Ave ± SD, n = 4) as measured by SEC-MALS (Figure 5). The choice of initial detergent made no difference in the reversibility, as purifying SaMscL in C8E5 and then exchanging the detergent for LDAO showed a mass decrease from 72.2±0.5 kDa in C8E5 (Ave ± SD, n = 5) to 58.7±0.7 kDa in LDAO (Ave ± SD, n = 3). Hence, the oligomeric rearrangement is reversible and is completely dependent upon the detergent solubilizing the MscL protein. Figure 5. The S. aureus MscL stoichiometry change is reversible. Open in a new tab (A) The oligomeric state of SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was determined using SEC-MALS, which measured a protein mass of 61.3 kDa, consistent with a tetrameric channel (top chromatogram). (B) The SaMscL-LDAO sample was exchanged into C8E5, and the following day the oligomeric state of SaMscL-C8E5 sample was measured by SEC-MALS. Analysis of the SEC-MALS results for the SaMscL-C8E5 sample showed a protein mass of 74.4 kDa, consistent with the channel in a pentameric state.Discussion Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alter the subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far-reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed an in vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the major product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lack of disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient (e.g. see [9],[10]). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that oligomerization is a dynamic and even reversible process in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric species smaller than pentamers have a physiological role given that there are tens of channels per cell [14], and the smaller species compose only a few percent of the total channels. Our data definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channel adopts a pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6], but incompatible with the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. A close inspection of the recent tetrameric SaMscL structure, which was speculated to be in an expanded gating intermediate state, reveals structural interactions between residues in TM1 and TM2 residues of a neighboring subunit similar to those in the closed MtMscL structure. This result was surprising because several studies using various techniques have suggested TM1 undergoes a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies [15], accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating [16],[17], accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in the pore [18], suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions between TM1 and TM2 upon gating [19], and confirmation of multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating by using an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide trapping [10]. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model, V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away from the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore. The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred strongly suggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects a strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than an expanded intermediate state. The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into physiological multimeric complexes. A previous report on EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequently purified in the presence of Triton X-100, the channel spontaneously assembles into pentamers [20]. A separate study demonstrated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomerize into functional channels when incorporated into lipid membranes [21]. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functional oligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C8E5 and Triton X-100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into a pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligomeric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. The observed self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent-induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain why Liu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized SaMscL tetramers [8]; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO-solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges back into functional pentameric structures. The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from a truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the C-terminus had been removed [8]. One previous study suggested that at least some C-terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formation of larger aggregates when translated in a cell-free system [22]. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, our data do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution. Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger, more hydrated head groups (i.e. the head groups of C8E5 and Triton X-100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head groups (i.e. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, with such a small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is a pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause a reorganization of the SaMscL channel's oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of a particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins.Materials and Methods Purification SaMscL (accession number: CAG43065) was expressed using the pET21a vector in PB116 E. coli cells grown to O.D.600 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2–3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested and stored at −80°C until needed. Cells containing SaMscL were lysed in 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 µg/ml DNAse, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 150 µl protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a French press at 16K PSI at 4°C. The cell lysate was incubated with 40 mM n-Decyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) for 1 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 24,000× g for 30 min at 4°C to clarify the lysate. 4 mM imidazol was added to the resulting supernatant and then bound to 4 ml of Ni-NTA slury pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 40 mM DM for 1 h at 4°C. Standard metal affinity chromatography was performed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazol, 4 mM DM, and SaMscL was eluted with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazol, and 4 mM DM. The purest protein fractions were combined and concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon). Detergent exchange was accomplished by adding 40 mM Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) or 5% (w/v) pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) to the concentrated SaMscL and allowing the protein-detergent complex to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. The following day the protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5% (w/v) C8E5. The eluting peak was collected and concentrated using a 50,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon) and used for either sedimentation equilibrium experiments or size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering experiments (SEC-MALS).Crosslinking SaMscL and EcoMscL were cloned into pB10 and pET21a vectors and transformed into PB104 or PB116 E. coli and purified as previously described [10]. 2% Triton X-100 or 44 mM LDAO was used for MscL extraction with a final concentration of 0.2% and 2.1 mM, respectively, after purification. For crosslinking reactions 5 µg of protein was incubated with 2 mM DSS (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with a final concentration of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 for 15 min at room temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were brought up in non-reducing sample buffer, were loaded on a Criterion 4–20% gel, and were subjected to Western as previously described [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1∶4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1∶100,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film.In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1∶100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper phenanthroline) at a 1∶20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were spun down at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re-suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a 4%–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1∶4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1∶40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film.SEC-MALS A Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system equipped with a Shodex KW-803 SEC column was connected in line with a miniDAWN-TREOS light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technologies) and Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). The light scattering and refractive index instruments were calibrated following the manufacturer's guidelines, and 40 ml of running buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5% (w/v) C8E5) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and establish stable baselines for the light scattering and refractive index instruments. 25–75 µg of purified protein was used for each SEC-MALS experiment, and data were collected using ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technologies) and processed following the manufacturer's guidelines. LDAO and C8E5 dn/dc values (0.1490 and 0.1240, respectively) were measured using the Optilab rEX following the manufacturer's guidelines and the SaMscL extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence.Analytical Ultracentrifugation Buffer density-matching experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge to identify the appropriate solution density to match the density of the C8E5 detergent. Volumes of 180 µL of solutions containing 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) C8E5, and various concentrations of NaCl were placed in the sample sector of a dual-sectored, charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter; all AUC experiments were carried out in such centerpieces) that was sandwiched between sapphire windows. Identical buffers without detergent were placed in the reference sector. The centrifugation cells were centrifuged at a temperature of 25°C and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm; an An-50Ti rotor was used for all centrifugation experiments. The formation of any detergent concentration gradient was monitored using interference optics. C8E5 was found to be neutrally buoyant in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, which was then used for all sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments with 0.5% C8E5 at 25°C. 4, 8, 40, and 80 µM SaMscL samples were prepared and loaded into the assembled ultracentrifuge cells; buffer with detergent was deposited in the reference sector. Long solution columns (180 µL) were also used in this experiment. Centrifugation was performed at 25°C at 9,500, 14,000, and 17,500 rpm. The data were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT [23] was used to fit the sedimentation equilibrium data to a single species model. Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was performed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data [23]. A 68.3% confidence interval was calculated as previously described [24],[25]. The error number reported is the average of the positive and negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein (δD), buffer without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two different concentrations (41 and 66 µM) of MscL were placed in the sample sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 µl. The rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was 20°C. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting discrete species model [26],[27]. The flotation of the detergent micelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was explicitly accounted for by giving that species a negative sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units and interference fringes present for the main sedimenting species were derived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments of the detergent and the protein, δD was calculated as in le Maire et al. [28]. Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with 20, 32, and 64 µM SaMscL samples in 4 mM LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20°C. The volume centrifuged was 390 µL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same [LDAO] as the sample. The absorbance data (interference data were not collected) were initially analyzed using the c(s) model in SEDFIT [26]. Although LDAO has a very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near to the meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In these analyses, small quantities (2%–3% of the total signal) of large species were detected. Using this information, all species, including the floating detergent, were modeled in the “species analysis” model in SEDPHAT [26]. This approach is referred to as the “s and D” method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient and the diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molar mass (Mb). Mb was transformed to M (the molar mass of the protein) using the formula (1) where (2) [29] The symbol ρ is the solution density, is the partial specific volume of the protein, and is the partial specific volume of the detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in these calculations. Mb was also calculated using the relationship (3) where N 0 is Avogadro's number, η is the solution viscosity, Rs is the Stokes radius of the protein/detergent complex, and s is the sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein was obtained by calibrating the SEC column described above with proteins of known Stokes radius. Rs for SaMscL in LDAO was 4.2 nm. Again, Mb was transformed to M using Eq. 1. Values for , η, and ρ were estimated using the program SEDNTERP [30]. The value of was taken as 1.13 mL/g [31]. Confidence intervals of s and Mb were calculated as detailed above. A confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which was derived from a linear regression, was: where t is the t statistic, ss is the estimate of σ for the regression line, Ve is the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, is the average elution volume of the standards, n is the number of standards, and SVV is the sum of squared deviations of the individual standard compared to . In cases of asymmetric error intervals, the σ was taken as the average of the difference between the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multiple experiments, each having different errors, were performed, the value of M reported in the main text is the weighted mean μw ± the weighted σ (σ w), calculated using the formulas: for the I experiments preformed (i = 3 in this case).Acknowledgments The authors thank Christina Eaton and Drs.

These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P. Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve. Keywords: osmoregulation, drug-release device, ionic preference, ionic selectivity The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is found in the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria (1), where it plays a vital role in osmoregulation by protecting the cell from lysis on acute decreases in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (2), thus serving as a biological “emergency release valve.” It has remained one of the best studied and most understood of mechanosensitive channels. A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be of simple architecture: a homopentamer, with each subunit containing 2 transmembrane α helices and a cytoplasmic α helical bundle (3). The first transmembrane domain, TM1, forms the pore of the channel, while the second transmembrane domain, TM2, is exposed to the lipid bilayer. In response to tension in cell membrane, both TM1 and TM2 expand, and this expansion ultimately leads to channel opening, with TM1 largely forming the pore lumen (4–7). Several previous studies have recognized that this channel has many properties that would make it ideal for use in vesicular-based targeted drug-release nanodevices. It has a very large pore size (30–40 Å; ref. 8); thus, when gated, the nanopore would allow large compounds to be released. Furthermore, it can be translated in vitro (9) or synthetically synthesized (10), reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex. Moreover, introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension (5, 11, 12). This approach has allowed for the engineering of controllable nanopores, or nanoswitches that detect alternative modalities, including light (13) and pH (14). To perform this technique, compounds that acquire charges in response to these stimuli are inserted chemically, by thiol reactions to unique cysteines substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, into the pore of the channel. However, a charge in the pore lumen might not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also influence the permeation of charged molecules. In this study, we used in vivo efflux assays and patch-clamp approaches to address this question. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and cell growth The MscL mutants were generated using the Mega Primer method as described previously (15). Mutants were inserted within the pB10b or pB10d expression construct, a modified pB10b plasmid (16–18). Escherichia coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm) (16) was used for in vivo assays and electrophysiological analysis. 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) and 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate sodium salt (MTSES) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (North York, ON, Canada). Spermine 4HCl and Na2-succinate were from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Agarose was from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Hercules, CA, USA). Unless indicated, cultures were routinely grown in Lennox broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NY, USA) plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cycles/min. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH, USA). In vivo efflux assaysK+ efflux assay E. coli PB104 cells were grown in K10 medium (46 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 10 mM KCl, pH 7) supplemented with 0.4 mM MgSO4, 3 μM thiamine HCl, 0.2% d-glucose, 6 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When OD600nm reached ∼0.2, cells were induced by 1 mM IPTG for 10 min. Three OD600nm units of culture was then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (MF membrane, 0.45 μm; Millipore; Tullagreen, Carrigtwohill, Ireland) placed on a supporting surface that was connected to a vacuum suction system. After sucking away medium, cells on the filters were treated with 10 mM MTSES− or 1 mM MTSET+ in K0 medium (46 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 10 mM NaCl, pH 7) for 15 s. Filters were then washed by 3 ml K0 medium and placed in a 50-ml plastic beaker to dry at 50°C overnight. The solute on the filter was dissolved in 3 ml double-distilled water and assayed for K+ by flame photometry (Jenway; Dunmow, Essex, UK).Glutamate efflux assay E. coli PB104 cells were grown in K10 medium [46 mM Na2HPO4, 8 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 10 mM KCl, adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH] with supplements [0.4 mM MgSO4, 3 μM thiamine HCl, 0.2% d-glucose, 6 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin] until OD600nm reached ∼0.2, then the same amount of prewarmed K10 medium (pH 8.5) with supplements and 1 M NaCl was added to the culture. After 2 h, the cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 10 min before being transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Treatment with MTSES− or MTSET+ was performed the same way as for the K+ assay, except K10 medium plus 0.5M NaCl (pH 7) was used to dissolve the drugs and wash the filters. The filters were then stored at −80°C before measurement of glutamate using a glutamate assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA).Trehalose efflux assay E. coli PB104 cells were grown in K10 medium [46 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 10 mM KCl, pH 7] with supplements [0.4 mM MgSO4, 3 μM thiamine HCl, 0.2% d-glucose, 6 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin] until OD600 reached ∼0.2. The culture was then divided into 2 aliquots. The first portion of culture was induced by IPTG for 10 min and was transferred to nitrocellulose filters for drug treatment. The second portion was diluted with the same amount of prewarmed K10 medium (pH 7) with supplements and 1 M NaCl for 2 h before IPTG induction and drug treatment on the filter, which was conducted the same way as for the glutamate measurement. The filters were stored at −80°C before measurement of trehalose using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (19). The amount of trehalose was calculated by subtracting values of the first portion culture measurement from that of the corresponding second portion culture measurement, as described previously (20).Electrophysiology E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously (21, 22). Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature. Patch buffers used were 200 mM KCl buffer [200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 6], 600 mM KCl buffer (600 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 6), and low-KCl buffer (10 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 6). Spermine 4HCl and Na2-succinate were dissolved in low-KCl buffer, and pH was adjusted to 6 with KOH or HCl. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter, using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from Pclamp9 (Axon Instruments). Both MTSES− and MTSET+ application by pipette led to spontaneous opening of G26C MscL. MTSES− (4–10 mM) was applied by pipette to obtain full opening of single channels; sometimes low suction was applied. In most cases, MTSET+ applied by pipette led to the spontaneous opening of more than one channel, which brought difficulty for single-channel current measurement. We found that MTSET+ applied in the bath could gate the channel spontaneously after the channel was already opened by pipette suction. This finding is consistent with previous reports about the effect of MTSET+ on G26C MscL and G22C MscL, a mutation in a similar position of the channel (5, 11). Therefore, 2–4 mM MTSET+ was applied in bath solution (cytoplasmic side of MscL), and single spontaneous opening of the channel was achieved by opening a single channel by suction to allow access of MTSET+. G26C MscL could be opened within a broad range of pressure. In some patches, the pressure required was lower than that for wild-type MscL, while in other patches the pressure applied was much higher than that for wild-type MscL, which is consistent with previous reports (5, 15). This probably is due to different degrees of disulfide bridge formation in excised patches. Measurement of ionic preference was performed as follows: First, the offset was adjusted to 0 under 200 mM KCl buffer symmetric configuration when either MscS or MscL was opened and confirmed by channel reversal potential of 0 mV; Second, the bath solution was changed to 600 mM KCl buffer, and currents were recorded at the voltages shown to allow the current/voltage analysis. The influence of liquid junction potentials was eliminated by using an agarose bridge (2% agarose in 200 mM KCl buffer) as the reference electrode.RESULTS It has been assumed that, because of its large pore size, MscL has no ionic preference. Therefore, for this study, we initially sought to determine whether this was indeed the case. We recorded from inside-out patches obtained from giant bacterial spheroplasts, as described previously (21). Using asymmetric conditions, as described in Materials and Methods, the I/V plot of wild-type MscL was generated, and its reversal potential was determined. Figure 1 shows that wild-type MscL has a positive reversal potential of 0.57 ± 0.09 mV. This finding is much closer to the Cl− reversal potential (17.5 mV) than the reversal potential for K+ (−27.8 mV), thus indicating an anionic preference. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ionic preferences of wild-type and mutant MscL nanopores. A) Current-voltage plots of MscL under asymmetric ionic conditions (40 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 6.0, plus 200 mM KCl in pipette, 600 mM KCl in bath). Reversal potentials for Cl− and K+ are +17.5 and −27.8 mV, respectively. Graphs show current-voltage relationships of wild-type (WT) MscL and mutant MscL K31E, D39C, and G26C treated with either MTSES− or MTSET+ (n=6). B) Reversal potentials determined by current-voltage plots in A; n = 6. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. WT MscL; 2-tailed t test.Several lines of evidence suggest that the first transmembrane domain, TM1, forms the bulk of the lumen of the open-channel pore (4, 5, 7). One possible interpretation of the observed anionic preference of the MscL channel is that of a positive charge in the pore attracting anions and repulsing cations. Because K31 is the only positively charged residue in the TM1 domain of MscL, we studied the effects of mutating this site into a negatively charged residue. As expected, K31E mutant MscL has a reversal potential closer to that of K+ (−0.53±0.14 mV; Fig. 1A). Hence, although this mutation did not render a cationic preference, it did significantly decrease the anionic preference of the channel. We next addressed the question of whether we could influence ionic preference by manipulating other charges within the TM1 pore domain. There are two negatively charged residues in TM1, D18 and D39. Previously, in a cysteine scan of the region, we demonstrated that a D18C mutation led to a nonfunctional channel (15, 23); D39C, however, is functional (15). We therefore tested the ionic preference of D39C MscL. Consistent with the notion that D39 influences the ionic preference of the channel, we found that this mutant had an increased anionic preference (reversal potential 2.25±0.28 mV; Fig. 1). Several studies have demonstrated that charges can be engineered within the pore post-translationally by reacting charged sulfhydryl reagents with mutated channels containing unique cysteines, thus leading to a spontaneously gating channel (4, 5, 11). One such MscL mutant, G26C, is especially sensitive to the charged sulfhydryl reagents MTSET+ and MTSES− (5). We therefore utilized this approach to investigate potential changes of the ionic preference when the channel is gated by the introduction of a charge within the pore. As shown in Fig. 1, G26C MscL treated with MTSET+ had an increased anionic preference compared with that of the wild type MscL (reversal potential of 3.71±0.75 mV), indicating that the introduction of a positive charge into the pore of the MscL nanopore increases the permeation of anions. On the other hand, MTSES− treated G26C MscL had a decreased anionic preference (reversal potential of −1.69±0.09 mV). Clearly, charges within the pore of MscL not only encourage MscL channel gating (4, 5, 11, 12) but also modulate ionic preferences. Thus, we speculated that such charges would have even greater influences on the permeation of large charged molecules. To maintain turgor, E. coli cells accumulate osmolytes, such as K+, glutamate−, and trehalose, on osmotic upshock (20, 24, 25), and they release these and other osmolytes through MscL to survive osmotic downshock (2, 26–29). With this knowledge, we designed an in vivo assay to test the efflux of K+, glutamate−, and trehalose through G26C MscL modified and thus gated by charged thiol reagents. In the absence of membrane tension, the efflux was achieved when G26C MscL-expressing E. coli bacteria were treated with MTSET+ or MTSES−. As expected, the flux was mutant MscL specific; no efflux was observed from E. coli expressing wild-type MscL after MTSET+ or MTSES− treatment (data not shown). After MTSET+ or MTSES− treatment, <30% of the measurable K+ remained in cells (Fig. 2A). This value is only slightly higher than that observed from osmotic downshock, where it has been reported that 10–20% of intracellular K+ is resistant to osmotic-induced flux (30). Therefore, both MTSET+ and MTSES− treatments led to the efflux of the vast majority of the available K+. Interestingly, the efflux of glutamate−, a much larger molecule, showed dramatically more flux after MTSET+ treatment than after MTSES− treatment (Fig. 2A). While we suspected this difference in glutamate efflux was largely due to the charge introduction into channel pore, it could alternatively be because MTSET+ more efficiently gates the channel. We therefore determined the flux of glutamate− relative to that of trehalose, which is not charged, on MTSES− treatment. As seen in Fig. 2B, although trehalose is twice the size of glutamate−, it is more efficiently fluxed from the cell. Therefore, it appears that the negative charge within G26C MscL, which was introduced by MTSES−, decreased the efflux of the negatively charged glutamate− molecule through the channel. Figure 2.

These two large charged molecules have been reported previously to permeate through wild-type MscL (8). As shown in Fig. 3, when G26C MscL was treated with MTSES−, the conductance of succinate2− was decreased significantly when compared with wild-type MscL, again demonstrating that negative charges introduced into the MscL pore inhibit the permeation of larger negatively charged molecules. Interestingly, MTSES−-treated G26C MscL had a significantly increased conductance for spermine4+ (Fig. 4). In contrast, when the G26C MscL was treated with MTSET+, the conductance for succinate2− was significantly increased (Fig. 3), and the permeation of spermine4+, as assessed by conductance, was significantly decreased for the MTSET+-treated G26C MscL (Fig. 4). MTSET+-treated G26C MscL displayed a full opening at a membrane potential of 0 mV, which was recorded before the application of each voltage step. At large membrane potentials, it had a propensity for substates (labeled as s in traces of Figs. 3 and 4). Prolonged application of a high membrane potential could lead to sustained substate opening, or even closure of the channel. The all-points histograms of channel openings at different voltage steps are shown in Supplemental Data. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that we are measuring a stabilized substate, we did weight the conductance measurements taken at lower membrane potentials where we were more confident in measuring fully open channels. Furthermore, it seems likely that the conductance of the channel measured at low potentials would be representative of the channel permeability as a nanovalve in a liposome reconstitution system. Together, the above data demonstrate that charges within the pore clearly influence the permeation of larger charged molecules: like charges significantly inhibit flux; opposite charges can increase flux.

As shown in Fig. 3, MTSES− treatment of G26C MscL did not significantly change the conductance of Na+. For Cl−, we observed a very slight decrease or increase on MTSES− or MTSET+ treatment, respectively. These data are consistent with the above findings that permeation of charged molecules is affected by additions of charges within the MscL pore. The result also suggests that the number of charges carried by ions and size of ions matters: larger compounds with more charges are more affected than small ions with fewer charges. This might be due to higher extent of charge repulsion/attraction and lower diffusion coefficiency for compounds with multiple charges and large size compared with monocharged ions of small size. In inside-out patches of E. coli spheroplast membranes, the periplasmic side of the channel faces the pipette, while the cytoplasmic side of the channel faces the bath. In the above experiments, the large compounds were added in the bath; therefore, they permeated from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side. Since there is bilateral asymmetry of the MscL channel pore in the plane of the membrane, with the pore constriction site located at the cytoplasmic end of the TM1 domain, there may also be asymmetry for the permeation of large charged compounds. Therefore, we tested the flow of spermine4+ from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. In this case, spermine 4HCl must be applied by pipette. For unknown reasons, it was difficult to form seals with 100 mM spermine 4HCl in the pipette solution; however, stable seals could be formed when the concentration of spermine 4HCl was reduced to 50 mM. Consistent with the data presented above, and as shown in Fig. 5, when 50 mM spermine4+ was applied to the bath, its conductance through the MTSES−-treated G26C MscL was significantly higher than that through wild-type MscL. Surprisingly, the increase in conductance was not observed when spermine4+ was applied by the pipette. Similarly, when spermine4+ was applied to the bath, its conductance through the MTSET+-treated G26C MscL pore was decreased significantly compared with that through wild-type MscL; but when spermine4+ was in the pipette, its conductance was not significantly changed. Together, these data demonstrate not only that the permeation of large charged molecules is influenced by charges in channel pore, but that this influence depends on the orientation of the channel within the membrane. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Comparison of spermine 4HCl permeation from periplasmic vs. cytoplasmic side of the MscL channel. Permeation of spermine4+ and Cl− is expressed as conductance of MscL under negative and positive membrane potential, respectively. Values are means ± se; n = 6. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. corresponding wild-type (WT) MscL group; 2-tailed t test.DISCUSSION In sum, the data demonstrate that, although MscL has a large channel pore (30–40 Å; ref. 8), modifying the charge profile of its pore-forming TM1 domain could either increase or decrease the anionic preference of the channel. Moreover, gating the MscL channel by the insertion of charges can drastically influence the permeation of larger charged compounds, and that this influence depends on the orientation of the channel. These findings have important implications when designing a drug-release device from an engineered MscL nanopore, as previously proposed (13, 14, 31, 32). To avoid inhibiting the permeation of specific charged drugs or other compounds, one might want to consider the charge used to gate the pore. However, in many instances this might be impractical. For example, low pH is one of the main intrinsic properties that can be found in cancer tissues and inflammation sites in the body, and hence is a common target for triggered drug-delivery devices. However, for such a purpose, a pH-sensitive MscL nanovalve could only be gated by a positive-charge introduction into the channel pore, which could inhibit the release of positively charged drug compounds. Alternatively, it would be advantageous to control the orientation of the nanopore in the vesicular release device. Normally, the insertion of MscL into liposomal membranes is random (33). However, the direction of a synthetic peptide reconstituted into liposomes has been controlled by inserting a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain at its end (34). The C terminus of MscL appears to be tolerant to truncation and insertion of tags (16, 17, 35) and thus might be an appropriate location for the addition of such a PEG label, allowing for a cytoplasmic-side-out orientation in a liposome reconstitution system. In this orientation, a charge introduction in the pore would have less influence on the efflux of charged molecules. For both the light sensor and pH sensors previously described (13, 14), the orientation of the sensor might not matter, given that light, and even protons with time, can penetrate the membrane. In addition, it has been reported that a histidine substituted at G22 is accessible to cytoplasmic protons (12). Furthermore, the addition of a PEG group is not likely to be deleterious to the vesicular device; PEG lipids are used routinely in what are termed “stealth vesicles,” because they allow for the evasion of opsonization and uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, and thus have an extended half-life within an organism (36, 37). Overall, nanocarriers are emerging platforms for cancer therapy, and yet the challenge remains in selectively binding and targeting cancer cells (38). Because it has the potential to release therapeutic compounds within or near target tissues on specific stimuli, a controllable MscL nanovalve with high efflux efficiency would be a step toward a selective and efficient nanocarrier.Supplementary Material Supplemental Data supp_25_1_428__index.html (923B, html) Acknowledgments The authors thank Drs.

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

    "introduction": "Introduction The E. coli mscL was the first gene definitively shown to encode a mechanosensitive channel activity.1 The encoded mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) protein (EcoMscL) is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels, serving as a paradigm for how a protein can sense membrane tension.2 A crystal structure from M. tuberculosis MscL (MtMscL) was first obtained by Douglas Rees' group in 1998, depicting what appeared to be a closed state of the channel.3,4 It was a homopentamer with each subunit containing two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal α-helical bundle. The same group recently obtained a second crystal structure from a C-terminal truncated S. aureus MscL (SaMscL) in what they speculated to be an expanded intermediate state; surprisingly, this was a tetramer.5 A different oligomeric state was unexpected given that the two orthologs are highly conserved [Fig. 1(A)], as is the entire MscL family.6–8 To further investigate the discrepancy between the stoichiometry of these two channels, several studies have been performed. In one study, we developed an in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to determine the state of the S. aureus channel when in its native membrane environment; it was unambiguously a pentamer, demonstrating that the crystal did not reflect a native state of the protein.9 Thus, two possibilities existed: either the truncation of the C-terminal bundle altered channel stoichiometry to tetramer, or the detergent solubilization did. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugations and light scattering, we concluded that on solubilization with the detergent n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as a tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergents did not alter stoichiometry.9 However, the influence of protein truncation was not assessed. Indeed, one previous study of in vitro translated and n-Octyl-Beta-D-Glucopyranoside (OG) solubilized EcoMscL implied that the C-terminal end of the protein played a critical role in assembly.10 Recently, using a new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees' group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that a SaMscL with the C-terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heterogeneous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pentamers and tetramers. Thus, it appeared that the C-terminal helical bundle does influence the oligomeric state of the protein. However, because both of these studies used detergent-solubilized proteins, it was unclear if the C-terminal region of the protein played a role in MscL stoichiometry in vivo. Here, we utilize our in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to address this issue. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Alignment of MscL homologs and protein modifications. A: Sequence alignment of three MscL homologs from E. coli (EcoMscL), M. tuberculosis (MtMscL), and S. aureus (SaMscL) showing the regions corresponding to the different protein domains. The degree of conservation is color coded with dark blue residues indicating identity and light blue similarity. The red arrows at the C-terminal end of SaMscL sequence indicate the sites were the stop codons were added to generate the different C-terminal truncated constructs. B: Localization of residues A10 (red) and L97 (blue) in M. tuberculosis MscL, corresponding to L10 and M91 in SaMscL. These residues were substituted to cysteines for the in vivo disulfide trapping experiments. A lateral view (left) and bottom view (right) are shown. C: Crystal structure of M. tuberculosis MscL, showing a pentameric stoichiometry. The inset shows a detail of the C-terminal domain and the location of the C-terminal truncations. To evaluate the role of the c-terminal region of SaMscL in its oligomeric state, we have generated multiple C-terminal truncated constructs of different lengths that have two cysteine mutations (L10C/M91C; Fig. 1). As can be seen in Figure 1(B), these two sites are predicted to be in close proximity in the closed state3 and have been shown previously to generate the most efficient in vivo crosslinking.9 We investigated the FL channel as well as four different C-terminal deletions: Δ95 (which was the truncation crystallized as a tetramer), Δ99, Δ103, and Δ107. Two of these truncations, Δ95 and Δ99, are located in the linker between TM2 and the cytoplasmic helix and the other two are in the cytoplasmic helix itself [Fig. 1(A,C)]. As previously described, bacteria expressing the different constructs were given an osmotic shock in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this removes cellular reducing agents such as glutathione while adding an oxidant. The treated cells were pelleted, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading buffer, and the MscL protein visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot. Note that the protein is trapped in its native membrane environment because no solubilization or protein handling is involved before SDS PAGE. As shown in Figure 2 (left and center panels), SaMscL exists almost exclusively as a pentamer regardless of the length of the C-terminal truncation. Although a ladder of monomer through pentamer can be observed for 10C/91C Δ95 SaMscL in the no-shock/nontreated protein, in the presence of an oxidizer the pentamer becomes the prevalent band in a time dependant manner (Fig. 2, right panel). Note that for the SaMscL single cysteine mutants under the same treatment, no other species than monomer was observed for M91C but a small proportion of L10C existed as dimmers (Supplemental information). Dimerization of L10C was expected as the equivalent mutant from EcoMscL, M12C, also form dimmers under similar treatment.11 Finally, we show by patch clamp of native membranes that both FL and Δ95 truncated 10C/91C SaMscL respond similarly to changes in the redox potential of the bath (Fig. 3). In the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), both channels are functional and activity can be observed in response to negative pressures applied to the membrane patch (left traces). After perfusion with a 3% peroxide solution, channel activity could no longer be elicited even under high negative pressures (right traces). These results are consistent with the channels being locked closed after disulfide trapping, suggesting that in native membranes the FL and truncated channels are structural and functionally similar. Hence, in vivo the C-terminal helical bundle plays no detectable role in proper pentameric assembly. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Disulfide trapping experiments show that C-terminally truncated SaMscL protein exists as a pentamer in vivo. Western blot analysis of WT SaMscL, double cysteine mutant 10C/91C SaMscL FL and with Δ95 truncation (left panel). All samples were either nonshocked (NS) or shocked (S+) in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper phenanthroline. When shocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline the majority of 10C/91C exists as a pentamer, independent of the length of the C-terminal truncation (left and central panels). A ladder of monomer through pentamer is already present in the nonshock sample; pentamer becomes the major band when osmotically downshocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this occurs in a time-dependent manner (right panel). Note that no detergent solubilization before resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer is performed in these experiments. Figure 3. Open in a new tab The FL and truncated SaMscL 10C/91C channels are functionally similar. The electrophysiological data shows single-channel activities of both SaMscL 10C/91C FL and the truncated construct Δ95 SaMscL 10C/91C. Channel openings are seen as upward deflections. Both channels respond equally to changes in the redox potential of the bath. In the presence of the reducing agent DTT, the channels are functional and activity can be observed at the indicated pressures (left traces), but after perfusing a peroxide solution in the bath, the channel activity is lost (right traces). Many previous studies have concluded that MtMscL and EcoMscL are also pentamers. A study using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium, and size-exclusion chromatography showed EcoMscL as a pentamer;12 another study using crosslinking and electron microscopy reached the same conclusion.10 The crystal structure of MtMscL as well as the recent OCAM analysis also showed a pentameric structure for this ortholog.13 Finally, when studied by using our in vivo disulfide trapping in native membranes, all three MscL homologs have shown pentameric stoichiometry (Supplementary Information). Hence, there appears to be no variability in the oligomeric state of these MscL orthologs. Collectively, the data suggest that the C-terminal domain of the SaMscL channel only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the protein when it is solubilized in detergent. Different detergents seem to have different abilities to alter MscL oligomeric structure. It appears that LDAO is the harshest detergent in this sense, leading to oligomeric rearrangement of the full-length SaMscL protein.9 DDM and perhaps other detergents can lead to rearrangements of only the truncated, not FL, SaMscL.13 However, there also appear to be species differences; from the OCAM study, the FL EcoMscL appears to form hexamers as well as pentamers when solubilized in DDM. In addition, the same study demonstrated that truncation of the MtMscL did not destabilize the pentameric organization when solubilized in DDM.13 Hence, detergents alone can cause specific protein complexes to rearrange their oligomeric state while others appear stable. As detergent solubilization is a critical and necessary step to obtain membrane proteins for crystallization and other biophysical and structural studies, where possible, a complementary set of data assessing the oligomeric state in vivo seems advisable.",

Copyright © 2011 The Protein Society  Copyright notice ID: 3190158 PMID: 21739498 Abstract The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent. Keywords: mechanosensitive channel, oligomerization, detergent solubilization, stoichiometry, disulfide trappingIntroduction The E. coli mscL was the first gene definitively shown to encode a mechanosensitive channel activity.1 The encoded mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) protein (EcoMscL) is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels, serving as a paradigm for how a protein can sense membrane tension.2 A crystal structure from M. tuberculosis MscL (MtMscL) was first obtained by Douglas Rees' group in 1998, depicting what appeared to be a closed state of the channel.3,4 It was a homopentamer with each subunit containing two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal α-helical bundle. The same group recently obtained a second crystal structure from a C-terminal truncated S. aureus MscL (SaMscL) in what they speculated to be an expanded intermediate state; surprisingly, this was a tetramer.5 A different oligomeric state was unexpected given that the two orthologs are highly conserved [Fig. 1(A)], as is the entire MscL family.6–8 To further investigate the discrepancy between the stoichiometry of these two channels, several studies have been performed. In one study, we developed an in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to determine the state of the S. aureus channel when in its native membrane environment; it was unambiguously a pentamer, demonstrating that the crystal did not reflect a native state of the protein.9 Thus, two possibilities existed: either the truncation of the C-terminal bundle altered channel stoichiometry to tetramer, or the detergent solubilization did. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugations and light scattering, we concluded that on solubilization with the detergent n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as a tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergents did not alter stoichiometry.9 However, the influence of protein truncation was not assessed. Indeed, one previous study of in vitro translated and n-Octyl-Beta-D-Glucopyranoside (OG) solubilized EcoMscL implied that the C-terminal end of the protein played a critical role in assembly.10 Recently, using a new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees' group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that a SaMscL with the C-terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heterogeneous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pentamers and tetramers. Thus, it appeared that the C-terminal helical bundle does influence the oligomeric state of the protein. However, because both of these studies used detergent-solubilized proteins, it was unclear if the C-terminal region of the protein played a role in MscL stoichiometry in vivo. Here, we utilize our in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to address this issue. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Alignment of MscL homologs and protein modifications. A: Sequence alignment of three MscL homologs from E. coli (EcoMscL), M. tuberculosis (MtMscL), and S. aureus (SaMscL) showing the regions corresponding to the different protein domains. The degree of conservation is color coded with dark blue residues indicating identity and light blue similarity. The red arrows at the C-terminal end of SaMscL sequence indicate the sites were the stop codons were added to generate the different C-terminal truncated constructs. B: Localization of residues A10 (red) and L97 (blue) in M. tuberculosis MscL, corresponding to L10 and M91 in SaMscL. These residues were substituted to cysteines for the in vivo disulfide trapping experiments. A lateral view (left) and bottom view (right) are shown. C: Crystal structure of M. tuberculosis MscL, showing a pentameric stoichiometry. The inset shows a detail of the C-terminal domain and the location of the C-terminal truncations.To evaluate the role of the c-terminal region of SaMscL in its oligomeric state, we have generated multiple C-terminal truncated constructs of different lengths that have two cysteine mutations (L10C/M91C; Fig. 1). As can be seen in Figure 1(B), these two sites are predicted to be in close proximity in the closed state3 and have been shown previously to generate the most efficient in vivo crosslinking.9 We investigated the FL channel as well as four different C-terminal deletions: Δ95 (which was the truncation crystallized as a tetramer), Δ99, Δ103, and Δ107. Two of these truncations, Δ95 and Δ99, are located in the linker between TM2 and the cytoplasmic helix and the other two are in the cytoplasmic helix itself [Fig. 1(A,C)]. As previously described, bacteria expressing the different constructs were given an osmotic shock in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this removes cellular reducing agents such as glutathione while adding an oxidant. The treated cells were pelleted, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading buffer, and the MscL protein visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot. Note that the protein is trapped in its native membrane environment because no solubilization or protein handling is involved before SDS PAGE. As shown in Figure 2 (left and center panels), SaMscL exists almost exclusively as a pentamer regardless of the length of the C-terminal truncation. Although a ladder of monomer through pentamer can be observed for 10C/91C Δ95 SaMscL in the no-shock/nontreated protein, in the presence of an oxidizer the pentamer becomes the prevalent band in a time dependant manner (Fig. 2, right panel). Note that for the SaMscL single cysteine mutants under the same treatment, no other species than monomer was observed for M91C but a small proportion of L10C existed as dimmers (Supplemental information). Dimerization of L10C was expected as the equivalent mutant from EcoMscL, M12C, also form dimmers under similar treatment.11 Finally, we show by patch clamp of native membranes that both FL and Δ95 truncated 10C/91C SaMscL respond similarly to changes in the redox potential of the bath (Fig. 3). In the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), both channels are functional and activity can be observed in response to negative pressures applied to the membrane patch (left traces). After perfusion with a 3% peroxide solution, channel activity could no longer be elicited even under high negative pressures (right traces). These results are consistent with the channels being locked closed after disulfide trapping, suggesting that in native membranes the FL and truncated channels are structural and functionally similar. Hence, in vivo the C-terminal helical bundle plays no detectable role in proper pentameric assembly. Figure 2.

X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices. Keywords: Osmoregulation, Conductance, Nanopore, Biosensor, Drug-release device The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes.1 This channel was first identified in E. coli, and most functional studies have been undertaken in this species. A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has 67% similarity, has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane α helices (TM1 and TM2), of which TM1 forms the pore of the channel and TM2 is exposed to the lipid bilayer.2 Although a more recent crystal structure of MscL from S. aureus shows a tetrameric complex,3 this appears to be a detergent-specific oligomeric organization not reflecting a physiological state; in vivo essentially all channels are pentameric.4–5 The pentameric channel opens by the expansion of both TM1 and TM2 in response to tension in cell membrane.6–11 The channel also contains a single carboxyl terminal α helix from each subunit that together assemble into a 5-helix cytoplasmic bundle (CB).2 It remains unclear what the function of the CB is, and whether or to what extent the bundle is dissociated during channel gating. Previous studies have shown that the E. coli MscL channel has a very large pore size, greater than 30Å,12 which has caused some researchers to speculate that it could be used in nanodevices. Indeed, it has many properties that would make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve in such devices. It can be translated in vitro13 or synthetically synthesized, reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex.14 Since introduction of charges into the channel pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension,7, 15–18 E. coli MscL has been engineered into controllable nanovalves that detect alternative modalities including light19 and pH.20 The channel has been shown to be functional in vesicular-release devices,19–21 as well as in an engineered microelectronic array chip;22 its large pore size yields a robust response in such devices. However, for some purposes a smaller or adjustable pore size would be of advantage. The data presented within this study on E. coli MscL have two aspects: first, they resolve the issue of whether the CB disassociates upon normal channel opening, and second, they demonstrate that the MscL nanopore response can be effectively and reversibly modulated, which would have advantages in an assortment of potential nanodevices. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Disassociation of the c-terminal α helical bundle is not required for normal gating and conductance of the MscL channel As shown in Figure 1a, the X-ray crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis MscL channel shows a pentameric structure in which the five subunits, at the c-terminal, form an α helical cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB). The conformation, functional role and stability of the CB of the MscL channel have remained controversial. We reasoned that if the CB was indeed a helical bundle and was stable even upon gating, the sieve-like structure suggested avenues for controlling channel pore size and conductance by constraints and deletions within this area. Figure 1. Open in a new tab In vivo cross linking of cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB) of MscL L121-122C/L128-129C mutant. a. The side view of X-ray crystal structure of MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB code 2OAR). A single subunit of MscL channel is shown on the left and is also highlighted as dark gray in a homopentameric channel (right). Each subunit contains two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and one cytoplasmic α-helix, which assemble into a five-fold cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB). In the middle of the cytoplasmic linker, the equivalent amino acids of E. coli (A110-115) that were either mutated or deleted for this study are shown, as well as the location of the mutated leucines within the bundle. Note that the E. coli 128 and 129L are not observed in the M. tuberculosis structure. b. Western blot showing that disulfide bridges of a MscL tetra cysteine mutant (L121-122C/L128-129C) lead to cross linking of channel subunits. Before loading with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer, cells expressing MscL L121-122C/L128-129C mutant were grown in high osmolarity (lane 1), some of which were then osmoticaly downshocked (lane 2), or osmoticaly downshocked in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline (lane 3), with the latest having a ladder of monomer through pentamer (1X–5X) formed by disulfide bridging between different subunits of the complex.The CB was originally revealed in the crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis MscL,2 but it adopted what appeared to be a non-stable confirmation with negatively charged residues facing each other. Subsequently, Anishkin et al. proposed a more stable conformation for the CB based on the crystal structure of the pentameric cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which has a consensus motif, ALQDVRELLR, similar to that of the MscL CB, LLxEIRDLLK.23 The COMP crystal structure showed a strongly amphipathic helix in which all apolar residues are packed inside the fivefold bundle. In an attempt to address the correctness and the stability of this proposed structure for the CB, Anishkin et al. mutated the pairs of leucines predicted to face each other to cysteines within the consensus motif; these formed cross bridges between subunits, as anticipated from the authors’ proposed structure, yet normal channel activity was observed.23 The authors interpreted these data as suggesting not only that their proposed structure was correct, but that the CB remained intact upon gating. Subsequently, a re-evaluation of the MscL crystal structure24 confirmed the more stable conformation of the CB. However, a site-directed spin labeling study on E. coli MscL revealed a significant difference in the structure of the end of TM2, which was explained by several possibilities, including that the c-terminus of each channel subunit might not assemble into CB but, instead, fold toward the membrane interface establishing specific tertiary contacts with TM2.25 In addition, a more recent study using atomic force microscopy noted that the bundle appeared to be missing in a spontaneously opened MscL mutant, suggesting that the CB was not as stable as predicted and did indeed disassociate upon gating.26 In critically evaluating the Anishkin et al. study, we noted that the patch clamp traces were obtained at threshold- rather than saturating-stimulus conditions. But patch clamp is exquisitely sensitive, detecting single molecular events, while the cysteine crosslinking at these sites is extremely inefficient. It therefore seemed possible that the activities observed in the Anishkin study could simply be the channels that contained little or no crosslinking. We therefore performed experiments where saturating stimulus was applied to a L121-122C/L128-129C mutant to determine whether the opening of this CB is required for normal E. coli MscL channel gating and conductance, we mutated all four leucine residues in the amphipathic motif, which are predicted to face each other,23–24 to cysteines (L121-122C and L128-129C). This allowed for stabilization of the CB by the formation of disulfide bridges. As seen in Figure 1b, and consistent with a previous study,23 the extent of cross linking in individual MscL complexes varies, giving a ladder of MscL monomers to pentamers in a non-reduced SDS PAGE gel as visualized by Western. Given that patch clamp records single molecular events, it is possible to observe a minority of channels, presumably only those that contain no disulfide bridges and thus have normal sensitivity and gating properties. To control for this possibility, we measured the total current from all channels within the patch by using a saturating stimulus. In this experiment, the total MscL current under ambient conditions was 5,176 pA. After addition of oxidizing agent Cu-phenanthroline of 1 mM in bath solution for 20 min, the total MscL channel current in the same path was 5,240 pA, demonstrating that few or none of the channels were locked closed or in a substate. Upon application of 10 mM DTT for 20 min to bath solution, the total MscL channel current was measured to be 5,080 pA, demonstrating that no channels were revealed under reduced conditions. Cu-phenanthroline and DTT treatment also did not appear to change the mechanosensitivity of MscL L121–122C, L128–129C; the ratio of pMscL/pMscS threshold, as described previously 27 and in the Materials and Methods, was 1.5 ± 0.1 before and after cu-phenanthroline treatment (p > 0.05, paired t test, n = 7). These results definitively show that disassociation of the CB is not required for normal gating and conductance of the MscL channel.Deletions within the TM2/CB linker lead to channels with decreased conductance Although it is clear that disassociation of the CB is not required for normal gating, it is still useful to know whether the CB, when not constrained, normally dissociates during channel gating. If the CB does not disassociate, then deletions within the TM2/CB linker of E. coli MscL, which is similar to length as that shown for the M. tuberculosis structure in Figure 1, should lead to constraints of the TM2 movement or decreases in the size of the ‘sieve’, thus modifying the membrane tension mechanosensitivity threshold or lowering conductance. To test this hypothesis, we kept the CB intact and deleted different ranges of amino acids from the TM2/CB linker of E. coli MscL. All point histogram analyses revealed that single channel currents from MscL Δ110-112 were 73.1 ± 1.2 pA, a range significantly lower than that of wild type (WT) MscL channel (84.7 ± 1.7 pA) (Table 1). The MscL Δ110-115 channel, which had a more significant deletion, had a further attenuated single channel current with most of the single channel openings below 30 pA (Table 1). The pMscL/pMscS of MscL Δ110-112 and MscL Δ110-115 were 1.5 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1, respectively, with the latter significantly increased relative to that for wild type MscL (1.5 ± 0.0) (Table 1). Hence, the Δ110-115 mutant was significantly less sensitive to membrane tension. Representative current traces and all point histograms of wild type MscL, MscL Δ110-112 and Δ110-115 are shown in Figures 2 and 3. These data contrast studies in which half of the TM2/CB linker as well as the entire CB were deleted. For example, the MscL Δ110-136 deletion mutant has no apparent change in either mechanosensitivity or conductance.23,27–28 More recently, it has been shown that a similar Δ95–119 S. aureus truncated channel assembles into a normal pentameric complex in vivo4–5 and effects relatively normal channel activity.3, 5 Together, these data demonstrate that although the CB is not required for normal assembly or gating, if it is present, the CB is quite stable and does not dissociate during the normal gating process; these data also reveal a novel way to systematically control MscL channel pore size and conductance.

Figure 2. Open in a new tab Deletions in TM2/CB linker of MscL decrease its current. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg. As shown, compared with single channel current of wild type MscL (WT), MscL with 110–112 deletion (Δ110-112) has slightly decreased current and the current of the MscL with the 110–115 deletion (Δ110-115) is further reduced and has a short open time, or ‘flickery’ behavior.Figure 3. Open in a new tab All point histogram of the TM2/CB linker deletions. As shown, the single channel current of wild type MscL (WT) is 87pA, while that of MscL Δ110-112 is decreased to 73pA. Due to the short open times observed for MscL Δ110-115, the peak opening currents could not easily be measured, but most of the channel openings are below 30 pAEngineering a triggered nanovalve with a smaller pore size The MscL G22C mutant has been reported to be able to be used as a triggered nanovalve in liposomes that could modulate the release of a liposome payload.19–20 Briefly, a charge in the pore can gate the channel; thus, the G22C MscL mutant can be gated by the positively charged thiol reactive agent MTSET+. We therefore combined the mutations of G22C and Δ110-115 in order to engineer a triggered MscL nanovalve with throttled currents. As shown in Figure 4a, the resulting G22C/Δ110-112 mutant had spontaneous openings after MTSET+ treatment that were similar to the MscL G22C alone. All point histogram analyses showed that, when gated by MTSET+, single channels of G22C with the Δ110-115 deletion indeed opened primarily to allow lower currents of 9.5 ± 1.8 pA, while G22C opened mostly to allow larger currents of 19.5 ± 1.9 pA (Table 1). Moreover openings of G22C MscL at 56.5 ± 1.5 pA could also be seen, but were not prominent in the deletion mutant. These two mutants were observed to open at 74.0 ± 1.0 pA and 76.0 ± 1.0 pA only in very rare instances. The representative traces of the spontaneous opening of MscL G22C and G22C/Δ110-115 are shown in Figure 4a. These data are consistent with a stable CB: the shorter the cytoplasmic linker, the higher the restriction imposed on the TM2 movement or the smaller in sieve size, and thus the smaller and less stable the open pore size. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Engineering and testing of a MscL nanovalve with a decreased pore size. a. Patch clamp recordings show the spontaneous single channel opening of G22C (left) and G22C/Δ110-115 (right) after MTSET+ treatment. “O1” and “C” refer to main opening and closing of the channel, respectively, and “O2” refers to a higher level opening of the channel; note that no pressure was needed to gate either channel. b. Percentage calcein release from vesicles reconstituted with G22C (black line), G22C/Δ110-115 (red line) or without MscL protein (gray line). The dashed lines show the standard derivation of fluorescence signal from three independent experiments. The arrows indicate addition of MTSET+, followed by Triton X-100 detergent to measure the 100% calcein content.The small conductance of G22C with Δ110-115 suggests a small channel pore size and likely a decreased ability to translocate larger compounds. We therefore performed a calcein efflux assay on liposomes reconstituted with the G22C/Δ110-115 mutant MscL proteins, as previously described.19–21 Liposomes loaded with 50 mM calcein have a low fluorescence signal due to self-quenching of the dye at this concentration. When calcein is released from liposomes into the bulk solution, however, its apparent fluorescence increases. As shown in Figure 4b, G22C/Δ110-115 MscL had a much reduced calcein efflux compared with G22C MscL consistent with pore size reduction; no calcein efflux was observed from liposomes not reconstituted with the MscL protein.Disulfide crosslinking of the TM2/CB linker decreases channel conductance The TM2/CB linker is potentially a highly dynamic region; thus constraining this region should lead to a channel with decreased conductance; we therefore mutated the three alanines at positions 110–112, which are approximately in the middle of the TM2/CB linker, to cysteines. The formation of disulfide cross links between MscL A110-112C channel subunits was confirmed by Western blot (Figure 5), where dimers, trimers, tetramers and pentamers were measured. For these experiments E. coli had a reducing environment in the cytoplasm, which was maintained by glutathione and thioredoxin systems.29 Thus, as previously described,30 when bacteria release these endogenous reducing agents upon osmotic shock, more cross linking between different subunits was observed. As expected, osmotic downshock itself increased crosslinking, and together with Cu-phenanthroline treatment it showed the most pronounced crosslinking (Figure 5a). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Cysteine cross linking decreases MscL A110-112 current. a. Western blot showing that disulfide bridges of a MscL triple cysteine mutant (A110-112C) lead to cross linking of channel subunits. Before loading with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer, cells expressing MscL A110-112C mutant were grown in high osmolarity (lane 1), some of which were then osmoticaly downshocked (lane 2), or treated with oxidizing agent Cu-phenanthroline (lane 3), or osmoticaly downshocked in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline (lane 4). A ladder of monomer through pentamer (1X–5X) is formed by cross linking between different subunits. As shown, shock plus Cu-phenanthroline treatment leads to the most pronounced formation of cross-linking among channel subunits. b. Change in the current of MscL A110-112C mutant before and after DTT treatment. Data were pooled from 15 patch clamp recordings. *** p < 0.001 by two tailed and paired t test. c. One representative patch clamp recording of single channel opening of MscL A110-112C before (left) and after (Right) DTT treatment, which serves as a reducing agent to break the disulfide bridges formed between two cysteines. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg.Patch clamp recordings under ambient conditions showed that MscL A110-112C opens under normal levels of stimuli, but does not open to a full and normal unitary conductance. However, after DTT was added to the bath solution to cleave the disulfide bridges, the conductance of the channel significantly increased (Figure 5b). The variance observed for the conductance of MscL A110-112C is presumably due to the different amounts of cross linking within individual channels. Representative traces of MscL A110-112C before and after DTT treatment is shown in Figure 5c. DTT treatment did not alter the mechanosensitivity of MscL A110-112C channel (pMscL/pMscS threshold was 1.7 ± 0.1 before DTT treatment and 1.9 ± 0.2 after DTT treatment, Table 1). There is also no significant difference between the mechanosensitivity of MscL A110-112C and wild type channel (Table 1). Together, these data demonstrate that the conductance of the MscL channel can be specifically decreased by the generation of disulfide bridges within the TM2/CB linker then restored on disulfide cleavage.Bundling the TM2/CB linker by engineering a heavy metal binding site within it allows for the reversible decrease in channel conductance We have previously demonstrated that MscL channel activity can be modulated by heavy metals subsequent to engineering a heavy metal binding site within the pore.31 Therefore, it seemed possible that a similar approach may allow a reversible alteration in MscL conductance. Toward this end, we generated two MscL histidine mutants: A110H and A112H. The presence of Zn2+ could theoretically coordinate the histidine residues within the complex, and therefore lead to what was effectively cross linking at the specific sites mutated. All point histogram analyses showed that the single channel current of MscL A110H and A112H were 74.9 ± 1.7 pA and 80.2 ± 3.6 pA, respectively. ZnCl2 treatment in the bath solution indeed dramatically decreased the single channel current of MscL 110H and 112H to 35.7 ± 2.1 pA and 43.1 ± 3.9 pA (Table 1), respectively. Interestingly, the open dwell time of the main opening of MscL after ZnCl2 treatment is significantly increased, suggesting the unexpected stabilization of a substate. The effect of ZnCl2 on the conductance of both mutants was reversible after ZnCl2 was washed out. The representative current traces and all point histograms of MscL A110H and A112H are shown in Figure 6. The pressure required to open MscL A110H was unchanged (138.3 ± 13.8 mmHg before ZnCl2 treatment and 133.5 ± 13.1 mmHg after the treatment, Table 1); The pressure for MscL A112H showed only a modest decrease in sensitivity (136.3 ± 14.0 mmHg before ZnCl2 treatment and 150.2 ± 16.9 mmHg after treatment, Table 1). ZnCl2 had no effect in the conductance and pressure threshold of the wild type MscL channel, which is consistent with a previous study.31 Thus, cross linking at A110H or A112H by heavy metal coordination could effectively and reversibly decrease the conductance of MscL channel.

Patch clamp recordings of MscL mutants A110H and A112H. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively, and “S” refers to low level opening or substance of the channel. As shown, the current is decreased by ZnCl2 treatment in the bath solution, and is reversed to the control level by washing out the ZnCl2. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg. B. The all point histogram analyses, reflecting the decrease in conductance of MscL A110H and A112H by ZnCl2 treatment.Implications for nanotech-devices There is growing interest in the use of biosensors in nanotechnology. For such purposes, these results add to the argument that the MscL nanovalve is extremely pliable. Previous studies have shown the modality of the MscL sensor can be changed to light or pH.19–20 In addition, the permeation of specific charged molecules can be adjusted.32 Here we demonstrate that conductance, and likely the pore size can also be modified via three different methods. Modifying MscL modality and permeation, adjusting the pore size has implications in the versatility of the MscL nanovalve in nanodevices. For example, one group has proposed using MscL as a triggered nanovalve in drug-release devices.20 The wild type MscL channel has a huge pore size of greater than 30 Å, which allows facile translocation of both large and small compounds. Modifying the length of the cytoplasmic linker would allow one to now engineer a MscL nanovalve with throttled pore that will only pass smaller molecules. Thus, if two engineered MscL nanovalves responsive to different stimuli are used within a single vesicular-based nanodevice, stimulus-dependent differential release of drugs or other payloads through the nanovalve could be contemplated. Other groups propose using ion channels as molecular switches in tethered lipid bilayers on a chip surface;33–34 indeed, MscL has been reconstituted and shown to function in such a microchip device.22 In this system, the ability to reversibly decrease the channel conductance may be of advantage. One could imagine modulating the conductance of MscL A110-112C by changes in redox conditions. Such modulation could be useful in “resetting” the gain of a microchip device that has reached saturation. However, the variability in the type and extent of cross linking at C110-112 may limit this approach. On the other hand, Zn coordination of 110H or 112H leads to controlled, reversible, and characteristic changes in channel behavior with the primary conductance being reduced by half. In summary, this contribution illustrates three additional routes to extend the flexibility in engineering a MscL nanovalve with a set of desired properties, including a variable pore size. The range of MscL modification makes these channels more versatile for use in an assortment of nanodevices.CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that the CB is quite stable, even upon channel opening. This finding suggested that the MscL nanovalve can be engineered to have a smaller pore size and conductance by decreasing the TM2/CB linker, which appears to serve as a molecular sieve. The linker can easily be modified in at least three ways: shortening by deletions, or constraining the region by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination; in later two cases the decreases in pore size are even reversible. These results provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.METHODS Strains and cell growth The E. coli MscL mutants were generated using the Mega Primer method as described previously.35 Mutants were inserted within the pB10b or pB10d expression construct, a modified pB10b plasmid.27,36–37 E. coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm)36 was used for in vivo assays and electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NY, USA) plus ampicillin (100μg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cycles/min. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace Inc, Maumee, OH, USA). IN VIVO disulfide trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl in LB media) or shocked in water (with or without 15 μM Cu-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 20 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re-suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a 4%–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis. 30,38 The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used at 1:2,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 1:40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and exposed to film.Electrophysiology E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.38–39 Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under a membrane potential of −20 mV. Patch buffers used are 200 mM KCl buffer composed of 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The pH of patch buffer was 6.0, except for MscL A110H and A112H, which need to be treated with ZnCl2 at pH 8.0 for histidine coordination. 0.5 μM to 2 mM ZnCl2 was applied to bath solution for 5 to 20 min for this purpose. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20kHz with a 5 kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to the patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Where possible, the pressure thresholds required for MscL gating within single patches were compared before and after treatment (e.g. addition and washout of Zn2+). To compare MscL pressure threshold sensitivities between patches of native membranes, MscS was used as an internal standard as described previously27,36; the changes in mechanosensitivity of MscL were measured by comparison of the pMscL/pMscS pressure threshold ratios. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from Pclamp9 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). Agarose (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA) bridge (2% agarose in 200 mM KCl buffer) was used as the reference electrode. To cleave disulfide bridges formed in the cysteine mutant MscL channels, 2–10 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) was applied in to the bath solution for 3 to 20 min. As previously described,7,15,32 2–4 mM MTSET+ (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc, North York, Canada) was applied in bath solution (Cytoplasmic side of MscL) and single spontaneous opening of MscL channel with G22C or G22C plus Δ110-5 was achieved by opening a single channel via suction to allow access of MTSET+.Calcein efflux assay The calcein efflux assay was performed as previously described.19 Pet21a plasmid was used for the construction and hosted in strain PB116, which is a λDE3 lysogenization (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA) of PB106 27. The MscL proteins were tagged with a multihistidine tag at their c-terminal ends. The histidine-tagged MscL proteins were purified12 and reconstituted into lipid vesicles composed of in molar 70 % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 10 % Cholesterol and 5 % 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL, USA). After protein reconstitution was performed at 60 °C for 30 min in the presence of Anapoe-X-100 (Anatrace Inc.), calcein was added and allowed to equilibrate with the liposomes at room temperature for 20 min. The detergent was removed by biobeads incubation overnight at 4°C. Free calcein was then removed by passage through a G-50 fine Sephadex column (GE Healthcare Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) washed with vesicle buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM sucrose, pH 8.0). Vesicles were placed into clear 96-well plates and their fluorescence was recorded at 538 nm with the excitation at 485 nm using a Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The baseline of samples was recorded for 5 min followed by 30 min recording in the presence of 1 mM MTSET+. Vesicles were finally lysed by the addition of 0.5 % Triton X-100 to determine the total fluorescence levels of calcein encapsulated in vesicles.Acknowledgments The authors thank Drs.

    "abstract": "Abstract The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

    "introduction": "Introduction The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) of E. coli is to date one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how channels sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.1 The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation2; upon a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane tension3 acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4 in response to membrane tensions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5 A crystal structure of MscL from the homolog M. tuberculosis has been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7 (Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now suggests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9 The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for the S. aureus ortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10 further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is a detergent-specific process11,12; hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here. Open in a new tab Figure 1. Schematic representation of MscL from the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis. (A) The scheme on the left represents a pentameric MscL in a closed state with the S1 and TM2ci domains, in which the cysteine substitutions were performed, highlighted for clarity. The approximate location of the membrane is shown with horizontal gray lines. A single subunit is shown on the right to indicate all different MscL domains. (B)The same model with CPK representation of its residues shows how close the S1 and TM2ci domains are predicted to be in the closed structure of MscL. In the bottom view it can be appreciated that the S1 and TM2ci domains of alternating subunits, not direct neighbors, interact with each other. Upon gating, the best evidence suggests that the two transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane; as they do so, the first transmembrane TM1 twists in a cork-screw-like manner in a clockwise direction (when observed from the periplasm), and the channel then opens like the iris of an old-fashion camera. Note that in the crystal structure a vestibule of the closed pore is observed within the periplasmic side of the membrane, with the pore constriction occurring in the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane domains. Several studies have shown that this cytoplasmic-constriction region is important for channel gating. The N-terminal helix (S1) lies along the membrane and has been shown necessary for channel gating13,14; It appears to anchor TM1 to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to guide its tilting within the membrane during the gating process.15,16 The region of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface, (TM2ci; Fig. 1), has also been shown to influence the gating process. One of the residues within this subdomain, N103, has been shown to be incorporated into the membrane upon gating, presumably to accommodate for the longer tilted TM domains in the open state. Several additional residues in the TM2ci region are also crucial for this transition, thus tuning the gating of the channel. Although the structural data from the MscL crystal structure shows that the S1 and TM2ci domains are in very close proximity (Fig. 1B), little is known about protein-protein interactions in this region and their possible influence in the gating process. In this study we use an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to screen 143 double cysteine mutants to generate a detailed map of protein-protein interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains. Furthermore, to understand the dynamics of these interactions during the closed to open transition in E. coli MscL, we analyze the effects in single channel activity of different redox conditions by patch clamp. Two sets of mutants have shown changes in their activities under different redox conditions and suggest a model consistent with a concerted motion of the S1 domain and TM2ci.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Strains and cell growth E. coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL::Cm)30 was used as host for the pB10 expression constructs.14,30-32 PB104 was used for the in vivo cysteine trapping experiments and for the generation of spheroplasts for electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) media (Fisher Scientific) plus ampicillin (100 mg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cpm. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace). Generations of mutants Single mutants were generated using the mega primer technique as described.9 The double mutants were generated by digesting with restriction enzymes NsiI and BamHI, which separate the DNA encoding TM1 from that encoding TM2. The two fragments encoding the cysteine mutations were then ligated to generate the insert encoding the double cysteine mutants. In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB + ampicillin (approximately 410mOsmolar). LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a Criterion 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for western blot analysis.17 Note that in less than 5 min the samples are collected and loaded on the gel. Gels were run at 200 V for 55 min. and transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P (Millipore) in Tris-Glycine, 15% methanol and 0.01% SDS for 70 min. at 110V. After blocking, the primary antibody, anti- MscL was diluted to 1:15,000 and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, the secondary antibody, goat anti rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), was diluted to 1:100,000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed and developed with Millipore HRP substrate for 5 min and exposed to film. Disulfide trapping quantification The density of the bands was measured with Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The bands in each lane were measured as two sets, monomer and dimer, and trimers to pentamers (multimers). The values are expressed as the percentage of total protein existing as multimers. Electrophysiology E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.33 Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions using a buffer containing 200mM KCl, 90mM MgCl2, 10mM CaCl2, and 5mM HEPES pH 6 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To study redox effects in channel activity H2O2 1–3% v/v or dithiothreitol (DTT) 1–10 mM (Sigma) were added to the bath. A previous study has demonstrated that this treatment has no detrimental effect on channel function.34 Recordings were performed at -20 mV (positive pipette). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to monitor the pressure throughout the experiments. Data were analyzed using Clampfit9 from pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments).",
    "results": "Results In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2ci (F93-K105) residues in E. coli MscL channel (Fig. 1) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay.17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. To compare the likelihood of interactions between cysteine substituted residues from S1 and TM2ci domains, we measured the amount of protein existing as monomer through pentamers in western blots. We expressed the values as the percentage of multimers vs. the total protein. For the multimer value we counted only the trimers to pentamers because some single cysteine mutants in S1 can form dimers,15 thus leading to ambiguity. The 3D graph in Figure 2 summarizes our results. The X and Y axis are the residues from S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. Note that the graph shows a pattern where almost no multimer formation occurs between S1 and residues A95, M94 and F93, residues that are inside the membrane of TM2, while the strongest interactions occur between K105 to L102 and S1. Open in a new tab Figure 2. Interactions between cytoplasmic domains. The graph summarizes the results of the in vivo disulfide trapping experiments and compares the efficiency of multimer formation between 143 MscL double cysteine mutants. The y and x axis reflect the sequence of amino acids of the S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. The legend shows the color corresponding to each percentage value. All values represent the mean of at least three repeats. The double mutant M12C/N103C showed one of the higher values in multimer formation. These residues are predicted to interact in the closed MscL, and as can be seen in the western blot, the mutated protein exists exclusively as a pentamer after treatment with oxidizer (Fig. Three A, B). Furthermore, M12C/N103C single channel activity could only be seen after treatment with the reducing agent DTT, and the activity disappeared when oxidizer was added to the bath (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with M12C/N103C MscL being locked in a closed conformation when disulfide bridging occurs. Open in a new tab Figure 3. Bridging M12C/N103C mutant locks the channel in a closed state (A). The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues M12 (red) and N103 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure, which reflects a nearly closed state. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show how close these two residues are predicted to be. (B) Western blot of M12C/N103C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists almost exclusively as a pentamer (97% of total protein). (C) Patch clamp analysis of M12C/N103C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows differential activities under different redox conditions. The traces show the M12C/N103C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). After adding the reducing agent DTT to the bath (upper trace), channel activity could be observed; but after washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels were locked closed and could not be activated even at higher negative pressures. On the other side of the graph, one of the peaks reflecting multimerization is I3C/I96C. These residues are not predicted to interact in the closed structure of MscL, but still show that more than 50% of the protein in the western blot is forming multimers (Fig. Four A, B). Patch clamp experiments show that I3C/I96C single channel activity can be elicited both in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents in the bath (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a more detailed analysis of the amplitude of the channel in different redox conditions showed that in the presence of the oxidizer the channel is stabilized in a sub-conductive state (Fig. Four C, D). Open in a new tab Figure 4. Bridging I3C/I96C locks the channel into a sub-conducting state. (A) The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues I3 (red) and I96 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show that I3 and I96 are not predicted to interact with each other in the closed MscL channel. (B) Western blot of I3C/I96C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists in multiple states from dimmers to pentamers, with multimers (3X to 5X) representing 54% of total protein. (C) Patch clamp analysis of I3C/I96C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows that the channel locks in a sub-conductive stated under oxidizing conditions. The traces show the I3C/I96C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). Under reducing conditions DTT (upper trace) channel activity could be observed with most openings reaching a single conductive state (o). After washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels could still be activated but they stabilized in a sub-conductive state (s). (D) Amplitude histogram of traces from I3C/I96C patches under reducing (DTT red line) or oxidizing (peroxide blue line) conditions. Note that in the presence of peroxide a sub-conductive state is stabilized. Finally, to better understand the interactions occurring between S1 and TM2ci domains, an additional number of double mutants were analyzed by patch clamp and the results are shown in Figure 5. Mutants I3C/K97C, I3C/N100C and E6C/K101C showed, like I3C/I96C, stabilization in a sub-conductive state upon oxidation, but did not lock closed. The mutants M12C/R104C, M12C/N100C, E9C/K101C and E6C/I96C, similar to M12C/N103C, locked closed under oxidation; however, more substates were observed for mutants in the middle of the two regions and sensitivity to oxidation varied among mutants.

    "discussion": "Discussion MscL has been shown in previous studies to be, in general, quite tolerant of cysteine mutations.9 Perhaps partially because of this finding, cysteine trapping experiments have been utilized to address proximity of regions of the protein that are thought to interact. However, in some instances, researchers have been misled by utilizing targeted mutagenesis and disulfide trapping experiments, proposing models later shown to be false. For example, S1 was thought at one time to form a helical bundle that served as a second gate.18,19 The major form of evidence for this model was targeted disulfide trapping. However, when the entire region was scanned and disulfide trapping assessed and compared,15 the results were consistent with the newly re-evaluated structure7: S1 was an amphipathic helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane. There was no evidence that a S1 “second gate” was ever formed during the gating process. We have designed the experiments used in this study to avoid some of the many potential pitfalls of the disulfide trapping approach. First, we have not used a targeted approach. Instead, we have generated and screened 143 double cysteine mutants, which act as controls for each other; relative amounts of disulfide bridging can easily be assessed. Second, the amount of oxidant used was carefully titrated to yield the maximum range of disulfide bridging; none of the interactions were forced by high concentrations of oxidant. Indeed, the amounts used in this study are 100 times less than that used to study TM1/TM2 interactions, where the interactions may be more insular and transient upon gating.17 Finally, we use an in vivo approach in which the membrane proteins are not solubilized prior to being resuspended in SDS running buffer; hence disulfide bridges cannot form in mild detergents that would preserve the pentameric complex while possibly allowing more dynamic interactions not reflecting any normal physiological state. We believe that the following of these practices when utilizing a disulfide trapping approach yields a more true and interpretable set of data. Our current model for S1 function is that it serves as a stabilizer for the twisting and turning of the pore-forming first transmembrane domain.15 In addition, all current models for the structural changes that occur upon gating include a tilting of both transmembrane domains within the plane of the membrane. In addition to tilting, for TM1 several lines of evidence also suggest a clockwise “corkscrewing” of TM1 of almost 180°, as would be observed from the periplasm; these lines of evidence include EPR experiments,20 disulfide trapping experiments within the pore9 and between TM1 and TM2 upon gating,17 accessibility and gating influences of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET+ on TM cysteine mutants,21,22 and the engineering of heavy metal binding sites within the pore region.8 The S1 amphipathic helix, with its two conserved phenylalanines, is joined to this dynamic TM1 by a conserved flexible glycine residue at position 14 that has been shown to have functional significance.9,23 Such a helix running along the membrane is observed in many channels including the other mechanosensitive channel in bacteria, MscS,7,24 the “slide helix” of KirBac1.1,25 a putative amphipathic “gate anchor” domain studied in TRPY1,26 and several others where they may also serve as stabilizers. Although TM2 is not thought to “corkscrew” within the membrane, it is thought to tilt within it upon gating. Indeed, a recent study of the dynamics of the TM2ci region has shown that channel gating can be influenced by modifications that make this region more hydrophobic.27 One residue, N103, was even shown to transiently insert into the membrane during the gating process in a piston-like manner. Hence, this region shows a dynamics within and along the membrane upon channel opening. The proximity of the S1 and TM2ci regions is obvious in the closed M. tuberculosis MscL structure. An analysis of the equivalent residues to E. coli M12 and N103 is entirely consistent with our results that these residues, when mutated to cysteines, readily disulfide bridge and form a channel resistant to opening. On the other hand, several residue combinations, including the distal I3C and I96C, are not predicted to be close in the M. tuberculosis structure, do not lock the channel in the closed state when oxidized, but do stabilize substates. These data are consistent with the models for the dynamics of the S1 and TM2ci outlined above: upon gating the S1 helix slides along the cytoplasmic membrane, where it can interact with residues further up in the membrane portion of TM2 because of the tilting of this latter domain. Thus, overall the double cysteine mutants that bridge at high efficiency fall in two main categories: those that are predicted to be in close proximity from the closed structure and do lock the channel closed under oxidizing conditions, and those interactions consistent with the predicted sliding and tilting of these regions upon gating that show stabilized subconducting states when oxidized. Collectively, the data from this study, as well as many others, have led to a cohesive model of how MscL senses and responds to mechanical forces. We know, for instance, that MscL senses the tension in the membrane3; more specifically, changes within the lateral pressure profile.28 The observation that many other mechanosensors also have lower thresholds or are activated by amphipaths suggests this is a common stimulus for MS channels.29 Furthermore, the observation that the channel can function in a bilayer composed of phosphatidylcholine, which contains a zwitter-ionic headgroup not synthesized by E. coli, demonstrates that neither interactions with negatively charged lipids nor native lipid headgroups are required for normal MS channel activity.3 Both transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane, and TM1 rotates in a corkscrew fashion clockwise, as observed from the periplasm.1 Finally, this study has helped to define the interactions between the S1 and the TM2ci domains; the findings are consistent with the model of S1 maintaining its association with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus serving as a stabilizer for the pore-forming TM1, and the dynamics of the TM2ci subdomain and the predicted tilting of TM2 within the membrane.",

The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating. Keywords: mechanosensitive channel, MscL, disulfide trapping, protein-protein interactions, osmoregulationIntroduction The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) of E. coli is to date one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how channels sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.1 The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation2; upon a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane tension3 acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4 in response to membrane tensions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5 A crystal structure of MscL from the homolog M. tuberculosis has been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7 (Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now suggests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9 The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for the S. aureus ortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10 further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is a detergent-specific process11,12; hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here. Open in a new tab Figure 1. Schematic representation of MscL from the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis. (A) The scheme on the left represents a pentameric MscL in a closed state with the S1 and TM2ci domains, in which the cysteine substitutions were performed, highlighted for clarity. The approximate location of the membrane is shown with horizontal gray lines. A single subunit is shown on the right to indicate all different MscL domains. (B)The same model with CPK representation of its residues shows how close the S1 and TM2ci domains are predicted to be in the closed structure of MscL. In the bottom view it can be appreciated that the S1 and TM2ci domains of alternating subunits, not direct neighbors, interact with each other.Upon gating, the best evidence suggests that the two transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane; as they do so, the first transmembrane TM1 twists in a cork-screw-like manner in a clockwise direction (when observed from the periplasm), and the channel then opens like the iris of an old-fashion camera. Note that in the crystal structure a vestibule of the closed pore is observed within the periplasmic side of the membrane, with the pore constriction occurring in the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane domains. Several studies have shown that this cytoplasmic-constriction region is important for channel gating. The N-terminal helix (S1) lies along the membrane and has been shown necessary for channel gating13,14; It appears to anchor TM1 to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to guide its tilting within the membrane during the gating process.15,16 The region of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface, (TM2ci; Fig. 1), has also been shown to influence the gating process. One of the residues within this subdomain, N103, has been shown to be incorporated into the membrane upon gating, presumably to accommodate for the longer tilted TM domains in the open state. Several additional residues in the TM2ci region are also crucial for this transition, thus tuning the gating of the channel. Although the structural data from the MscL crystal structure shows that the S1 and TM2ci domains are in very close proximity (Fig. 1B), little is known about protein-protein interactions in this region and their possible influence in the gating process. In this study we use an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to screen 143 double cysteine mutants to generate a detailed map of protein-protein interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains. Furthermore, to understand the dynamics of these interactions during the closed to open transition in E. coli MscL, we analyze the effects in single channel activity of different redox conditions by patch clamp. Two sets of mutants have shown changes in their activities under different redox conditions and suggest a model consistent with a concerted motion of the S1 domain and TM2ci.Results In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2ci (F93-K105) residues in E. coli MscL channel (Fig. 1) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay.17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. To compare the likelihood of interactions between cysteine substituted residues from S1 and TM2ci domains, we measured the amount of protein existing as monomer through pentamers in western blots. We expressed the values as the percentage of multimers vs. the total protein. For the multimer value we counted only the trimers to pentamers because some single cysteine mutants in S1 can form dimers,15 thus leading to ambiguity. The 3D graph in Figure 2 summarizes our results. The X and Y axis are the residues from S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. Note that the graph shows a pattern where almost no multimer formation occurs between S1 and residues A95, M94 and F93, residues that are inside the membrane of TM2, while the strongest interactions occur between K105 to L102 and S1. Open in a new tab Figure 2. Interactions between cytoplasmic domains. The graph summarizes the results of the in vivo disulfide trapping experiments and compares the efficiency of multimer formation between 143 MscL double cysteine mutants. The y and x axis reflect the sequence of amino acids of the S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. The legend shows the color corresponding to each percentage value. All values represent the mean of at least three repeats.The double mutant M12C/N103C showed one of the higher values in multimer formation. These residues are predicted to interact in the closed MscL, and as can be seen in the western blot, the mutated protein exists exclusively as a pentamer after treatment with oxidizer (Fig. Three A, B). Furthermore, M12C/N103C single channel activity could only be seen after treatment with the reducing agent DTT, and the activity disappeared when oxidizer was added to the bath (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with M12C/N103C MscL being locked in a closed conformation when disulfide bridging occurs. Open in a new tab Figure 3. Bridging M12C/N103C mutant locks the channel in a closed state (A). The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues M12 (red) and N103 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure, which reflects a nearly closed state. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show how close these two residues are predicted to be. (B) Western blot of M12C/N103C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane).

(C) Patch clamp analysis of M12C/N103C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows differential activities under different redox conditions. The traces show the M12C/N103C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). After adding the reducing agent DTT to the bath (upper trace), channel activity could be observed; but after washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels were locked closed and could not be activated even at higher negative pressures.On the other side of the graph, one of the peaks reflecting multimerization is I3C/I96C. These residues are not predicted to interact in the closed structure of MscL, but still show that more than 50% of the protein in the western blot is forming multimers (Fig. Four A, B). Patch clamp experiments show that I3C/I96C single channel activity can be elicited both in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents in the bath (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a more detailed analysis of the amplitude of the channel in different redox conditions showed that in the presence of the oxidizer the channel is stabilized in a sub-conductive state (Fig. Four C, D). Open in a new tab Figure 4. Bridging I3C/I96C locks the channel into a sub-conducting state. (A) The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues I3 (red) and I96 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure.

(C) Patch clamp analysis of I3C/I96C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows that the channel locks in a sub-conductive stated under oxidizing conditions. The traces show the I3C/I96C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). Under reducing conditions DTT (upper trace) channel activity could be observed with most openings reaching a single conductive state (o). After washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels could still be activated but they stabilized in a sub-conductive state (s). (D) Amplitude histogram of traces from I3C/I96C patches under reducing (DTT red line) or oxidizing (peroxide blue line) conditions. Note that in the presence of peroxide a sub-conductive state is stabilized.Finally, to better understand the interactions occurring between S1 and TM2ci domains, an additional number of double mutants were analyzed by patch clamp and the results are shown in Figure 5. Mutants I3C/K97C, I3C/N100C and E6C/K101C showed, like I3C/I96C, stabilization in a sub-conductive state upon oxidation, but did not lock closed. The mutants M12C/R104C, M12C/N100C, E9C/K101C and E6C/I96C, similar to M12C/N103C, locked closed under oxidation; however, more substates were observed for mutants in the middle of the two regions and sensitivity to oxidation varied among mutants.

In a simplified version of the 3D graph shown in Figure 2, the multimer peaks for seven additional mutants are highlighted with red (mutants that lock close upon oxidation) or green (do not lock close upon oxidation). The inserts show the corresponding position in M. tuberculosis model of the substituted residues in E. coli MscL. Just two subunits are shown for clarity; residues in green are in S1 and those in red in TM2ci. For each mutant the traces show single channel activity under reducing (black) or oxidizing (blue) conditions. The number under each trace is the negative pressure applied to the patch.

Although TM2 is not thought to “corkscrew” within the membrane, it is thought to tilt within it upon gating. Indeed, a recent study of the dynamics of the TM2ci region has shown that channel gating can be influenced by modifications that make this region more hydrophobic.27 One residue, N103, was even shown to transiently insert into the membrane during the gating process in a piston-like manner. Hence, this region shows a dynamics within and along the membrane upon channel opening. The proximity of the S1 and TM2ci regions is obvious in the closed M. tuberculosis MscL structure. An analysis of the equivalent residues to E. coli M12 and N103 is entirely consistent with our results that these residues, when mutated to cysteines, readily disulfide bridge and form a channel resistant to opening. On the other hand, several residue combinations, including the distal I3C and I96C, are not predicted to be close in the M. tuberculosis structure, do not lock the channel in the closed state when oxidized, but do stabilize substates. These data are consistent with the models for the dynamics of the S1 and TM2ci outlined above: upon gating the S1 helix slides along the cytoplasmic membrane, where it can interact with residues further up in the membrane portion of TM2 because of the tilting of this latter domain. Thus, overall the double cysteine mutants that bridge at high efficiency fall in two main categories: those that are predicted to be in close proximity from the closed structure and do lock the channel closed under oxidizing conditions, and those interactions consistent with the predicted sliding and tilting of these regions upon gating that show stabilized subconducting states when oxidized. Collectively, the data from this study, as well as many others, have led to a cohesive model of how MscL senses and responds to mechanical forces. We know, for instance, that MscL senses the tension in the membrane3; more specifically, changes within the lateral pressure profile.28 The observation that many other mechanosensors also have lower thresholds or are activated by amphipaths suggests this is a common stimulus for MS channels.29 Furthermore, the observation that the channel can function in a bilayer composed of phosphatidylcholine, which contains a zwitter-ionic headgroup not synthesized by E. coli, demonstrates that neither interactions with negatively charged lipids nor native lipid headgroups are required for normal MS channel activity.3 Both transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane, and TM1 rotates in a corkscrew fashion clockwise, as observed from the periplasm.1 Finally, this study has helped to define the interactions between the S1 and the TM2ci domains; the findings are consistent with the model of S1 maintaining its association with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus serving as a stabilizer for the pore-forming TM1, and the dynamics of the TM2ci subdomain and the predicted tilting of TM2 within the membrane.Materials and Methods Strains and cell growth E. coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL::Cm)30 was used as host for the pB10 expression constructs.14,30-32 PB104 was used for the in vivo cysteine trapping experiments and for the generation of spheroplasts for electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) media (Fisher Scientific) plus ampicillin (100 mg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cpm. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace).Generations of mutants Single mutants were generated using the mega primer technique as described.9 The double mutants were generated by digesting with restriction enzymes NsiI and BamHI, which separate the DNA encoding TM1 from that encoding TM2. The two fragments encoding the cysteine mutations were then ligated to generate the insert encoding the double cysteine mutants.In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB + ampicillin (approximately 410mOsmolar). LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a Criterion 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for western blot analysis.17 Note that in less than 5 min the samples are collected and loaded on the gel. Gels were run at 200 V for 55 min. and transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P (Millipore) in Tris-Glycine, 15% methanol and 0.01% SDS for 70 min. at 110V. After blocking, the primary antibody, anti- MscL was diluted to 1:15,000 and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, the secondary antibody, goat anti rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), was diluted to 1:100,000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed and developed with Millipore HRP substrate for 5 min and exposed to film.Disulfide trapping quantification The density of the bands was measured with Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The bands in each lane were measured as two sets, monomer and dimer, and trimers to pentamers (multimers). The values are expressed as the percentage of total protein existing as multimers.Electrophysiology E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.33 Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions using a buffer containing 200mM KCl, 90mM MgCl2, 10mM CaCl2, and 5mM HEPES pH 6 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To study redox effects in channel activity H2O2 1–3% v/v or dithiothreitol (DTT) 1–10 mM (Sigma) were added to the bath. A previous study has demonstrated that this treatment has no detrimental effect on channel function.34 Recordings were performed at -20 mV (positive pipette). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to monitor the pressure throughout the experiments. Data were analyzed using Clampfit9 from pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments).Acknowledgments The authors graciously acknowledge their financial support.

Of particular note are the adaptations to high osmolarity, but these adaptations in themselves have required the evolution of strategies to deal with transitions in the environment from high to low osmolarity. To understand the latter, we need to describe the former. Bacterial adaptation to high osmolarity is multiphasic and engages the full panoply of cellular regulatory mechanisms, be they controls over gene expression or modulation of protein activity. Understanding the importance of these regulatory mechanisms requires an appreciation of the core physiology of the bacterial cell.CORE PHYSIOLOGY AND IONIC BALANCE All bacterial cells that possess a semirigid cell wall containing peptidoglycan accumulate high concentrations of solutes in their cytoplasm to generate and sustain an outwardly directed turgor pressure over the range of osmolarities at which they grow. In Gram-negative bacteria, the accumulation of potassium glutamate to concentrations well above those required for biochemical reactions or regulation of cytoplasmic pH is a common aspect of core physiology. Even at low limiting osmolarity (i.e., close to that level below which growth does not occur due to nutrient depletion), potassium concentrations approximate ∼100 to 200 mM (28). Potassium is matched by fixed charges on macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and protein) and by osmotically active anions, principally glutamate, but with contributions from a myriad of other metabolic anions that are intermediates in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (69). Although estimates of cell turgor are very difficult to derive experimentally, the calculated values suggest that at low osmolarity, turgor pressure may be as high as 4 atm (56) (but see also recent work using atomic force microscopy that has suggested much lower turgor [24]). Sudden increases in external osmolarity are followed by a series of physical and biochemical events that all lead to further accumulation of solutes, such that at high osmolarity, solute concentrations in the cytoplasm vastly exceed those outside the cell (16). Many organisms have been studied, and detailed responses have been reported for Bacillus, Staphylococcus, lactobacilli, cyanobacteria, and Listeria; the best-described responses are those characterized for Escherichia coli and Salmonella (16, 30, 33, 40, 60, 82, 83). The first cellular response is purely osmotic—water leaves the cytoplasm down the osmotic gradient, causing cell shrinkage or plasmolysis. The first major physiological response is release of feedback control over potassium uptake, such that this cation accumulates rapidly, leading to both stimulation of glutamate synthesis and reversal of the water loss (27). Secondary phases, namely, the transient induction of the kdp operon, which can be sustained if the external K+ concentration is insufficient to restore an outward turgor pressure, follow. The internal K+ concentrations under high osmotic environments can exceed 1 M. This may be followed by the induced expression of trehalose biosynthesis enzymes and the stimulation of their activity by the accumulated K-glutamate. If compatible solutes (betaine, proline, ectoine) or their precursors (choline) are available, then a further phase of adaptation sees the accumulation of these solutes to several hundred millimolar (depending on the external osmolarity) and the lowering of the cytoplasmic K-glutamate pool (82). Thus, depending on both the osmolarity of the environment and its chemical composition, the cell may have very different cytoplasmic constitutions.THE CHALLENGE OF HYPOOSMOTIC SHOCK Such adapted cells are exposed to a major threat to their physical integrity if the environment suddenly changes to one of low osmolarity. For example, a transition from seawater (∼1,000 mosM) to freshwater (10 to 100 mosM) reflects a change in turgor of approximately 22 atm, simply due to the lowering of the external osmolarity (by the Van't Hoff Law, the osmotic pressure in atm, Π, in dilute solutions is calculated by the equation Π = RT∑ci, where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and ci is the molar concentration of solute I; thus, 40 mosM = ∼1 atm). Of course, such osmotic transitions are not confined to marine bacteria and would be threats to soil bacteria upon rain, intestinal bacteria upon feces excretion into water, and even host-obligatory microbes upon transmission, when saliva or other secretions may partially dry before being taken up by a new victim. The high concentration of solutes in the cell that exists before the transition draws water into the cell. Water permeability of the lipid bilayer is high and is augmented, in general, by aquaporins. Consequently, the lowering of the external osmolarity generates a huge influx of water that creates a force acting outwards against the cell wall (note that here the cell wall is taken to be composed of both the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane to which it is attached; see references 75 and 79 for recent insights). Rapid action is required if the cell is to survive intact. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels were discovered in bacteria 25 years ago and were predicted to play a role in solute release in response to excessive turgor (51). Indeed, the existence of transient pore formation in the cell wall and membrane was predicted long before their characterization by electrophysiology, biochemistry, genetics, and structural biology (19). The eventual confirmation of the roles of mechanosensitive channels in sustaining physical integrity arose out of the discovery of the genes for the two major mechanosensitive channels in E. coli, namely, MscS (mechanosensitive channel small conductance) and MscL (large conductance) (46, 74). Both actually have very large conductances, or pore sizes, relative to eukaryotic channels, which are usually on the order of a few tens of picosiemens; MscL, at 3.6 nanosiemens, is the largest gated channel known, while MscS conductance is 1 nanosiemen. Although they release excess cell turgor, these channels appear to sense tension within the membrane rather than the pressure across it. This is best documented for the MscL channel (57); it appears to sense the biophysical properties of the membrane, specifically lipid bilayer deformation (67). The presence of either of these channels is sufficient to confer significant protection against rapid hypoosmotic shock (downshock) (46, 59) (see reference 17 for a schematic representation). These two channels reflect distinct families of proteins. As discussed below, the MscS family is quite diverse and a single organism may encode multiple members in their genome, presumably to be expressed and/or activated under distinct environmental cues. The MscL channel is highly conserved, with only a single gene found in any given organism, and its activation appears to be a last-ditch effort for survival. One of the best exemplars of this trend comes from the first demonstration of the protective effects of MS channels. Vibrio alginolyticus grows in marine environments and lyses when transferred to low osmolarity. Lysis can be prevented by expressing E. coli MscL from a plasmid (62). The genome of this organism, along with those for many other Vibrio species, has subsequently been sequenced. Almost all lack the gene for MscL but possess multiple MscS homologues. The implication is that either the activity or the expression level of the latter MscS-type channels is insufficient to protect, at least under experimental conditions. An even greater curiosity is the exception to this rule—Vibrio cholerae (and the related species Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio mimicus); this is the group of organisms that are largely halophilic pathogens but that often require exposure to low osmolarity for transmission. During diarrhea brought on by cholera toxin and their transmission through contaminated drinking water, they are exposed to hypoosmotic shock. Thus, acquisition (retention) of MscL by V. cholerae might be an adaptation to the pathogenic niche.MscS FAMILY The MscS channel was the first activity defined by electrophysiology (51), although it is not clear whether the observed channels were the product of a single gene or two different channels of similar conductance that have subsequently been characterized (46). The identification of the canonical MscS channel was a critical event, opening a path to the description of a wide family of channel homologues of great complexity (68). The E. coli MscS (MscS-Ec) is a 286-amino-acid (aa) protein that assembles to a homoheptameric complex. Most organisms possess multiple homologues that share a region similar in overall composition and predicted structure to that of MscS-Ec at their carboxy-terminal end. In all homologues studied to date, the amino acid sequence is most conserved in the region that has been defined by crystallography in MscS-Ec as the pore-forming TM3A helix and the region immediately carboxy-terminal to this, the TM3B helix and the β domain. Other regions are conserved specifically within the subfamilies that are defined by the structural variation within the wider MscS family. MscS homologues exhibit additional amino-terminal transmembrane (TM) helices, and some also exhibit a periplasmic domain (46). One usually finds an additional either eight helices or two helices (based on hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequences) (Fig. 1). Our unpublished studies show that all the homologues in E. coli exhibit mechanosensitivity in patch clamp electrophysiology and can protect cells in downshock assays. The reasons that such channels are not seen in the E. coli mutant strain MJF465, which lacks the readily detectable MscS, MscK, and MscL channels, are complex and beyond the immediate scope of this review. While the large majority of MscS homologues have additional amino-terminal TM domains, a smaller group of homologues have modifications to the carboxy-terminal domain. The YbdG family has an ∼50-amino-acid insertion between the upper β and lower αβ domains that form the majority of the cytoplasmic domain (70). Other homologues have been reported to exhibit extensions at their carboxy termini such that the “alpha-beta” domain is replaced by a unique protein sequence (e.g., MscS-Cg [Fig. 1]). Still others may be evolutionarily related to MscS but have largely either lost or diminished their mechanosensitive properties (20). Fig 1. Open in a new tab Hydrophobicity plots (window = 19) showing MscS-Ec (blue) and representatives of the largest (MscK-Ec; green) and intermediate-sized (YnaI-Ec; yellow) members of the MscS family. In addition, MscS-Cg, which is an MscS homologue from Corynebacterium glutamicum that is similar to MscS along its length from the amino terminus to the base of the β domain, is shown. Thereafter, the sequences diverge, and the MscS-Cg protein has a long, essentially cytoplasmic extension (note, however, that this domain contains a potential transmembrane span located 300 amino acids after the end of β domain). The hydrophobicity plot scale is ±4.5 units, and any segment averaged over 19 residues that has a value above 1.8 at any point in the window has the potential to form a transmembrane span (44). A scale bar representing 100 amino acids is shown, and all the homologues are on the same scale.MscS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The core domain of MscS-Ec comprises three TM domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3A), an amphipathic helix (TM3B) that lies along the membrane surface and projects into the cytoplasm, a β domain, a mixed αβ domain, and a carboxy-terminal β sheet (Fig. 2A) (8). The assembled cytoplasmic domains in the homoheptamer form a large balloon-like structure that is delimited at the membrane surface by the entrance to the pore defined by the seven TM3A helices and at the base by a β barrel that is both narrow and lined with hydrophobic residues, such that it is unlikely that either water or solutes can pass. Ions and solutes access the transmembrane pore by passing through lateral portals created at the interfaces between the β and αβ domains (Fig. 2A). Although the primary descriptions of the structure of MscS-Ec have been via crystallography, there have also been important contributions from other biophysical approaches, in particular, continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) of MscS-Ec mutants in which cysteine residues have been introduced (71, 76, 77). Fig 2. Open in a new tab (A) Structure of the closed form of MscS-Ec (2oau) (8, 72). (B) Depiction of TM3A helix movements associated with forming an open state (reprinted from reference 80). (A) A single subunit of the homoheptamer is colored black and is shown integrated into (right) and separate from (left) the MscS structure. Each distinct structural element is labeled. (B) The closed (left) MscS pore viewed from the periplasmic face. Residues T93 to N117 only are shown in space-filled mode (pink), with a single subunit indicated in crimson. The leucine rings form visible blocks to ion conduction by creating a hydrophobic constriction that, despite appearing to be open, is constrained in its ability to pass water and ions (see the text). An open structure, obtained by crystallization of a mutant, A106V MscS-Ec, is shown (right; yellow) with a single subunit highlighted (orange). The closed pore has a diameter of ∼4.8 Å, and the open pore has a diameter of ∼13 Å (80). The radial movement of the TM3A helices, accompanied by a small rotation, completely removes the seal residues (L105 and L109) from the center of the channel, leaving a large open pore.The membrane-embedded domain can be considered to have two components: TM1-TM2 (TM1-2) and TM3a. TM1-2 form a helix pair that is predicted to move in the bilayer as a rigid body sensing bilayer tension (80). Movements of this helix pair are considered to trigger changes in the packing of the TM3A helices, generating an open pore from the closed state (Fig. 2B). The TM3A helices are tightly packed, and they appear in crystal structures to be in a semisymmetrical arrangement (61). The interfaces of the helices are composed of matching knobs and grooves created from a semiconserved pattern of Gly and Ala residues (8, 26). The seal that prevents solute ingress or exit in the absence of a triggering signal is composed of two rings of Leu residues (L105 and L109 in MscS-Ec). Mutations at these positions that decrease the hydrophobicity of the seal lead to channels that gate at lower tensions than the parental channel (26, 54, 55). Sukharev and colleagues have proposed that the hydrophobicity of the seal residues creates a zone that is not readily hydrated, and thus, in the absence of a continuous water phase in the pore, no ions can pass despite an apparently open pore that is approximately 4 to 5 Å in diameter in the crystal structure (4). The mechanism of sensing membrane tension remains controversial, and the structural transitions during gating are still in dispute. What is clear is that the opening of the channel requires the movement apart of the leucine residues that constitute the seal (Fig. 2B). Sukharev has estimated that the open pore must have a diameter of 14 to 16 Å (73). We solved the structure of an open form of a mutant (A106V) of the MscS-Ec channel in 2008 and found that the open pore in this crystalline state had a diameter of ∼13 to 14 Å (80). Moreover, the HOLE program predicted that this structure may have a conductance equal to that reported for MscS. Such predictions are always perilous, but the overall open structure of A106V is consistent with the requirements for ion conduction. Namely, the leucine residues have rotated away from the center of the pore with the side chains in a more peripheral location and the TM3A helices have moved outwards from the center (Fig. 2B). A specific prediction made by the structure is that in the open state, TM3A helices have moved apart, breaking the Ala-Gly interface. We have reasoned that the pivotal role identified for the Ala-Gly interface is in the guidance of the helices in the initial stages of the closed-open transition and vice versa (26). Consistent with this, we have shown that one specific mutation to the Ala-Gly interface (A102G) does not block the opening of the channel but does severely diminish the stability of the open state, as if the channel initiates the structural transition toward the open state and then collapses back due to the absence of the stabilizing Ala residue. The new structure also allowed speculation about an arcane property of MscS-Ec—the inactivation of MscS-Ec channels exposed to increased bilayer tension. One explanation that we posited from the new structure is that the unstable nature of the pore helices in the open state increases the probability that rather than an ordered return to the closed state, one or more helices collapse into the pore, leading to a nonrecoverable block (80). Much has been written about the inactivation of this channel (1, 3, 10, 15). However, this property is unlikely to be a core feature of the MscS family and thus may be just one more variation on the theme. Other mechanosensitive channels that are variants on MscS, e.g., MscMJ and MscMJLR from Methanococcoides jannaschii (41) and MscCG (18), do not show inactivation in the experiments that have been described. Similarly, MscK does not inactivate (46). We have recently reviewed in detail the structural transitions associated with gating (80). There is common ground among the groups working on these channels that TM1-2 senses tension and moves in such a way as to transmit a conformational change via the TM2-TM3A linker that, in turn, generates the opening twist that is required to initiate the transition from closed to open. Space does not allow a revisiting of all the arguments and proposed structures. Safe to say that much remains to be done in this area, and new approaches are essential if definitive progress is to be made.MscL FAMILY: CONTRASTS WITH MscS MscL contrasts with MscS on many levels. While several species are predicted to contain multiple MscS proteins, usually only one MscL is found. It is almost ubiquitous throughout the bacterial kingdom but is not observed in plants, whereas MscS is (31). Instead, a simple BLAST search shows that MscL is found in numerous members of the fungal and oomycete kingdoms, including the genera Phytophthora, Neurospora, Myceliophthora, Piriformospora, and Batrachochytrium. The location of these channels in the cell is far from clear, and no analysis of cellular location has been reported. In contrast, the plant MscS homologues have been found in both organelles and plant cell membranes (78, 81). As indicated above, MscL is absent from most Vibrio species. But MscL is also found in the majority of Mycoplasma species. This is perhaps an unexpected finding given the wall-less nature of these organisms. The most bizarre of these is the MscL observed in Mycoplasma gallisepticum, in which the protein is predicted to be 220 amino acids in length (the MscL-Ec protein is typically 136 aa), and only the first part of the protein to the beginning of the periplasmic loop is conserved. Again, MscS is absent from nearly all the mycoplasmas, being present only in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Thus, MscL distribution among microbes does vary and might be specifically lowered in abundance among marine species. MscL is highly conserved (5, 52, 68). Except for the mycoplasma MscL domain structure noted above, it always contains the following conserved domains: an amphipathic α helix (S1) that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane, a highly conserved first transmembrane domain (TM1) that forms the pore constriction, a periplasmic loop, a second transmembrane domain (TM2) that faces the lipid membrane, and a linker that leads to a cytoplasmic α-helical bundle. Two crystal structures have been resolved: a pentameric Mycobacterium tuberculosis MscL (MscL-Tb) (21) and a tetrameric Staphylococcus aureus MscL (50); however, we now know that, in vivo, S. aureus MscL is pentameric, not tetrameric, with the tetrameric structure resolved in the crystal being a detergent-dependent oligomeric rearrangement (25, 36); thus, only the former structure is shown in Fig. 3. The small variations between orthologues lie in the length of the N-terminal region (sometimes having numerous residues prior to the predicted S1 helix) and the length and sequence of the periplasmic loop, and some orthologues contain numerous amino acids after the predicted cytoplasmic helical bundle (52). However, this variability is extremely modest compared with that of MscS. Of the MscL orthologue channels that have been characterized electrophysiologically (29, 58, 59), the differences in channel activities observed are also relatively modest. Some differences in mechanosensitivity and kinetics and perhaps a 25% variability in conductance have been observed; none of the MscL channels have been found to be dependent upon ionic conditions or other factors, as may be the case for the diverse MscS family of channels (47). Finally, the presence of a single MscL per organism is consistent with a channel that is highly conserved both structurally and functionally. Fig 3. Open in a new tab Current models of the MscL channel. The top panels depict the crystal structure obtained for MscL-Tb, as observed across the plane of the membrane, with the approximate locations of the membrane shown as horizontal lines (left) or from the periplasmic side of the membrane (right); note the black arrow in the latter near the green subunit which describes the corkscrew movement of TM1 that is predicted to occur early in the gating process. In the top center, a single subunit is shown in isolation to better show the domains: S1 is the N-terminal amphipathic α helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane, TM1 and TM2 are the transmembrane domains, Peri Loop is the periplasmic loop connecting them, and Cyto Helix is the cytoplasmic helical bundle. The bottom panels show a model for the positions of the transmembrane domains in the open structure, as derived from EPR and other studies and as indicated in the text. Note the tilting of these domains within the membrane.As mentioned above, MscL appears to be a last-ditch effort for survival (11). Functionally, MscL can be redundant with MscS channels in that it protects the organism from osmotic shock (note, however, that this needs to be formally demonstrated for fungal and mycoplasma organisms). Double-null (i.e., MscL− MscS−) E. coli strains are robust organisms under most conditions, including osmotic balancing when compatible solutes are accumulated and K+ is released. However, they are osmotically fragile during hypoosmotic shock (46). They can be rescued by either MscS or MscL expressed from the chromosome (i.e., the normal levels of expression of either channel are sufficient to prevent major loss of viability). This is akin to the rescue demonstrated for V. alginolyticus referred to above, but in this organism, there is the anomaly of the presence of multiple MscS homologues in the chromosome. MscL, when open, makes very large pores in the membrane that are ∼30 Å in diameter, as determined by molecular sieving experiments for the E. coli MscL (23), making it the largest gated pore known. As one would expect for such a large pore, keeping it closed is a priority for the cell. Indeed, a plethora of genetic evidence now indicates that if this channel is gated inappropriately, such that it opens at low membrane tensions, its presence is devastating for the cell (6, 9, 53, 65).THE RESILIENCE OF THE MscL PROTEIN ALLOWS IN VIVO GENETIC STUDIES TO DEFINE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR UPON GATING Given that MscL is so highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, one might suspect that small changes would result in radically different phenotypes in channel activities. This, however, appears not to be the case. On the order of 90% of single-residue changes yield little or no discernible cellular phenotype (45). This “resilience” has been advantageous for the study of the channel using both random and site-directed mutagenesis, as well as for in vivo screens, thus allowing for a relatively unique handle on the system. Such approaches have led the way for the proposal of new models for channel gating, as well as for supporting or refuting existing ones. In an initial study, a randomly mutated MscL-Ec was expressed in a mscL-null host cell in trans using an inducible promoter (65). The expression levels were relatively low, only a few fold higher than those of the endogenous gene (14). The bacteria were initially plated on noninducing plates, and then replica plating was used to transfer the grown colonies onto plates containing IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) to induce expression. Cells that showed a slowed- or no-growth gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype on the IPTG-containing plates were isolated from the parental plate and further characterized. The severity of these GOF phenotypes correlated well with a left shift of the sensitivity curve, as assayed by patch clamp, demonstrating that the channels became more sensitive to membrane tension. Many of the mutations were in TM1, which, we now know from the crystal structure, lines the pore. Of these mutations, almost all were changes to more-hydrophilic residues, which led to the notion that an increase in hydrophilicity within the pore led to channels that are more sensitive to bilayer tension. Subsequent studies yielded similar findings and also highlighted residues at the aqueous/lipid interface as being important (45, 53, 86). Since these initial random mutagenesis studies, several additional studies have used in vivo screens to deduce the structural changes that occur upon gating. For example, random mutagenesis designed to isolate intragenic suppressors of known GOF mutants supported a model for a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasm), or “corkscrewing,” of TM1, almost 180°, occurring upon the gating process (48); such a rotation had been predicted from EPR studies (66). This model was later additionally supported by a new in vivo technique to test channel opening, coined the electrostatic repulsion test (ESReT) (49). Disulfide trapping of closed channels (45) and the engineering of heavy-metal-binding sites within the pore (34) have also supported the corkscrew model. One of the more-unique approaches used allows the in vivo posttranslational modification of the channel. Here, cysteine mutants are expressed in mscL-null cells, sulfhydryl reagents with specific properties are added to the medium, often upon osmotic downshock, and viability is determined. This approach was initially used for a single cysteine mutant within the pore that was modified with the positively charged sulfhydryl MTSET+ (9) but later expanded as a screen for an entire cysteine library (6). For this positively charged compound, the predominant hits were again within the pore and supported the TM1 corkscrew model. More recently, hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagents have also been used (35) and have led to a model in which a residue at the TM2 cytoplasmic interface transiently interacts with the lipid membrane upon gating (35). Hence, these rapid in vivo screens have been invaluable in supporting and suggesting models for many of the structural changes that occur upon gating. In sum, the in vivo screens, when combined with other studies, have led to the following model for gating. First, some data indicate that the crystal structure may be close to, but not completely in, the fully closed state in vivo (34, 45). TM2 senses the biophysical perturbation in the membrane under tension. Thinning of the membrane is not what is sensed; instead, it is probably changes in the lateral pressure profile (67). Although the regions at or near the membrane interface are important (53, 86), direct interactions with specific head groups do not appear to be important for normal function (57); indeed, when such interactions are created, they can be disadvantageous (86). Both TM1 and TM2 tilt within the membrane (66), while the first transmembrane helix rotates in a corkscrew fashion (6, 7, 34, 66). The channel then presumably opens like the iris of a camera, with TM1 forming the pore (6, 7, 66). The N-terminal amphipathic helix remains along the cytoplasmic membrane, where it serves as a stabilizer for TM1 as it tilts and rotates (22, 37). This stabilizer is sometimes called a “slide helix” or “anchor” and is seen in several channels, suggesting a more conserved function (37). Although initially controversial (2, 87), it now appears that the C-terminal bundle remains intact in the open structure, with the TM2-to-bundle linker creating five portals that can act as potential molecular sieves (85), while the TM2 cytoplasmic interface appears to be dynamic and enters the membrane during the gating process (35).CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SPECULATIONS It has been a given for many years that both MscS and MscL fulfill major roles in protecting cell integrity by serving the function of biological emergency release valves (46). However, while this is true, there may be many exceptions to this rule that have yet to be elucidated. Some key questions can be defined. (i) Do all bacterial MS channels, irrespective of their structure, play only the role of emergency release valve? Unambiguously, this is not the case for E. coli, for which there are five MS channels that do not fulfill this role (68). Alternative roles might be found in the work on chloroplast MS channels (78). These belong to the MscS family, and hints that they may influence shape maintenance and organelle division have arisen from their study (31, 32). Given that chloroplasts are intracytoplasmic, they have no need to survive major changes in osmolarity. However, they might be essential in adjusting chloroplast volume during day/night cycles. A change in solute pools of around 40 mM is equivalent to ∼1 atm, and therefore, variations in the concentrations of carbon cycle intermediates and other metabolites may be a significant stress. In isolated membranes (i.e., patch clamp), channels may have thresholds measured in 0.1 atm (∼4 mM solute change) and thus might be engaged in metabolite pool management. While this would still be an osmotic role, protein colocalization studies have suggested proximity between chloroplast division machinery and the MS channels and this may couple osmotic changes to shape control and division. (ii) What do the differing portfolios of mechanosensitive channel homologues tell us about evolution to niche and/or creation of modified functions associated with MS channels? We have alluded above to the observed differences in MS channel distribution from the “norm.” Both Mycoplasma and Vibrio species may have modified their profiles of MS channels to reflect their major environmental hurdles. Can we learn more about an organism's niche from an evaluation of gene profiles and their expression matrices? (iii) How many copies of a channel does the cell need for survival? Recent work has suggested that, in contrast to previous studies, MscL may exist at >200 channels per cell (12). Many studies have shown that channel abundance in membrane patches does not always correlate with measured channel activity. Thus, do all channels exist in multiple states, only some of which are poised to be activated (15, 38)? (iv) In fungi, where are the MscL channels subcellularly? What is their function, and how do localization and function match up? Could these channels have a role in the complex life cycle that some fungi and oomycetes undertake, which often includes severe transitions in osmolyte and water content? (v) Can the conserved nature of MscS and MscL be the Achilles' heel for bacteria? Much work has established the toxicity of MscL, MscS, MscK, and MscG mutants that gate inappropriately (6, 45, 47, 53–55, 64, 65). Can we trigger gating using chemicals and, in this way, generate new antibiotics that act synergistically with compounds that weaken bacterial cell envelopes? Such speculation has been made previously (13, 39, 63). In theory, the conserved nature of MscL can be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antimicrobials. (vi) Bacterial mechanosensitive channels are some of the largest gated pores; MscL is perhaps the largest known (23). Seminal research has shown how these nanopores can be utilized for the delivery of peptides and other membrane-impermeable compounds. Indeed, the observation that a charge within the MscL pore can gate the channel has led to the engineering of nanopores that are actuated by light (43) and pH (42). We can now not only change the modality of MscL but also control the compounds that may pass through it (84), as well as reversibly modulate the pore size (85). Such channels may someday be utilized in a variety of nanodevices, including targeted drug delivery systems. Mechanosensitive channels have provided a paradigm for transient pore formation in bacterial membranes for almost 20 years. Much has been discovered about the structures and some of the structural transitions that they undertake. Yet much still remains to be discovered about the precise structural changes associated with the open and transition states, and these channels remain fertile ground for technology development. At the end of the day, we know a lot about these mechanosensitive channels in E. coli. However, there are clues in abundance that MscS-Ec and MscL-Ec are but two stories and that there are many more to be told that will reveal new insights into the way nature has developed and evolved this fascinating class of membrane proteins.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge our financial support.

    "abstract": "Summary MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, functionally serves as an osmotic “emergency release valve”, is among the best studied mechanosensors and a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to membrane tension. While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested E. coli and S aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure.

    "introduction": "Introduction The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a; Blount et al., 2007; Blount et al., 2008b; Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels from Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012; Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009; Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch. X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998; Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also see Fig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamers in vivo (Dorwart et al., 2010; Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family. Figure 1. The crystal structure of Tb-MscL and alignment of MscL homologs. Open in a new tab A: Crystal structure of Tb-MscL. a homopentamer with each subunit having two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by periplasmic loop (peri-loop) marked in blue, an N-terminal cytoplasmic helix (S1) connected to TM1, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical bundle connected to TM2 by a short cytoplasmic loop. The amino acid shown in red is G47 in Tb- MscL, which is equivalent to F47 in S. aureus and I49 in E. coli MscL. B. Sequence alignment of MscL homologs from E. coli (Eco-MscL) and S. aureus (Sa-MscL). Included in blue boxes are identical and similar residues in the E. coli and S. aureus MscL protein. The arrows and bold labels show the identified analogous amino acid in Eco- and Sa-MscL. The schematic illustration of MscL is also shown above the sequence alignment with S1, TM1, TM2 and c-terminal helix domains shown as boxes and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops shown as lines. Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005; Maurer et al., 2000; Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has a sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% with E. coli MscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that a site at the membrane interface plays such a crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment.",

    "results": "Results The periplasmic region of the channel plays a major role in defining channel kinetics In an attempt to correlate channel kinetics with specific regions of the protein, numerous chimeras of the Eco- and Sa-MscL channel proteins were generated. Figure 1 shows the locations of different domains of the protein imposed upon the crystal structure of the Tb-MscL (panel a) as well as the sequence alignment of the Eco- and Sa-MscL proteins (panel b). The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as follows: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. As shown in Figure 2, recording the single channel openings of many Eco- and Sa-MscL chimeras revealed a pattern in channel open dwell time. Figure 2A shows chimeras with very short open dwell times, similar to wild type Sa-MscL. Chimeras in this panel share a common sequence in what is essentially the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface of the Sa-MscL, specifically amino acids (aa) 44-49. In contrast to chimeras shown in Figure 2A, channels shown in Figure 2B share a common sequence in the same region which, instead is from Eco-MscL. These chimeras also contain the periplasmic loop and beginning of TM2 from Eco-MscL, thus giving a total Eco-MscL domain of aa 44-77. This common sequence correlates with longer open dwell times, similar to the Eco-MscL activities. Figure 2. E. coli and S. aureus MscL chimeras reveal regions that strongly correlate with MscL channel open dwell time. Open in a new tab The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as following: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. Schematic illustration of each chimera is shown in the left with open boxes and black lines representing domains from E. coli MscL, while filled blue boxes and blue lines showing those from S. aureus MscL. Typical traces, with the appropriate scale bars, are shown at the right of each chimera. Specific areas of the protein that correlate with kinetics are boxed with red boxes highlighting the regions that correlate with long open dwell times and green boxes labeling the regions relevant to short channel kinetics. The chimeras have been grouped as discussed in text. Panel e shows a schematic summary showing the regions identified to be important in channel kinetics.The analyses of additional chimeras demonstrated that different subdomains of this entire periplasmic region, aa 44-77, effect different behaviors in channel kinetics. The most dramatic example is seen in Figure 2C, where we found that if a channel contains the TM1 periplasmic region of Eco-MscL, aa 44-49, as well as the periplasmic loop region from Sa-MscL, aa 50-77, a super-long open dwell time channel is produced, thus suggesting that both regions lead to stabilization of the open state; note that the time scale of the two chimeras in this panel is 86-fold and 140-fold of that for chimeras shown in panels a and b, respectively. This latter observation allows us to make some predictions. It first suggests that a combination of Sa-MscL “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL 44-49 and Eco-MscL aa 50-77 should yield a channel with “super-short” channel kinetics. While Figure 2A is consistent with this prediction, it cannot be rigorously tested; the equipment used cannot easily resolve channel openings below 1ms, which is approximately the longest opening for the Sa-MscL channel. However, it also predicts that a combination of the “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 44-49 with the “lengthening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 50-77 in an Eco-MscL background would lead to a channel with intermediate kinetics, perhaps not dissimilar to Eco-MscL. Indeed, as seen in Figure 2D, this prediction is upheld. Since aa 50-77 contains both the non-conserved periplasmic loop (aa 50-74) as well as the highly conserved beginning of TM2 (aa 75-77), the different effect of aa 50-77 from Sa- and Eco-MscL is very likely generated by differences in the periplasmic loop (aa 50-74). The effects of the periplasmic loop are not easily attributed to a shorter sub-domain. Chimeras containing the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) from Eco-MscL and only the latter part of periplasmic loop region (aa 56-77) from Sa-MscL also show an increase in open dwell times, but not as dramatic as that observed in Figure 2C (in Fig. S1). Hence, the nonconserved periplasmic loop appears to act as a unit in its regulation of channel kinetics. While the region of the protein from aa 44-77 appears to play a vital role in defining the kinetics of the channel, any structure/function relationship of conductance and mechanosensitivity appears to be much more complicated. There is no obvious correlation between these periplasmic regions and channel conductance or mechanosensitivity. For example, using an accepted mechanosensitivity gage(Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998) where MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating threshold pressure for MscL (pL) divided by the threshold pressure of MscS (pS) is determined, we found the pL/pS ratio ranged from 0.85 to 2.5 with wild type Eco-MscL at 1.47 and Sa-MscL at 1.96, and the most sensitive chimera, SES56-77 (ratio 0.85), and one of the least sensitive, ESE44-77 (ratio 2.5), are in the same group shown in Figure 2A. For these chimeras we could find no correlation between either conductance or mechanosensitivity with the channel open dwell times. In summary, as shown in Figure 2C, the aa 44-49 region from Eco-MscL and the periplasmic loop from Sa-MscL confer long open dwell times, while aa 44-49 from Sa-MscL and periplasmic loop from Eco-MscL confer short open dwell times. Hence, the combination of Eco-MscL aa 44-49 and Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with extremely long openings, as shown in Figure 2C. A single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface has a pronounced effect on channel kinetics In contrast to the periplasmic loop, the periplasmic portion of TM1 is small and relatively conserved. Note that the SES44-49 chimera shown in Figure 2C, which has extremely long open dwell times, contains only 5 alternative residues relative to the wild type Sa-MscL channel (G46 is conserved). In order to determine if a specific site within the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) is responsible for controlling open dwell times, we generated site-directed mutations. As shown in Figure 3A, mutations of the Eco-MscL residues within this region were systematically changed back to the Sa-MscL sequence. Changing P44 back to L, PL44-45 to LI, L47 to K and L48 to I had no apparent effect on the aberrantly long channel openings. In contrast, mutation of I49 to F drastically reduced the channel open dwell time. A small, and as of yet unexplained change in conductance was noted: I49F was 3.48±0.04 nS, while the other mutants ranged from 3.80 to 4.05 nS; however, all were much larger than the conductance of Sa-MscL (2.5±0.2 nS), again suggesting that this is not a site of major regulation of channel conductance. On the other hand, the data indicate that residue 49, located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, is an important site for defining channel kinetics. Figure 3. Identification of a single residue important for open dwell time. Open in a new tab A. The Isoleucine at position 49 correlates with the long openings observed for the SES44-49 chimera. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in chimera SES44-49 to re-introduce S. aureus MscL residues, shown as gray dots; E. coli residues are marked as black dots. The traces were normalized to the scale bar in the upper right. “O” and “C” refer to open and closed. B. Exchanging I49 and F47 between E. coli and S. aureus MscL channels changes the channel open dwell time. Mutation of I49 to phenylalanine, a S. aureus MscL equivalent residue, in E. coli MscL generates a channel with short open dwell times. Substitution of F47 with isoleucine, an E. coli equivalent residue, in S. aureus MscL leads to a channel with long open dwell times. At top right of the traces, the scale bars are shown.If residue 49 indeed controls the open dwell time, then mutation of this residue within wild type Sa- and Eco-MscL backgrounds should also alter channel kinetics. We therefore exchanged the amino acids at this location. As shown in Figure 3B, mutation of Eco-MscL I49 to the residue of the comparable site of Sa-MscL, F, generates a channel with short open dwell times, similar to the Sa-MscL. Conversely, mutation of the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, to the Eco-MscL I leads to a channel with pronounced long open dwell times. Consistent with our findings that the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop defines long open dwell times, isoleucine at this site in the wild type Sa-MscL background leads to much longer channel openings than observed for the wild type Eco-MscL activity. Therefore, the Eco-MscL I49, and the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, is important in controlling the open dwell time of wild type MscL channels as well as chimeras. In sum, these data demonstrate that a single amino acid at the periplasmic end of TM1 can have dramatic effects on the stabilization of the open state of the channel. Additional mutational analysis of the single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface shows a correlation of the properties of residue substitutions with channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity In an attempt to determine the possible mechanisms for the role of this site in controlling channel openings, we mutated F47 in Sa- MscL into different amino acids. As shown in Figure 4A, Figure S2 and Table S1, mutations at this site led to channels with varying open dwell times that correlate with the hydrophobicity of the substitutions (r2=0.34, p=0.047). The hydrophobic amino acids I and L effected very long openings while those with charged side chains, K and E, led to shorter openings. However, all three aromatic amino acids anomalously led to very short openings. Figure 4. The effect of the hydrophobicity of Sa-47 substitutions on channel kinetics and mechansensitivity. Open in a new tab A. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with open dwell time. Kinetic analysis of the open dwell times was fitted to a three-open state model (see Materials and Methods). The longest time constants, τ3, expressed as the mean ± s.e.m, were plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. B. Hysteresis of Sa-F47L mutant. Representative traces show the delay of both opening and closing upon pressure application. The current and pressure recordings are shown in the upper and lower traces, respectively. Below the traces, the open probability (Po) of a typical experiment is plotted against pressure stimulation. Pressure was normalized to the threshold required to open MscS. Data for opening and closing were fit to Boltzmann equation, respectively, y = (ex)/(1 + ex), where x = (p − p1/2)/k, p is the applied pressure, p1/2 is the point at which the Po is 0.5, and k is the slope. Each pressure was held for 0.6 to 4s. Values for Po were obtained by current integration normalized to the total number of channels in the patch. At the highest pressure, the current remained relatively constant toward a maximum value, and no opening events were ever observed to exceed the value defined as Po = 1.0. C. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with mechanosensitivity. pL/pS ratio was plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. D. Linear regression analysis of open dwell time and mechanosensitivity. Open dwell time was plotted against the pL/pS ratio of each amino acid substitute.Among all the mutants that effect long open dwell times, F47L had an obvious hysteresis. As shown in Figure 4B, the channel showed a delay of several seconds in both opening and closing upon pressure changes. Boltzmann functions of open probability (Po) versus pressure were quite different for opening (P1/2 = 2.0 of pL/pS) and closing (P1/2 = 0.9 of pL/pS) when the duration of each pressure step is from 0.6 to 4s. The difference of the P1/2 for channel opening and closing was not apparent when slower pressure ramp (> 30s) was applied. Such hysteresis was also noted for the chimeras, SES44-49 and ESE50-77, discussed above, and appears to be an extreme exaggeration of a very mild hysteresis (less than a 10% change between opening and closing P1/2) of the wild type Eco-MscL reported previously (Kamaraju et al., 2010). All of the mutations at Sa-F47 caused a decrease in pL/pS ratio reflecting a more sensitive channel, as shown in Figure 4C and Figure S2. Moreover, the pL/pS ratio correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substitutions (r2=0.4, p=0.027), with hydrophobic amino acids effecting higher pL/pS ratios, and thus reflecting a channel that is less sensitive to membrane tension. In contrast with the kinetic data discussed above, and as shown in Figure 4A, the three “bulky” aromatic amino acids followed this correlation with mechanosensitivity well (Fig. 4C), suggesting a different mechanism underlying how the hydrophobicity of residue 47 affects channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity; in essence, the outliers for the correlation shown in Figure 4A are not seen in 4C. Consistent with this hypothesis, no correlation between open dwell time and pL/pS ratio of all mutations at F47 was observed (Fig. 4D). In summary, the above data confirm that the residue at this location plays a profound role in defining Sa-MscL open dwell times as well as mechanosensation; while hydrophobicity and “bulk” may help to define the channel kinetics, hydrophobicity alone plays the major role in determining mechanosensitivity. To test whether the equivalent site, I49, in Eco-MscL also plays an important role in channel function, we selectively mutated I49 to F, Y, and C. Surprisingly, we found that same mutations changed channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity with a similar trend as that observed for Sa-MscL (Fig. 5A and B and Fig. S3). These data suggest that this site has a conserved function among orthologues. Figure 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play a role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000; Blount et al., 1996b; Jeon and Voth, 2008; Maurer et al., 2000; Maurer and Dougherty, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified a single sub-domain or residue that acted as a variable spring element, in either a consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using a chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately, a single residue. We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/periplasmic lipid interface (44–49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with a stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times. The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that a single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows a severe hysteresis as well as delay in both opening and closing. These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by a mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. A recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces a kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on a clasp knife. Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest a common functional role for this site between orthologues. As a general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined a “hydrophobic lock”, at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is a major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007; Blount and Moe, 1999; Moe et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the “lock” is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found a residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur. Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of a role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms. In summary, by initially using a chimera approach, we identified a single amino acid serves as a “clasp knife spring” for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL.",

While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested E. coli and S aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure. Keywords: mechanosensitive channel, channel kinetics, osmoregulation, protein-lipid interactionsIntroduction The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a; Blount et al., 2007; Blount et al., 2008b; Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels from Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012; Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009; Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch. X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998; Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also see Fig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamers in vivo (Dorwart et al., 2010; Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family. Figure 1. The crystal structure of Tb-MscL and alignment of MscL homologs. Open in a new tab A: Crystal structure of Tb-MscL. a homopentamer with each subunit having two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by periplasmic loop (peri-loop) marked in blue, an N-terminal cytoplasmic helix (S1) connected to TM1, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical bundle connected to TM2 by a short cytoplasmic loop. The amino acid shown in red is G47 in Tb- MscL, which is equivalent to F47 in S. aureus and I49 in E. coli MscL. B. Sequence alignment of MscL homologs from E. coli (Eco-MscL) and S. aureus (Sa-MscL). Included in blue boxes are identical and similar residues in the E. coli and S. aureus MscL protein. The arrows and bold labels show the identified analogous amino acid in Eco- and Sa-MscL. The schematic illustration of MscL is also shown above the sequence alignment with S1, TM1, TM2 and c-terminal helix domains shown as boxes and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops shown as lines.Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005; Maurer et al., 2000; Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has a sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% with E. coli MscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that a site at the membrane interface plays such a crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment.Results The periplasmic region of the channel plays a major role in defining channel kinetics In an attempt to correlate channel kinetics with specific regions of the protein, numerous chimeras of the Eco- and Sa-MscL channel proteins were generated. Figure 1 shows the locations of different domains of the protein imposed upon the crystal structure of the Tb-MscL (panel a) as well as the sequence alignment of the Eco- and Sa-MscL proteins (panel b). The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as follows: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. As shown in Figure 2, recording the single channel openings of many Eco- and Sa-MscL chimeras revealed a pattern in channel open dwell time. Figure 2A shows chimeras with very short open dwell times, similar to wild type Sa-MscL. Chimeras in this panel share a common sequence in what is essentially the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface of the Sa-MscL, specifically amino acids (aa) 44-49. In contrast to chimeras shown in Figure 2A, channels shown in Figure 2B share a common sequence in the same region which, instead is from Eco-MscL. These chimeras also contain the periplasmic loop and beginning of TM2 from Eco-MscL, thus giving a total Eco-MscL domain of aa 44-77. This common sequence correlates with longer open dwell times, similar to the Eco-MscL activities. Figure 2. E. coli and S. aureus MscL chimeras reveal regions that strongly correlate with MscL channel open dwell time. Open in a new tab The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as following: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. Schematic illustration of each chimera is shown in the left with open boxes and black lines representing domains from E. coli MscL, while filled blue boxes and blue lines showing those from S. aureus MscL. Typical traces, with the appropriate scale bars, are shown at the right of each chimera. Specific areas of the protein that correlate with kinetics are boxed with red boxes highlighting the regions that correlate with long open dwell times and green boxes labeling the regions relevant to short channel kinetics. The chimeras have been grouped as discussed in text. Panel e shows a schematic summary showing the regions identified to be important in channel kinetics.The analyses of additional chimeras demonstrated that different subdomains of this entire periplasmic region, aa 44-77, effect different behaviors in channel kinetics. The most dramatic example is seen in Figure 2C, where we found that if a channel contains the TM1 periplasmic region of Eco-MscL, aa 44-49, as well as the periplasmic loop region from Sa-MscL, aa 50-77, a super-long open dwell time channel is produced, thus suggesting that both regions lead to stabilization of the open state; note that the time scale of the two chimeras in this panel is 86-fold and 140-fold of that for chimeras shown in panels a and b, respectively. This latter observation allows us to make some predictions. It first suggests that a combination of Sa-MscL “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL 44-49 and Eco-MscL aa 50-77 should yield a channel with “super-short” channel kinetics. While Figure 2A is consistent with this prediction, it cannot be rigorously tested; the equipment used cannot easily resolve channel openings below 1ms, which is approximately the longest opening for the Sa-MscL channel. However, it also predicts that a combination of the “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 44-49 with the “lengthening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 50-77 in an Eco-MscL background would lead to a channel with intermediate kinetics, perhaps not dissimilar to Eco-MscL. Indeed, as seen in Figure 2D, this prediction is upheld. Since aa 50-77 contains both the non-conserved periplasmic loop (aa 50-74) as well as the highly conserved beginning of TM2 (aa 75-77), the different effect of aa 50-77 from Sa- and Eco-MscL is very likely generated by differences in the periplasmic loop (aa 50-74). The effects of the periplasmic loop are not easily attributed to a shorter sub-domain. Chimeras containing the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) from Eco-MscL and only the latter part of periplasmic loop region (aa 56-77) from Sa-MscL also show an increase in open dwell times, but not as dramatic as that observed in Figure 2C (in Fig. S1). Hence, the nonconserved periplasmic loop appears to act as a unit in its regulation of channel kinetics. While the region of the protein from aa 44-77 appears to play a vital role in defining the kinetics of the channel, any structure/function relationship of conductance and mechanosensitivity appears to be much more complicated. There is no obvious correlation between these periplasmic regions and channel conductance or mechanosensitivity. For example, using an accepted mechanosensitivity gage(Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998) where MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating threshold pressure for MscL (pL) divided by the threshold pressure of MscS (pS) is determined, we found the pL/pS ratio ranged from 0.85 to 2.5 with wild type Eco-MscL at 1.47 and Sa-MscL at 1.96, and the most sensitive chimera, SES56-77 (ratio 0.85), and one of the least sensitive, ESE44-77 (ratio 2.5), are in the same group shown in Figure 2A. For these chimeras we could find no correlation between either conductance or mechanosensitivity with the channel open dwell times. In summary, as shown in Figure 2C, the aa 44-49 region from Eco-MscL and the periplasmic loop from Sa-MscL confer long open dwell times, while aa 44-49 from Sa-MscL and periplasmic loop from Eco-MscL confer short open dwell times. Hence, the combination of Eco-MscL aa 44-49 and Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with extremely long openings, as shown in Figure 2C.A single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface has a pronounced effect on channel kinetics In contrast to the periplasmic loop, the periplasmic portion of TM1 is small and relatively conserved. Note that the SES44-49 chimera shown in Figure 2C, which has extremely long open dwell times, contains only 5 alternative residues relative to the wild type Sa-MscL channel (G46 is conserved). In order to determine if a specific site within the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) is responsible for controlling open dwell times, we generated site-directed mutations. As shown in Figure 3A, mutations of the Eco-MscL residues within this region were systematically changed back to the Sa-MscL sequence. Changing P44 back to L, PL44-45 to LI, L47 to K and L48 to I had no apparent effect on the aberrantly long channel openings. In contrast, mutation of I49 to F drastically reduced the channel open dwell time. A small, and as of yet unexplained change in conductance was noted: I49F was 3.48±0.04 nS, while the other mutants ranged from 3.80 to 4.05 nS; however, all were much larger than the conductance of Sa-MscL (2.5±0.2 nS), again suggesting that this is not a site of major regulation of channel conductance. On the other hand, the data indicate that residue 49, located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, is an important site for defining channel kinetics. Figure 3. Identification of a single residue important for open dwell time. Open in a new tab A. The Isoleucine at position 49 correlates with the long openings observed for the SES44-49 chimera. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in chimera SES44-49 to re-introduce S. aureus MscL residues, shown as gray dots; E. coli residues are marked as black dots. The traces were normalized to the scale bar in the upper right. “O” and “C” refer to open and closed. B. Exchanging I49 and F47 between E. coli and S. aureus MscL channels changes the channel open dwell time. Mutation of I49 to phenylalanine, a S. aureus MscL equivalent residue, in E. coli MscL generates a channel with short open dwell times. Substitution of F47 with isoleucine, an E. coli equivalent residue, in S. aureus MscL leads to a channel with long open dwell times. At top right of the traces, the scale bars are shown.If residue 49 indeed controls the open dwell time, then mutation of this residue within wild type Sa- and Eco-MscL backgrounds should also alter channel kinetics. We therefore exchanged the amino acids at this location. As shown in Figure 3B, mutation of Eco-MscL I49 to the residue of the comparable site of Sa-MscL, F, generates a channel with short open dwell times, similar to the Sa-MscL. Conversely, mutation of the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, to the Eco-MscL I leads to a channel with pronounced long open dwell times. Consistent with our findings that the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop defines long open dwell times, isoleucine at this site in the wild type Sa-MscL background leads to much longer channel openings than observed for the wild type Eco-MscL activity. Therefore, the Eco-MscL I49, and the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, is important in controlling the open dwell time of wild type MscL channels as well as chimeras. In sum, these data demonstrate that a single amino acid at the periplasmic end of TM1 can have dramatic effects on the stabilization of the open state of the channel.Additional mutational analysis of the single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface shows a correlation of the properties of residue substitutions with channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity In an attempt to determine the possible mechanisms for the role of this site in controlling channel openings, we mutated F47 in Sa- MscL into different amino acids. As shown in Figure 4A, Figure S2 and Table S1, mutations at this site led to channels with varying open dwell times that correlate with the hydrophobicity of the substitutions (r2=0.34, p=0.047). The hydrophobic amino acids I and L effected very long openings while those with charged side chains, K and E, led to shorter openings. However, all three aromatic amino acids anomalously led to very short openings. Figure 4. The effect of the hydrophobicity of Sa-47 substitutions on channel kinetics and mechansensitivity. Open in a new tab A. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with open dwell time. Kinetic analysis of the open dwell times was fitted to a three-open state model (see Materials and Methods). The longest time constants, τ3, expressed as the mean ± s.e.m, were plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. B. Hysteresis of Sa-F47L mutant. Representative traces show the delay of both opening and closing upon pressure application. The current and pressure recordings are shown in the upper and lower traces, respectively. Below the traces, the open probability (Po) of a typical experiment is plotted against pressure stimulation. Pressure was normalized to the threshold required to open MscS. Data for opening and closing were fit to Boltzmann equation, respectively, y = (ex)/(1 + ex), where x = (p − p1/2)/k, p is the applied pressure, p1/2 is the point at which the Po is 0.5, and k is the slope. Each pressure was held for 0.6 to 4s. Values for Po were obtained by current integration normalized to the total number of channels in the patch. At the highest pressure, the current remained relatively constant toward a maximum value, and no opening events were ever observed to exceed the value defined as Po = 1.0. C. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with mechanosensitivity. pL/pS ratio was plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. D. Linear regression analysis of open dwell time and mechanosensitivity. Open dwell time was plotted against the pL/pS ratio of each amino acid substitute.Among all the mutants that effect long open dwell times, F47L had an obvious hysteresis. As shown in Figure 4B, the channel showed a delay of several seconds in both opening and closing upon pressure changes. Boltzmann functions of open probability (Po) versus pressure were quite different for opening (P1/2 = 2.0 of pL/pS) and closing (P1/2 = 0.9 of pL/pS) when the duration of each pressure step is from 0.6 to 4s. The difference of the P1/2 for channel opening and closing was not apparent when slower pressure ramp (> 30s) was applied. Such hysteresis was also noted for the chimeras, SES44-49 and ESE50-77, discussed above, and appears to be an extreme exaggeration of a very mild hysteresis (less than a 10% change between opening and closing P1/2) of the wild type Eco-MscL reported previously (Kamaraju et al., 2010). All of the mutations at Sa-F47 caused a decrease in pL/pS ratio reflecting a more sensitive channel, as shown in Figure 4C and Figure S2. Moreover, the pL/pS ratio correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substitutions (r2=0.4, p=0.027), with hydrophobic amino acids effecting higher pL/pS ratios, and thus reflecting a channel that is less sensitive to membrane tension. In contrast with the kinetic data discussed above, and as shown in Figure 4A, the three “bulky” aromatic amino acids followed this correlation with mechanosensitivity well (Fig. 4C), suggesting a different mechanism underlying how the hydrophobicity of residue 47 affects channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity; in essence, the outliers for the correlation shown in Figure 4A are not seen in 4C. Consistent with this hypothesis, no correlation between open dwell time and pL/pS ratio of all mutations at F47 was observed (Fig. 4D). In summary, the above data confirm that the residue at this location plays a profound role in defining Sa-MscL open dwell times as well as mechanosensation; while hydrophobicity and “bulk” may help to define the channel kinetics, hydrophobicity alone plays the major role in determining mechanosensitivity. To test whether the equivalent site, I49, in Eco-MscL also plays an important role in channel function, we selectively mutated I49 to F, Y, and C. Surprisingly, we found that same mutations changed channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity with a similar trend as that observed for Sa-MscL (Fig. 5A and B and Fig. S3). These data suggest that this site has a conserved function among orthologues. Figure 5.

The pL/pS ratio of both Eco-49 and Sa-47 substitutions are plotted against their Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic scores.Discussion While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play a role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000; Blount et al., 1996b; Jeon and Voth, 2008; Maurer et al., 2000; Maurer and Dougherty, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified a single sub-domain or residue that acted as a variable spring element, in either a consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using a chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately, a single residue. We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/periplasmic lipid interface (44–49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with a stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times. The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that a single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows a severe hysteresis as well as delay in both opening and closing. These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by a mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. A recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces a kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on a clasp knife. Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest a common functional role for this site between orthologues. As a general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined a “hydrophobic lock”, at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is a major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007; Blount and Moe, 1999; Moe et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the “lock” is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found a residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur. Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of a role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms. In summary, by initially using a chimera approach, we identified a single amino acid serves as a “clasp knife spring” for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL.Experimental Procedures Strains and cell growth All chimeras were generated using the PCR ligation method (Blount and Krause, 1993; Innis et al., 1990). All other site-directed mutants were generated using Mega primer method as described previously (Levin and Blount, 2004) and all were inserted in the pB10d expression construct (Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). The E. coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm) was used for electrophysiological experiments (Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). Cultures were grown routinely in Lennox broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburbh, PA, USA) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Anatrace inc., Maumee, OH, USA).Electrophysiology As described previously (Blount et al., 1999; Martinac et al., 1987), excised, inside-out patches from E. coli giant spheroplasts were examined at room temperature. Patch buffer contained 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 6.0. Data were acquired at −20 mV at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter, using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). For simplicity, the channel openings are shown upwards in the figures. A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments). For the kinetic experiments, the data were fit to a three open state model, as previously performed (Blount et al., 1996a; Blount et al., 1996b; Ou et al., 1998). The two longer time constants (τ2 and τ3) could be easily determined; the shortest is beyond the resolution of the equipment used. All kinetic data were obtained from at least 300 opening events per mutant from three independent experiments performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations. Mechanosensitivity was determined as previously described (Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). Briefly, MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating pressure for MscL divided by the threshold pressure of MscS is determined; here we will refer to this as the pL/pS ratio. All mechanosensitivity data were obtained from at least three independent recordings performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations.Supplementary Material 01 MS438457-supplement-01.pdf (798.7KB, pdf) MscL from E. coli and S. aureus are functionally distinct mechanosensitive channels MscL Chimeras allow correlation of structural differences with functional variance Residue hydropathy at one site influences gating and state-stabilization of MscL One residue can vary MscL activity similar to adjusting a spring of a clasp knife Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge all of the scientists and rotating students that, in the near and distant past, initiated aspects of chimera projects within our laboratory.

See the letter \"No evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade\" on page E3057. See \"Evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade\" in volume 112 on page 15976. Our report (1) describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in a tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were sequencing the Hypsibius dujardini genome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report (2–5). Bemm et al. (2) now report filtering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in a new, prefiltered genome assembly. Arakawa (3) has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 h, and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren (4) used a newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi'o (6), to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. (5) applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) (7) to our data and reported an independent genome assembly. Before discussing the robustness of our finding of extensive horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, we first note that we mistakenly uploaded an outdated version of our assembly to public databases. This assembly was 252 Mb, larger than the 212.3-Mb assembly that we had used in our report (1), as pointed out correctly by others (5). The 212.3-Mb assembly used in our report is available at the link provided below. The originally uploaded 252-Mb assembly includes ∼40 Mb of sequence that we had identified as microbial contamination (see methods detailed at https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response). This mistake may have contributed to discrepancies and issues raised by others. For example, Bemm et al. (2) identified 39 Mb of untrusted assembly, similar to the ∼40 Mb we filtered. Similarly, Delmont and Eren (4) identified whole bacterial genomes in our 252-Mb assembly, which were already largely filtered out in our 212.3-Mb assembly. We apologize to other groups for this mistake. A central finding of our original report (1) is a high rate of foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome, which has been argued by others (2–5) to be an artifact of incomplete filtering of contaminating microbial sequences. The availability of these other groups' independent assemblies and multiple filtering approaches [via k-mer selection (2) or GC% and coverage (5)] allows us to test the robustness of our conclusions. Because any metric used will have its own particular strengths and weaknesses, we used three different approaches: (i) employing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) index (8), (ii) identifying genes that align to prokaryotic but not eukaryotic sequences, and (iii) identifying a base level of HGT, i.e., “class C” genes as defined by Crisp et al. (9). Using the HGT index, we find that 3.8–7.1% of genes in these independent H. dujardini assemblies appear foreign (Fig. 1A). Examination of genes with prokaryotic but not eukaryotic alignments resulted in the identification of 164–384 genes (Fig. 1B). Class C genes in various H. dujardini assemblies range from 2.5% to 4.6% (Fig. 1C). For each of these metrics, the proportion and/or number of foreign genes found in H. dujardini is substantially elevated compared with typical animals (Fig. 1) (8–11). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Identification of foreign sequences in independent H. dujardini assemblies by different methods. (A) Foreign genes in independent H. dujardini genome assemblies were identified using the HGT index (8). The percent of all foreign genes in each dataset is shown. Tardigrade data are labeled in blue. Rotifer (animals with high levels of HGT) data are shown in brown. Data for other invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) are labeled in green. Rotifer, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster data were obtained from ref. 8. (B) Foreign genes were identified by selecting only those genes with BLAST hits to prokaryotes, but not eukaryotes (Evalue cutoff 1e-5). Note that this is a significantly more stringent approach for identifying foreign genes than the HGT index, and it excludes identification of prokaryotic genes with metazoan homologs, nonmetazoan eukaryotic genes, or metazoan genes that have been horizontally transferred. The raw number of all foreign genes in each dataset is shown. Tardigrade data are labeled in blue. Rotifer (animals with high levels of HGT) data are shown in brown. Data for other invertebrates (C. elegans and D. melanogaster) are labeled in green. Rotifer and C. elegans data were derived from ref. 8. D. melanogaster data were obtained by performing HGT index analysis (see methods at https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response) and the applying selection criteria detailed above. (C) Class C genes were identified in various datasets using the parameters detailed in ref. 9. Data for chordate and ecdysozoan animals were obtained from ref. 9, and the source of other datasets is noted parenthetically on the x axis. Plotted on the y axis is the percent of total genes that are classified as Class C foreign genes according to the methods used in ref. 9. Data for rotifer species are colored brown. Data from various tardigrade assemblies are colored blue. Data for other ecdysozoan animals (the group of animals to which tardigrades belong) are colored in green. Data for chordate animals are colored purple. The numbers above bars denote the percent of all genes classified as Class C foreign genes.In favor of these foreign genes not being contaminants is the fact that, in these independent assemblies, most genes identified as foreign reside on scaffolds together with tardigrade genes. Furthermore, foreign vs. tardigrade genes from these assemblies are represented at similar proportions in the other assemblies. On the whole, these independent assemblies show robust coverage of scaffolds from genomic and RNAseq reads of four independent sequencing efforts [including cleaned, antibiotic-treated individuals (3)] (Fig. 2). If these genes of foreign origin are considered to be contaminants and their scaffolds are removed, the completeness and size of each assembly is severely affected. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Foreign genes are contained in scaffolds confirmed by multiple datasets. 14 next-generation sequencing read datasets, originating from 4 independent sequencing projects, were mapped against (A) Bemm et al.’s (2) and (B) Koutsovoulos et al.’s (5) assembly and visualized using Anvi’o (6). Tracks showing coverage of Moleculo long-read (LR), Pacbio, and short-insert library reads [University of North Carolina (UNC) 300, 500, and 800] from our original study (1) are colored blue. Tracks showing coverage by genomic reads from ref. 5 are colored purple. Tracks showing coverage by genomic and pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Kazuharu Arakawa are colored green. The track showing coverage by pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Itai Yanai is colored yellow. Black tick marks in the outer rings indicate scaffolds that contain foreign sequences identified using the method indicated in parentheses. Highlighted in red are scaffolds that are covered by genomic reads originating from only one group’s sequencing effort. Highlighted in orange are scaffolds covered by two of three groups’ genomic reads.Together, these data suggest that H. dujardini is likely to have an elevated level of foreign genes, most likely acquired by HGT rather than being artifacts of remaining contaminants. The level of HGT that we infer remains higher than in most animals that have been tested (Fig. 1), although not as high a level as we had originally concluded (1). It has been suggested that many foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome might not be functional or might be contaminants because RNAseq reads do not map to some of these genes (3, 5). However, it is well documented in the literature that many HGT genes are expressed at low levels or, in some cases, are not expressed at all. For example, it is known that essentially the entire Wolbachia genome has been transferred into the genome of Drosophila ananassae, yet only ∼2% (28/1,206) of these horizontally acquired genes are transcribed at detectable levels (12). Follow-up investigations confirmed extensive HGT into the nuclear genome of this Drosophila species but failed to detect biologically relevant expression of any foreign genes (13, 14). Thus, although identification of an expressed foreign gene could be viewed as evidence in favor of HGT, lack of expression alone is not a criterion for disproving HGT. We speculated that HGT might be important for tardigrade biology, but we restricted our analysis to HGT rather than functional HGT (1). The RNAseq datasets (3, 5) will aid in assessing potential functions of these genes. We acknowledge that different groups have concluded different proportions of HGT in the H. dujardini genome and that different metrics will give different estimates for the proportion of foreign genes in the genome. We have our own concerns about some of the methods used by other groups to exclude genes from our assembly (see https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response), but we appreciate that the work of multiple groups is moving the science forward rapidly. All genomes are iterations, and we fully expect that new data and new technologies will refine this genome much as they have for the human genome and others. The true proportion of HGT may well lie between the various current estimates and may best be resolved with new sequencing technologies and bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches.
