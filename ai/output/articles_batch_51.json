    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction As a species, we have been working and living in space for more than 60 years, with continuous occupation for the last 23 years via the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. During this time, we have discovered that spaceflight induces numerous physiologic alterations, including but not limited to muscle and bone loss, structural changes in the eyes and brain, altered cardiovascular function, and altered cognitive function [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In some cases, we have developed effective countermeasures for these undesirable outcomes, but in other cases, understanding and countering the causes of these outcomes remain active areas of investigation. For example, adequate exercise and nutrition are sufficient to limit bone and muscle loss in astronauts onboard the ISS [10]. In contrast, causes of and countermeasures for alterations in the brain remain active areas of research [11]. As research advances, it has become increasingly clear that there are some molecular hallmarks of spaceflight [12], which include mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and epigenetic changes. Current challenges of space life sciences research include linking these molecular alterations to the physiologic ones as well as to the known spaceflight hazards. These hazards include distance from Earth, confinement, being in a hostile and closed environment, altered gravity, and increased and altered radiation exposure [12,13,14]. With our increased presence in space, our ability to conduct space medicine continues to improve. For example, we now understand that improved skin care is needed in flight due to the frequency of skin rashes [15]. Currently, there is an increased interest in personalized approaches for optimizing astronaut health [16,17,18,19,20]. For example, exercise and nutrition can be individually tailored to prevent muscle loss in flight [10,21]. The success of these approaches on Earth, combined with the increased use of -omics data in terrestrial medicine, has also led to using -omics approaches in astronauts [17,21,22,23]. While still in its infancy [24,25,26], it seems clear that combining -omics data from space-flown model organisms, such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and rodents, with astronaut data can accelerate the discovery process, in part by compensating for the current rarity of human space -omics datasets [22,27]. For example, C. elegans, rodents, and humans all display alterations in insulin-linked gene expression in response to spaceflight [28]. Given the central role of insulin in human health and longevity on Earth [29], it is highly likely this system is equally important to maintain in space. Indeed, recent data from space-flown rodents confirm that the liver–muscle axis is central to regulating both global metabolic health and muscle health functions the same in space as on Earth and that its perturbation may contribute to both liver and muscle pathology in flight [30]. While our advances in fundamental space life sciences and space medicine have been substantial, these are largely limited to habitation in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With planned government and commercial missions beyond LEO (BLEO), understanding fundamental changes to biological systems and countermeasures to detrimental alterations at new destinations, such as the Moon and Mars, are emerging challenges [31]. For example, current exercise countermeasures for maintaining muscle on the ISS are not feasible on currently planned spacecraft due to size constraints [32]. Similarly, storing adequate nutrition further away from Earth is operationally challenging [33,34,35]. Thus, despite not being a current priority for research on the ISS, understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy in space remains important for these new exploration class missions. Currently, designing space biology experiments for BLEO means that the experiments must be small and autonomous [36,37,38]. For example, using a CubeSat, such as Biosentinel [39], as a passive or mostly passive payload on Artemis [40], or an autonomous instrument on a Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission [41]. Thus, using standard flight genomic model organisms [27] that are small, such as bacteria, yeast, C. elegans, or Drosophila, is feasible. In terms of muscle strength, a microfluidic device has been developed for assessing strength in C. elegans [42], and this has been successfully used to both demonstrate decreased strength in mutants with defective muscle structure [43,44,45] and to identify drugs to improve strength both in muscle mutants [46] and with age [47]. Thus, the use of C. elegans for studying and countering muscle strength decline on the Moon is technically feasible, albeit challenging. The use of C. elegans in space biology has recently been reviewed [48,49,50]. Notably, past studies have demonstrated conserved gene expression changes in response to spaceflight between C. elegans, rodents, and humans. These include declines in muscle contractile genes [51], mitochondrial genes [12,52], and insulin signaling [28,53]. The knockdown of these genes on Earth is sufficient to induce strength decline [45,46]. Therefore, we hypothesized that worms would be weaker in space and aimed to directly test this on the micro-16 ISS payload, flown starting in February 2021 (NG-15 launch). The results from our experiment pave the way for testing pharmaceutical and nutrient countermeasures for strength decline in spaceflown C. elegans, as well as for testing C. elegans muscle strength at various BLEO destinations.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Worm Preparation Wild-type (wt) Bristol isolate (N2 [54]) and dystrophin (dys-1) mutant (BZ33 [55]) worms were maintained in C. elegans Maintenance Medium (CeMM) [56], purchased on contract from Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK. Cultures were established as previously described [49] and maintained at two separate sites (Texas Tech University, USA and University of Nottingham, UK). Ten days before the launch, approximately 1000 larvae from a stock culture were transferred into a Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bag (Saint Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, Solon, OH, USA) containing 20 mL CeMM at Texas Tech University (TTU). These primary culture bags and CeMM-Filled FEP bags were shipped to the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), Norfolk, on 10th February 2021. The culture bags were shipped with phase change material [57] at a temperature of 16 ± 2 °C. Upon arrival (following a lengthy delay of shipment in transit due to poor weather), culture bags were inspected for contamination and stored in the incubator at 22 °C for 2 days (flight bags) and 4 days (ground bags). The flight bags were handed over to NASA cold stowage on 17th February 2021 at a temperature of 15 ± 1 °C for the 20th February 2021 NG-15 launch. Ground control bags were sent to TTU, and the temperature profile of flight bags was replicated on a time delay of two days (Figure 1). Upon arrival at the ISS, the culture bags were incubated at 20 °C, and the CeMM bags were stored at 4 °C. Cultures were incubated for a week in microgravity before initiating the multigenerational culturing outlined in [49]. Briefly, 1 mL of culture was transferred to a fresh FEP bag containing CeMM every 2 weeks. All experiments used a starting mixed population of well-fed animals, with force measurements only being made on gravid adults. Upon experiment completion, ground bags at TTU were frozen and stored at −80 °C, while flight bags were frozen in the ISS MELFI at −80 °C until download to Earth via NASA cold stowage at −20 °C, followed by dry ice transport to TTU for storage at −80 °C. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Detailed temperature profile of the culture bags during shipping from TTU to EVMS and Launch. Bags were stored at 20 °C after receiving them at ISS and TTU Lab. 2.2. Fabrication and Assembly of a Microfluidic Device in Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA) Devices were fabricated and assembled in WLA as previously described [42,49]. The micropillar-based NemaFlex-S device was fabricated using a modified two-step soft lithography process [58]. The mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 4″ silicon wafer as a substrate. First, a 20 μm tall photoresist layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the NemaFlex chamber. Next, a second layer of 80 μm height was fabricated on top of the initial layer. The second layer was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provided chambers with a depth of approximately 100 μm containing deformable pillars of 80 μm height. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices of 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thickness were cast using Sylgard 184 part A (base) and part B (curing agent) 10:1 by weight (Dow Corning) over the SU-8 mold by curing for approximately 2 h at 70 ± 1 °C. Inlet, outlet, and air vent holes were cored with a 1 mm hole puncher (Acuderm, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA). The devices were thoroughly cleaned with Scotch tape to remove dirt before bonding. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY, USA) for 90s and bonded to a 2 × 3 inch glass slide. Bonding was done, ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. The bonded devices were immediately placed in an oven for 10 min at 70 ± 1 °C. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min to prevent any bacterial build-up and reduce bubble formation during worm loading. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing the devices with DI water. The treated devices were soaked in DI water overnight at 20 ± 1 °C to release any air bubbles from the devices. Fabrication of devices took place at TTU, with devices shipped to EVMS. The microfluidic chips were shipped in Ziploc bags with DI water. Fabrication of WLA took place at BioServe Space Technologies, with WLA shipped to EVMS. Assembly took place at EVMS and was conducted by BioServe Space Technologies (Boulder, CO, USA). 2.3. Image Acquisition and Processing The worms were loaded into NemaFlex-S chambers using a previously described procedure [49]. Briefly, a five-step process involving a syringe pump and NemaFlex-S device priming was used to transfer worms from FEP culture bags into the NemaFlex-S device for imaging in a semi-automated fashion. For on-orbit loading, an additional manual centrifugation of worms toward the loading port of the FEP bags was achieved by having the crew member swing the bag in a circular motion with the injection port pointed away from the crew member. Additionally, loading volumes on orbit were calibrated based upon the results of a training time point prior to the experimental time point and based upon crew member impressions of culture density for the experimental time point vs. the training time point. Once loaded, worms were allowed to habituate to the micropillar arena for approximately 10 min before imaging. One-minute-long videos of crawling worms were acquired with a Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse TS 100) at 4× magnification with a camera resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels recorded at 5 frames per second. All videos were recorded at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C. The recorded movies were processed offline using custom routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2018b) for the quantification of pillar displacements as previously published [42]. Recorded videos were analyzed manually using ImageJ (version 1.48 [59]) for measuring worm diameters at the mid-section and body length at the centerline of the worm. Videos were processed manually for quantification of coiling phenotyping. Adult worms were identified based on their body size and the presence of eggs. 2.4. RNA Extraction, Sequencing and Data Pre-Processing RNA was extracted from frozen worm samples using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research cat# R2050). Two to three independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment. RNA concentration was determined using Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and next-generation sequencing were subsequently performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Hong Kong), with strand-specific (second strand cDNA synthesis with dUTP) 100 bp paired-end reads generated using the DNBseq platform. Cleaned reads (reads with adaptor sequences, contamination, and low-quality reads removed via the SOAPnuke software version 2.1.8 developed by BGI [60]) obtained from BGI were deemed to be of good quality (no over-represented sequences or adapter sequences, and median per base quality scores always >30, as determined using FastQC; Babraham Bioinformatics) and transcript-level abundances consequently estimated via pseudo-alignment to the C. elegans reference transcriptome (Ensembl release 108) using Kallisto (version 0.48.0 [61]). Gene counts were then inferred via the tximport R package (version 1.28.0 [62]), and lowly expressed genes were filtered out (genes with a count <10 in every sample) to leave 13,897 genes for downstream analyses. 2.5. Gene Expression Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed via DESeq2 (version 1.40.2 [63]) in R (version 4.3.1). Beforehand, principal component analysis (PCA) of the top 500 most variable genes (with variance stabilizing transformed counts used as input) was undertaken for unsupervised clustering of samples. Wald tests were then used to test for differential gene expression, with pairwise comparisons made between flight and ground samples per strain, as well as between the ground samples of each strain and between the flight samples of each strain. Log fold-change shrinkage was performed using an adaptive shrinkage method (ashr) [64], and the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust p values to control for false discovery rate (FDR) [65]. Significant gene expression changes in each case were defined at the adjusted p < 0.05 level. Functional characteristics of differentially expressed gene lists were elucidated by undertaking over-representation analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the clusterProfiler R package [66]. In this case, each GO sub-category (biological process, cellular component, molecular function) was considered, with the corresponding background gene list being the genes input into differential expression testing. Enriched GO terms were defined as those with a Benjamini Hochberg corrected p < 0.05 [65]. Mapping of our gene expression data to established gene co-expression modules was conducted using the genemodules tool for C. elegans [67]. Briefly, this software applied an independent component analysis approach on a large collection of C. elegans microarray studies to identify clusters of genes with related gene expression patterns and then annotated these clusters based on their predicted molecular roles and functions. Tool 1 was used per pairwise comparison with log2 fold-change values of all genes subject to differential expression testing (i.e., the 13,897 genes that survived pre-filtering) as input in each case to determine the directional activity of the 209 defined transcriptional modules. Module descriptions potentially relevant to spaceflight and putative transcriptional regulators were subjectively assigned from Supplemental Table S2 (from [67]) and Tool 3. For drug target prediction, differentially expressed genes were first mapped to human orthologs using OrthoList2 [68] with one-to-many mapping. Following this, the QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-01) Upstream Regulator Analysis tool [69] was used on the human orthologs of significant differential expressed genes (adjusted p < 0.05), with the human orthologs for all genes used as input into differential expression testing serving as the reference/background set. Targets were considered inhibited if the activation Z-score was <−2 and activated if the activation Z-score was >2 [69]. Additionally, targets were only deemed significant if the Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected p value was <0.05 [65].",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Growth Observation of ground control worms indicated that worm growth was as expected based upon results from the experiment verification test [49]. The crew assessed flight growth by eye based on perceived density (e.g., small or medium) of worms within FEP bags. Growth was adequate for the ability to load worms into NemaFlex-S devices as indicated by loading of 37 wt including 15 adults and 25 dys-1, including 13 adults on the crew’s training time point session. For the experimental time point, 41 wt including 30 adults and 49 dys-1 including 29 adults were loaded into the devices. For comparison, ground cultures for the experimental time point were 45 wt including 30 adults and 36 dys-1 including 25 adults loaded into the devices. These data suggest no major differences in development/reproduction in flight, consistent with past C. elegans flight data [70,71,72,73,74,75]. 3.2. Body Diameter and Length Force estimation using NemaFlex devices is dependent on adjustment for body diameter [42]. Therefore, the body diameter and length of both wt and dys-1 adult worms were measured from the recorded movies. The diameter of both strains cultured on ISS was significantly lower than both strains cultured on Earth (Figure 2a, Table 1). The body diameter of wt worms was 5.5% less, and in dys-1 worms, it was 7.9% less. The smaller diameter might be due to altered metabolism, as this has previously been reported for spaceflown C. elegans [52]. Indeed, our gene expression data are consistent with previously reported gene expression data for spaceflown C. elegans [48,51,52,53,76,77]. The length of both strains was not significantly different in flight than on the ground. Note that this contrasts with a previous flight where length decreased significantly by 5.5% [52]. This discrepancy could be because we used mixed populations of worms, whereas [52,78] used age-synchronized worms, or because we are using a different diet, which is known to profoundly impact C. elegans morphology and life history [79]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on body diameter and length of wt and dys-1 worms. (A) body diameter (B) body length. The diameters of both the strains grown at ISS are significantly different compared to ground controls, whereas there is no difference in the length of the worms. Sample size: n = 30 for wt ground and flight, n = 25 for dys-1 ground, and n = 29 for dys-1 flight. All the data pass the normality test. We used two-way ANOVA (Tukey multiple testing) for calculating significant differences; p < 0.001 is for ****.Table 1. The effect of space flight on body diameter, length, and muscle strength for adult wt and dys-1 worms. Strain Ground Flight Sample Size Diameter (µm) Length (µm) f95 (µN) Sample Size Diameter (µm) Length (µm) f95 (µN) wt 30 46.97 ± 1.92 1077 ± 60 22.34 ± 5.67 30 44.35 ± 1.88 1062 ± 42 18.62 ± 4.05 dys-1 25 48.24 ± 1.87 1110 ± 43 21.38 ± 5.39 29 44.41 ± 2.29 1080 ± 45 14.23 ± 3.87 Open in a new tab 3.3. Muscle Strength Strength was measured in the second generation in flight to reflect strength in worms wholly developed onboard ISS and with in-flight loading methods and video quality that had been tested on first generation from Earth prior to use with the experimental time point. To measure adult worms’ muscle strength, a 60-s-long video of crawling worms in NemaFlex-S chambers was recorded. The recorded videos were analyzed, and we identified the pillar with the maximal deflection in each image and generated a cumulative probability distribution with all the maximal deflections, as previously described [42]. We use the 95th percentile of this maximal force distribution, referred to as f95, as a measure of muscle strength. As shown in Figure 3, on Earth, gravid adult dys-1 worms are not significantly weaker than wt. This is consistent with previous reports where dys-1 mutants only display strength deficits vs. wt post day 1 of adulthood [44]. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on muscle strength of wt and dys-1 worms. There is no difference in muscle strength between the strains on the ground. The muscle strength of space-grown worms decreased by 16.6% and 33.4% for wt and dys-1, respectively. Sample size: n = 30 for wt ground and flight both, n = 25 for dys-1 ground, and n = 29 for dys-1 flight. All the data passed the normality test. We used two-way ANOVA (Tukey multiple testing) for calculating significant differences, * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and **** for p < 0.001.The muscle strength of the wt worms cultured onboard the ISS was significantly lower than on Earth (ground: f95 = 22.34 ± 5.67, flight f95 = 18.62 ± 4.05, n = 30 per group, p ≤ 0.05; Figure 3). Notably, the strength deficit (16%) was roughly similar to what is observed in astronauts’ muscles (6–14% [80]) and similar to the previously published quantitative changes in muscle contractile protein during flight (7–10% [51]). In flight, dys-1 mutants were also weaker than on Earth (ground: f95 = 21.38 ± 5.39, n = 25; flight f95= 14.23 ± 3.87, n = 29, p ≤ 0.001; Figure 3). It should be noted that the decrease in body diameter of both strains is similar in flight (see Figure 2 and Table 1), indicating the strength decrement is not due to the differences in the measurement technique. The strength in the dys-1 mutants was 23% less than wt worms onboard the ISS. This may reflect our small sample size or a difference in the response to spaceflight in dys-1 mutants vs. wild-type, as previously reported [81]. It could be that the altered neuromuscular health of dys-1 worms predisposes them to the negative effects of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system. 3.4. Gene Expression Analysis Past gene expression analysis of spaceflown C. elegans has revealed decreased expression of muscle cytoskeletal genes and mitochondrial genes [48,51,52,77,82]. We have previously shown that mutation of some of these muscle genes results in decreased strength [45] and that declines in mitochondrial function also result in decreased strength [46,47], both in C. elegans on Earth. Therefore, to confirm that decreased expression of cytoskeletal genes or mitochondrial genes could be contributing to strength decline in flight, we measured gene expression in the same cultures of worms that we measured strength in, as well as two additional cultures. Unlike most past flights of C. elegans [48], we employed an unbiased approach to the analysis of gene expression (e.g., we did not focus solely on specific subsets of genes). As shown in Figure 4A, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the most variable genes showed a distinct clustering of samples in line with their experimental conditions. The tight clustering of samples within conditions indicates that the cultures without strength measures have similar gene expression profiles to the cultures from which strength measures were obtained. The first principal component (PC1), which accounted for 72.9% of the variance, separated the samples based on environment (i.e., flight vs. ground control). Meanwhile, the second principal component (PC2) differentiated the samples based on genetic background, distinguishing between wt and dys-1 mutant and explaining 13.5% of the variance. These results suggest that spaceflight is the main driver of the bulk of gene expression changes, while the dys-1 mutation has a lesser but significant effect. This is consistent with a past report demonstrating that dys-1 mutation has an impact on the transcriptional response to spaceflight [81]. The outlier genes driving the variation in the PCA are shown in Figure 4B. The descriptions of these genes match the descriptions of the clusters of genes identified in our module analysis below. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Global trends in spaceflight gene expression. (A) PCA clustering of samples based on top 500 most variable genes, (B) PCA loadings of top 500 most variable genes, (C) Volcano plots for wt flight vs. wt ground and dys-1 flight vs. dys-1 ground differential expression analyses. Annotated genes in each case are those ranked in the top 20 upregulated/downregulated based on log2 fold-change.In terms of Differential Expressed Genes (DEGs) with spaceflight, the distribution of expression changes is largely similar between the two strains, as shown in Figure 4C. While it is tempting to examine individual DEGs as meaningful, biological systems are complex, and genes do not act in isolation [83,84]. Therefore, we provide the full set of DEGs (Table S1) but limit discussion of changes to sets of genes with changing expression rather than individual genes. In terms of the genome level scale of changes with spaceflight (e.g., each strain’s flight response normalized against each strain’s ground control), 4726 genes displayed significant changes in expression in response to spaceflight, with 409 uniquely up in wt, 394 uniquely down in wt, 1069 uniquely up in dys-1, 765 uniquely down in dys-1, and 1295 up in both strains and 819 down in both strains (Figure 5A). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Overlay of wt and dys-1 transcriptome responses to spaceflight. (A) Overlay of genes upregulated by spaceflight in wt and/or dys-1 worms. Venn diagram illustrates the degree of commonality/uniqueness in spaceflight-upregulated genes between the two strains, while the heatmap depicts representative Gene Ontology (GO) terms for common/uniquely upregulated genes up in flight. Venn shows the commonality and differential changes in wt vs. dys-1. The able displays common and differential GO expression in wt vs. dys-1 (B) As per panel A but for genes downregulated by spaceflight.As shown in Figure 5B, gene ontology analysis of DEGs reveals changes in innate immune response as up in both strains, stress response as up in both strains and metabolism and cytoskeleton as down in both. These changes are broadly similar to past analyses of space-flown C. elegans where the stress response is up and metabolic and cytoskeletal genes are down [48,51,52,53,77]. These gene expression changes could underlie the strength decline in flight as strength goes down in both strains. These gene expression changes could also potentially underlie the decrease in muscle size that has previously [85] and recently been reported for other spaceflown C. elegans [86]. Changes not likely to underlie strength decline in both strains in flight include upregulation of protein synthesis in dys-1 in flight and decreased neural development/function in dys-1 in flight. C. elegans was the first multicellular animal for which a transcriptional co-regulation map was generated [87]. This map has recently been updated [67], employing advances in both DEG identification and analysis [88,89,90,91,92]. When wt and dys-1 DEGs are analyzed for the effect of spaceflight vs. ground controls, three modules are inhibited in response to space flight, and four modules are activated in both wt and dys-1 (Figure 6A). Only one module is uniquely activated in wt, whereas three are uniquely activated in dys-1 (Figure 6A). These observations are consistent with spaceflight being the major driver of gene expression changes (Figure 4A). The modules inhibited in both include identifications (Figure 6B) consistent with past spaceflight experiments [48]. Module 65 was previously [67] specifically identified as responsive to spaceflight and other environmental conditions and may be controlled by the transcription factor DAF-16 [93], amongst others, where DAF-16 has been suggested to be a controller of C. elegans response to spaceflight [52,53,77,94]. Module 169 is a HIF-1 [95] responsive module [67] and is associated with mitochondrial function. This is consistent with both past C. elegans gene expression changes and the recent observation that decreased mitochondrial gene expression is a fundamental feature of biological alterations in response to spaceflight [96]. Notably, this module may also be regulated [67] by SKN-1 [97], which has also previously been suggested to be a transcription factor regulating the response to spaceflight [53]. Module 185 is associated with calcium handling in neurons and may be regulated [67] by UNC-89 [98] and DAF-19 [99]. This module is particularly interesting following recent observations that neuronal morphology [100] and neurotransmitter production [76] are altered in C. elegans in flight. Similarly, altered calcium handling in aging C. elegans muscle has recently been shown to negatively impact mitochondrial health [101] and, therefore, might be an alternative mechanism by which mitochondrial gene expression declines in response to spaceflight. In terms of commonly activated modules, modules 47 and 118 are both responsive to mitochondrial stress [67], which is consistent with modules 65 and 169 being inhibited. Potential transcriptional regulators of these modules are displayed in (Figure 6C). Module 61 is associated with response to inhibited Acetylcholinesterase [67], which is consistent with Acetylcholinesterase gene expression being decreased in response to spaceflight in C. elegans [53]. Module 151 is associated with desmosomal cell adhesion and calcium metabolism in the hypodermis [67]. This result contrasts decreased cell adhesion in C. elegans [51,52] and human muscle [102] in response to spaceflight. It could be that this response is unique to C. elegans as they have a hydrostatic skeleton that would be predicted to be altered by spaceflight. It could be related to alterations in global calcium homeostasis in C. elegans and the potential regulation of mitochondria via both calcium and cadherins in C. elegans [47,101], or it could be an over compensation of adhesome structures as a response to failure as recently suggested for aging human muscle [103]. As with the DEG GO analysis, the module analysis identifies decreased expression of mitochondrial metabolism genes and increased expression of mitochondrial/other stress response genes as a potential cause of the decreased strength in flight. Unlike the DEG GO analysis, the module analysis also suggests decreased neuronal function and specifically altered acetylcholine signal from nerve to muscle (and consequent post-synaptic remodeling of excitation–contraction coupling) as another potential contributor to strength decline in flight. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cluster analysis to identify coexpressed gene modules. (A) Activity of gene co-expression modules in flight vs. ground control comparison. (B) Activity of gene co-expression modules in dys-1 vs. wt comparisons. (C) Table of module annotations and summarized activation between pairwise comparisons.Consistent with the past report that dys-1 modulates the DEG in response to spaceflight [81], our DEG (Figure 5) and module analysis (Figure 6) confirm dys-1 modulates the DEG response to spaceflight. As shown in Figure 6A, module 77 is uniquely activated in wt and is responsive to mitochondrial stress [67]. Interestingly, module 77 is significantly activated in dys-1 vs. wt on the ground (Figure 6B), potentially explaining the lack of further significant activation in dys-1 in flight. Activation of this module at baseline is not surprising given the impact of dys-1 on mitochondrial function [44,46,104] and gene expression [105]. Consistent with a baseline mitochondria stress response in dys-1, the modules uniquely activated in dys-1 in response to flight include a stress-responsive module (29) [106] that includes the dystrophin-associated protein Dystrobrevin, a neuromuscular function module (18), and a protein translation in muscle module (93) (Figure 6). The activation of these modules suggests that the baseline neuromuscular dysfunction in dys-1 is exacerbated by the added negative effect(s) of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system. Interestingly, three modules that are inhibited at baseline in dys-1 do not alter in response to spaceflight (Figure 6B,C). These are module 6, metabolic response to starvation, module 86, response to mitochondrial stress, and module 149, response to iron stress, pH, and starvation [67]. This, again, suggests that the baseline neuromuscular dysfunction in dys-1 is exacerbated by the added negative effect(s) of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system. This may explain why dys-1 are significantly weaker in flight than wt (small sample size being the other obvious reason). 3.5. Genes Predicted to Be Altered in Space Are Predicted to Be Altered by Drugs on Earth With the increased interest in precision medicine in space, the commercialization of space, and the rise of synthetic biology [107,108,109], astropharmacy has recently emerged as a recognized field of specialization [110,111]. The goals of astropharmacy mirror those of pharmacy on Earth but with a specific focus on medication storage [112,113,114,115], access [114,115], use, and manufacturing beyond Earth [111,116]. Current challenges include understanding how detrimental physiological changes in flight might be countered by existing medications, how medications may work differently in flight, and how to ensure our explorers receive the best possible outcome while minimizing side effects despite limited resources. Having found a number of gene expression changes that were conserved with past missions [48,51,52,53,76,77] and profiles indicative of pathways that medications target (e.g., mitochondria, metabolism, neurotransmitters), we were curious if drugs might be predicted to act differently in flight. Therefore, we explored the potential of using drug target predictions to identify compounds that might work better or worse in flight based upon spaceflight-induced gene expression changes. As shown in Figure 7, QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identifies 31 drugs as being regulators of genes whose expression is either increased or decreased in flight. These results suggest, unsurprisingly, that pharmacological activity is likely to be affected, resulting in alterations of medication’s efficacy and safety profile in flight, based upon underlying alterations in gene expression due to not only physiological changes in spaceflight but also further exacerbation by alterations in gene expressions due to medications, such as on the list. Potential consequences include the need for dose adjustments, changes to classic first-line treatment options, and ultimately, for drug selection to be optimized through pharmacogenomics and/or modeling. Clearly, this is an important area of future research as we begin to live and work on other celestial bodies with a more diverse population with different comorbidities needing a better understanding of astropharmacy.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Historically, space biology experiments have been constrained by mass, power, size, and crew time limitations [117]. Now, with a functional ISS, there is functional laboratory equipment, such as the microscope we employed in this study, and crew time for carrying out complex tasks, such as our experiment or extracting and sequencing DNA on ISS [118]. With these improved abilities to conduct science, we were able to extend past studies using C. elegans in space to include capture not only of transcriptomic data [48] but to study physiology more comprehensively than simple movement analysis [49]. Using our NemaFlex-S, we were successfully able to measure worm strength both in flight and on the ground. Using these extended capabilities, we were able to test and confirm the hypothesis that worms, like people [119], are weaker in space. This demonstration extends our understanding of muscle response to spaceflight by demonstrating that not only are the molecular changes in muscle sarcomeric gene expression driven by altered MyoD expression conserved between worms and people [51], but so too are the functional consequences. These technical advances and increased knowledge may now be combined to test various nutrient and pharmaceutical interventions to improve muscle strength in flight, as we have recently been able to do for DMD and aging muscle on Earth [46,47]. This experiment presents an example of how near-simultaneous in-flight collection of -omics alongside phenotypic measures can enable insights into the potential molecular mechanisms behind spaceflight-associated physiological deconditioning [120]. Response of gene expression to spaceflight has gained increased interest in the past few years, principally due to the implementation of NASA’s GeneLab program [121]. This has even resulted in introducing network biology into scientific roadmaps, for example ESA’s Biology roadmap 9E [122]. At the simplest level, DEG analysis focuses on individual genes, while this may be useful, it ignores the power of big data, such as reproducibility [123] across experiments and systems and may be biased based upon differences in computational approach/pipeline [124]. For example, the gene identified as most downregulated in this study was previously identified as one of the most upregulated in the first unbiased whole genome response of C. elegans to flight [77]. This difference could also be due to operational differences in the two missions. In contrast, our use of GO and network/module analysis has, once again [48], revealed a consistent and reproducible change in gene expression in C. elegans in response to spaceflight. A key finding of this study is that strength decreases in flight. As discussed above, declines in mitochondrial gene expression are repeatedly observed in response to spaceflight [48] and are a treatable cause of strength decline on Earth [46,47]. Therefore, testing of mitochondrial interventions to reverse strength decline in space is now required to determine if the correlation between strength and mitochondrial decline is causal or not. Additionally, as our gene annotation and computational skills improve, it is possible to obtain more knowledge from gene expression data than in the past. For example, our module analysis reveals that certain gene expression changes can be attributed to specific tissues (for example, cell adhesion in the hypodermis), whereas others are more universal (for example, mitochondrial stress). Further, our new analysis reveals that calcium metabolism in neurons is also a potential cause of strength decline in space, more specifically by altering acetylcholine signaling, again suggesting an interventional study is required to (dis)prove the casualty of this link. This suggestion, unsurprisingly, has also previously been made for human strength decline in flight [125,126]. As we confront the new age of commercial spaceflight, it remains unclear how experiments such as ours will be possible on as yet unbuilt commercial space stations. The largest space agencies (the Japanese Space Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not announced any plans for funding scientists to conduct research on such platforms. Given that the US National Lab program relies on scientists to provide their own funding, it seems current US policy may continue, and there will be no funding for academic research on commercial space stations provided by the US government. Clearly, this is an opportunity for smaller agencies, such as the United Kingdom, the Australian, the Italian, and the United Arab Emirates Space Agencies, to grow their research portfolio by continuing to purchase commercial access to these new space stations as they currently do for the ISS. However, for the larger agencies, it is clear that the goal is moving BLEO [36]. For example, NASA’s Thriving in Space initiative [127], the Artemis program [128], and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. In this return to the Moon push, the Artemis program is effectively a return to the Apollo program for space biology, which means mass, size, power, and crew time will all be limiting to experiment design again. Similarly, the CLPS program is uncrewed and currently without sample return capabilities. For these reasons, autonomous experiments with data received by telemetry are essential, for example, the recently selected Lunar Explorer Instrument for Space Biology Applications (LEIA) payload. Cube-sats provide an ideal example of how to achieve this, with more than 1500 having previously flown and Biosentinal having already demonstrated that biology experiments beyond low Earth orbit can be successfully conducted [39]. Conducting an experiment such as ours on the Moon or another BLEO destination is technically feasible. Worms have previously been autonomously cultured on ISS for six months, with video data returned via telemetry [70]. Thus, the key challenges to testing worm strength on the Moon are designing culture chambers and strength measurement chambers to function in a cube-sat platform. Currently, funding for the development of hardware for use on the Moon is a challenge via the largest space agencies. Additionally, late load for biology payloads is a key requirement that is currently not accommodated by CLPS, so consideration of inert experiments that can be activated in flight is key. This is possible with C. elegans where developmentally arrested larvae have previously been restored to normal development once on orbit [129]. With new destinations for exploration come new challenges for space biology. However, cutting-edge experiments, such as those conducted here with C. elegans on ISS, are within technical reality for execution on the Moon or beyond.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions This study extends the growing literature base solidifying the general molecular features underpinning spaceflight-related health decline. By directly linking neuromuscular strength loss with increased stress response and reduced mitochondrial/cytoskeletal gene pathways, we provide a robust framework in which to develop targeted therapeutics against a primary maladaptation to space habitation. Our informatic pipeline, combined with the use of dys-1 muscle weakness mutants, further highlights perturbed calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling within neurons as primary candidates causing impaired neuromuscular strength in space. These findings provide the foundations for, and an in vivo model of, space-induced strength loss to employ on near-term missions beyond low Earth orbit and to the Moon.",

Copyright notice ID: 10605753 PMID: 37887314 Abstract Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

Introduction As a species, we have been working and living in space for more than 60 years, with continuous occupation for the last 23 years via the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. During this time, we have discovered that spaceflight induces numerous physiologic alterations, including but not limited to muscle and bone loss, structural changes in the eyes and brain, altered cardiovascular function, and altered cognitive function [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In some cases, we have developed effective countermeasures for these undesirable outcomes, but in other cases, understanding and countering the causes of these outcomes remain active areas of investigation. For example, adequate exercise and nutrition are sufficient to limit bone and muscle loss in astronauts onboard the ISS [10]. In contrast, causes of and countermeasures for alterations in the brain remain active areas of research [11]. As research advances, it has become increasingly clear that there are some molecular hallmarks of spaceflight [12], which include mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and epigenetic changes. Current challenges of space life sciences research include linking these molecular alterations to the physiologic ones as well as to the known spaceflight hazards. These hazards include distance from Earth, confinement, being in a hostile and closed environment, altered gravity, and increased and altered radiation exposure [12,13,14]. With our increased presence in space, our ability to conduct space medicine continues to improve. For example, we now understand that improved skin care is needed in flight due to the frequency of skin rashes [15]. Currently, there is an increased interest in personalized approaches for optimizing astronaut health [16,17,18,19,20]. For example, exercise and nutrition can be individually tailored to prevent muscle loss in flight [10,21]. The success of these approaches on Earth, combined with the increased use of -omics data in terrestrial medicine, has also led to using -omics approaches in astronauts [17,21,22,23]. While still in its infancy [24,25,26], it seems clear that combining -omics data from space-flown model organisms, such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and rodents, with astronaut data can accelerate the discovery process, in part by compensating for the current rarity of human space -omics datasets [22,27]. For example, C. elegans, rodents, and humans all display alterations in insulin-linked gene expression in response to spaceflight [28]. Given the central role of insulin in human health and longevity on Earth [29], it is highly likely this system is equally important to maintain in space. Indeed, recent data from space-flown rodents confirm that the liver–muscle axis is central to regulating both global metabolic health and muscle health functions the same in space as on Earth and that its perturbation may contribute to both liver and muscle pathology in flight [30]. While our advances in fundamental space life sciences and space medicine have been substantial, these are largely limited to habitation in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With planned government and commercial missions beyond LEO (BLEO), understanding fundamental changes to biological systems and countermeasures to detrimental alterations at new destinations, such as the Moon and Mars, are emerging challenges [31]. For example, current exercise countermeasures for maintaining muscle on the ISS are not feasible on currently planned spacecraft due to size constraints [32]. Similarly, storing adequate nutrition further away from Earth is operationally challenging [33,34,35]. Thus, despite not being a current priority for research on the ISS, understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy in space remains important for these new exploration class missions. Currently, designing space biology experiments for BLEO means that the experiments must be small and autonomous [36,37,38]. For example, using a CubeSat, such as Biosentinel [39], as a passive or mostly passive payload on Artemis [40], or an autonomous instrument on a Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission [41]. Thus, using standard flight genomic model organisms [27] that are small, such as bacteria, yeast, C. elegans, or Drosophila, is feasible. In terms of muscle strength, a microfluidic device has been developed for assessing strength in C. elegans [42], and this has been successfully used to both demonstrate decreased strength in mutants with defective muscle structure [43,44,45] and to identify drugs to improve strength both in muscle mutants [46] and with age [47]. Thus, the use of C. elegans for studying and countering muscle strength decline on the Moon is technically feasible, albeit challenging. The use of C. elegans in space biology has recently been reviewed [48,49,50]. Notably, past studies have demonstrated conserved gene expression changes in response to spaceflight between C. elegans, rodents, and humans. These include declines in muscle contractile genes [51], mitochondrial genes [12,52], and insulin signaling [28,53]. The knockdown of these genes on Earth is sufficient to induce strength decline [45,46]. Therefore, we hypothesized that worms would be weaker in space and aimed to directly test this on the micro-16 ISS payload, flown starting in February 2021 (NG-15 launch). The results from our experiment pave the way for testing pharmaceutical and nutrient countermeasures for strength decline in spaceflown C. elegans, as well as for testing C. elegans muscle strength at various BLEO destinations.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Worm Preparation Wild-type (wt) Bristol isolate (N2 [54]) and dystrophin (dys-1) mutant (BZ33 [55]) worms were maintained in C. elegans Maintenance Medium (CeMM) [56], purchased on contract from Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK. Cultures were established as previously described [49] and maintained at two separate sites (Texas Tech University, USA and University of Nottingham, UK). Ten days before the launch, approximately 1000 larvae from a stock culture were transferred into a Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bag (Saint Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, Solon, OH, USA) containing 20 mL CeMM at Texas Tech University (TTU). These primary culture bags and CeMM-Filled FEP bags were shipped to the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), Norfolk, on 10th February 2021. The culture bags were shipped with phase change material [57] at a temperature of 16 ± 2 °C. Upon arrival (following a lengthy delay of shipment in transit due to poor weather), culture bags were inspected for contamination and stored in the incubator at 22 °C for 2 days (flight bags) and 4 days (ground bags). The flight bags were handed over to NASA cold stowage on 17th February 2021 at a temperature of 15 ± 1 °C for the 20th February 2021 NG-15 launch. Ground control bags were sent to TTU, and the temperature profile of flight bags was replicated on a time delay of two days (Figure 1). Upon arrival at the ISS, the culture bags were incubated at 20 °C, and the CeMM bags were stored at 4 °C. Cultures were incubated for a week in microgravity before initiating the multigenerational culturing outlined in [49]. Briefly, 1 mL of culture was transferred to a fresh FEP bag containing CeMM every 2 weeks. All experiments used a starting mixed population of well-fed animals, with force measurements only being made on gravid adults. Upon experiment completion, ground bags at TTU were frozen and stored at −80 °C, while flight bags were frozen in the ISS MELFI at −80 °C until download to Earth via NASA cold stowage at −20 °C, followed by dry ice transport to TTU for storage at −80 °C. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Detailed temperature profile of the culture bags during shipping from TTU to EVMS and Launch. Bags were stored at 20 °C after receiving them at ISS and TTU Lab.2.2. Fabrication and Assembly of a Microfluidic Device in Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA) Devices were fabricated and assembled in WLA as previously described [42,49]. The micropillar-based NemaFlex-S device was fabricated using a modified two-step soft lithography process [58]. The mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 4″ silicon wafer as a substrate. First, a 20 μm tall photoresist layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the NemaFlex chamber. Next, a second layer of 80 μm height was fabricated on top of the initial layer. The second layer was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provided chambers with a depth of approximately 100 μm containing deformable pillars of 80 μm height. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices of 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thickness were cast using Sylgard 184 part A (base) and part B (curing agent) 10:1 by weight (Dow Corning) over the SU-8 mold by curing for approximately 2 h at 70 ± 1 °C. Inlet, outlet, and air vent holes were cored with a 1 mm hole puncher (Acuderm, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA). The devices were thoroughly cleaned with Scotch tape to remove dirt before bonding. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY, USA) for 90s and bonded to a 2 × 3 inch glass slide. Bonding was done, ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. The bonded devices were immediately placed in an oven for 10 min at 70 ± 1 °C. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min to prevent any bacterial build-up and reduce bubble formation during worm loading. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing the devices with DI water. The treated devices were soaked in DI water overnight at 20 ± 1 °C to release any air bubbles from the devices. Fabrication of devices took place at TTU, with devices shipped to EVMS. The microfluidic chips were shipped in Ziploc bags with DI water. Fabrication of WLA took place at BioServe Space Technologies, with WLA shipped to EVMS. Assembly took place at EVMS and was conducted by BioServe Space Technologies (Boulder, CO, USA).2.3. Image Acquisition and Processing The worms were loaded into NemaFlex-S chambers using a previously described procedure [49]. Briefly, a five-step process involving a syringe pump and NemaFlex-S device priming was used to transfer worms from FEP culture bags into the NemaFlex-S device for imaging in a semi-automated fashion. For on-orbit loading, an additional manual centrifugation of worms toward the loading port of the FEP bags was achieved by having the crew member swing the bag in a circular motion with the injection port pointed away from the crew member. Additionally, loading volumes on orbit were calibrated based upon the results of a training time point prior to the experimental time point and based upon crew member impressions of culture density for the experimental time point vs. the training time point. Once loaded, worms were allowed to habituate to the micropillar arena for approximately 10 min before imaging. One-minute-long videos of crawling worms were acquired with a Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse TS 100) at 4× magnification with a camera resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels recorded at 5 frames per second. All videos were recorded at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C. The recorded movies were processed offline using custom routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2018b) for the quantification of pillar displacements as previously published [42]. Recorded videos were analyzed manually using ImageJ (version 1.48 [59]) for measuring worm diameters at the mid-section and body length at the centerline of the worm. Videos were processed manually for quantification of coiling phenotyping. Adult worms were identified based on their body size and the presence of eggs.2.4. RNA Extraction, Sequencing and Data Pre-Processing RNA was extracted from frozen worm samples using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research cat# R2050). Two to three independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment. RNA concentration was determined using Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and next-generation sequencing were subsequently performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Hong Kong), with strand-specific (second strand cDNA synthesis with dUTP) 100 bp paired-end reads generated using the DNBseq platform. Cleaned reads (reads with adaptor sequences, contamination, and low-quality reads removed via the SOAPnuke software version 2.1.8 developed by BGI [60]) obtained from BGI were deemed to be of good quality (no over-represented sequences or adapter sequences, and median per base quality scores always >30, as determined using FastQC; Babraham Bioinformatics) and transcript-level abundances consequently estimated via pseudo-alignment to the C. elegans reference transcriptome (Ensembl release 108) using Kallisto (version 0.48.0 [61]). Gene counts were then inferred via the tximport R package (version 1.28.0 [62]), and lowly expressed genes were filtered out (genes with a count <10 in every sample) to leave 13,897 genes for downstream analyses.2.5. Gene Expression Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed via DESeq2 (version 1.40.2 [63]) in R (version 4.3.1). Beforehand, principal component analysis (PCA) of the top 500 most variable genes (with variance stabilizing transformed counts used as input) was undertaken for unsupervised clustering of samples. Wald tests were then used to test for differential gene expression, with pairwise comparisons made between flight and ground samples per strain, as well as between the ground samples of each strain and between the flight samples of each strain. Log fold-change shrinkage was performed using an adaptive shrinkage method (ashr) [64], and the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust p values to control for false discovery rate (FDR) [65]. Significant gene expression changes in each case were defined at the adjusted p < 0.05 level. Functional characteristics of differentially expressed gene lists were elucidated by undertaking over-representation analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the clusterProfiler R package [66]. In this case, each GO sub-category (biological process, cellular component, molecular function) was considered, with the corresponding background gene list being the genes input into differential expression testing. Enriched GO terms were defined as those with a Benjamini Hochberg corrected p < 0.05 [65]. Mapping of our gene expression data to established gene co-expression modules was conducted using the genemodules tool for C. elegans [67]. Briefly, this software applied an independent component analysis approach on a large collection of C. elegans microarray studies to identify clusters of genes with related gene expression patterns and then annotated these clusters based on their predicted molecular roles and functions. Tool 1 was used per pairwise comparison with log2 fold-change values of all genes subject to differential expression testing (i.e., the 13,897 genes that survived pre-filtering) as input in each case to determine the directional activity of the 209 defined transcriptional modules. Module descriptions potentially relevant to spaceflight and putative transcriptional regulators were subjectively assigned from Supplemental Table S2 (from [67]) and Tool 3. For drug target prediction, differentially expressed genes were first mapped to human orthologs using OrthoList2 [68] with one-to-many mapping. Following this, the QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-01) Upstream Regulator Analysis tool [69] was used on the human orthologs of significant differential expressed genes (adjusted p < 0.05), with the human orthologs for all genes used as input into differential expression testing serving as the reference/background set. Targets were considered inhibited if the activation Z-score was <−2 and activated if the activation Z-score was >2 [69]. Additionally, targets were only deemed significant if the Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected p value was <0.05 [65].3. Results 3.1. Growth Observation of ground control worms indicated that worm growth was as expected based upon results from the experiment verification test [49]. The crew assessed flight growth by eye based on perceived density (e.g., small or medium) of worms within FEP bags. Growth was adequate for the ability to load worms into NemaFlex-S devices as indicated by loading of 37 wt including 15 adults and 25 dys-1, including 13 adults on the crew’s training time point session. For the experimental time point, 41 wt including 30 adults and 49 dys-1 including 29 adults were loaded into the devices. For comparison, ground cultures for the experimental time point were 45 wt including 30 adults and 36 dys-1 including 25 adults loaded into the devices. These data suggest no major differences in development/reproduction in flight, consistent with past C. elegans flight data [70,71,72,73,74,75].3.2. Body Diameter and Length Force estimation using NemaFlex devices is dependent on adjustment for body diameter [42]. Therefore, the body diameter and length of both wt and dys-1 adult worms were measured from the recorded movies. The diameter of both strains cultured on ISS was significantly lower than both strains cultured on Earth (Figure 2a, Table 1). The body diameter of wt worms was 5.5% less, and in dys-1 worms, it was 7.9% less. The smaller diameter might be due to altered metabolism, as this has previously been reported for spaceflown C. elegans [52]. Indeed, our gene expression data are consistent with previously reported gene expression data for spaceflown C. elegans [48,51,52,53,76,77]. The length of both strains was not significantly different in flight than on the ground. Note that this contrasts with a previous flight where length decreased significantly by 5.5% [52]. This discrepancy could be because we used mixed populations of worms, whereas [52,78] used age-synchronized worms, or because we are using a different diet, which is known to profoundly impact C. elegans morphology and life history [79]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on body diameter and length of wt and dys-1 worms. (A) body diameter (B) body length. The diameters of both the strains grown at ISS are significantly different compared to ground controls, whereas there is no difference in the length of the worms. Sample size: n = 30 for wt ground and flight, n = 25 for dys-1 ground, and n = 29 for dys-1 flight. All the data pass the normality test. We used two-way ANOVA (Tukey multiple testing) for calculating significant differences; p < 0.001 is for ****.Table 1. The effect of space flight on body diameter, length, and muscle strength for adult wt and dys-1 worms.

Muscle Strength Strength was measured in the second generation in flight to reflect strength in worms wholly developed onboard ISS and with in-flight loading methods and video quality that had been tested on first generation from Earth prior to use with the experimental time point. To measure adult worms’ muscle strength, a 60-s-long video of crawling worms in NemaFlex-S chambers was recorded. The recorded videos were analyzed, and we identified the pillar with the maximal deflection in each image and generated a cumulative probability distribution with all the maximal deflections, as previously described [42]. We use the 95th percentile of this maximal force distribution, referred to as f95, as a measure of muscle strength. As shown in Figure 3, on Earth, gravid adult dys-1 worms are not significantly weaker than wt. This is consistent with previous reports where dys-1 mutants only display strength deficits vs. wt post day 1 of adulthood [44]. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on muscle strength of wt and dys-1 worms. There is no difference in muscle strength between the strains on the ground. The muscle strength of space-grown worms decreased by 16.6% and 33.4% for wt and dys-1, respectively. Sample size: n = 30 for wt ground and flight both, n = 25 for dys-1 ground, and n = 29 for dys-1 flight. All the data passed the normality test. We used two-way ANOVA (Tukey multiple testing) for calculating significant differences, * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and **** for p < 0.001.The muscle strength of the wt worms cultured onboard the ISS was significantly lower than on Earth (ground: f95 = 22.34 ± 5.67, flight f95 = 18.62 ± 4.05, n = 30 per group, p ≤ 0.05; Figure 3). Notably, the strength deficit (16%) was roughly similar to what is observed in astronauts’ muscles (6–14% [80]) and similar to the previously published quantitative changes in muscle contractile protein during flight (7–10% [51]). In flight, dys-1 mutants were also weaker than on Earth (ground: f95 = 21.38 ± 5.39, n = 25; flight f95= 14.23 ± 3.87, n = 29, p ≤ 0.001; Figure 3). It should be noted that the decrease in body diameter of both strains is similar in flight (see Figure 2 and Table 1), indicating the strength decrement is not due to the differences in the measurement technique. The strength in the dys-1 mutants was 23% less than wt worms onboard the ISS. This may reflect our small sample size or a difference in the response to spaceflight in dys-1 mutants vs. wild-type, as previously reported [81]. It could be that the altered neuromuscular health of dys-1 worms predisposes them to the negative effects of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system.3.4. Gene Expression Analysis Past gene expression analysis of spaceflown C. elegans has revealed decreased expression of muscle cytoskeletal genes and mitochondrial genes [48,51,52,77,82]. We have previously shown that mutation of some of these muscle genes results in decreased strength [45] and that declines in mitochondrial function also result in decreased strength [46,47], both in C. elegans on Earth. Therefore, to confirm that decreased expression of cytoskeletal genes or mitochondrial genes could be contributing to strength decline in flight, we measured gene expression in the same cultures of worms that we measured strength in, as well as two additional cultures. Unlike most past flights of C. elegans [48], we employed an unbiased approach to the analysis of gene expression (e.g., we did not focus solely on specific subsets of genes). As shown in Figure 4A, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the most variable genes showed a distinct clustering of samples in line with their experimental conditions. The tight clustering of samples within conditions indicates that the cultures without strength measures have similar gene expression profiles to the cultures from which strength measures were obtained. The first principal component (PC1), which accounted for 72.9% of the variance, separated the samples based on environment (i.e., flight vs. ground control). Meanwhile, the second principal component (PC2) differentiated the samples based on genetic background, distinguishing between wt and dys-1 mutant and explaining 13.5% of the variance. These results suggest that spaceflight is the main driver of the bulk of gene expression changes, while the dys-1 mutation has a lesser but significant effect. This is consistent with a past report demonstrating that dys-1 mutation has an impact on the transcriptional response to spaceflight [81]. The outlier genes driving the variation in the PCA are shown in Figure 4B. The descriptions of these genes match the descriptions of the clusters of genes identified in our module analysis below. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Global trends in spaceflight gene expression. (A) PCA clustering of samples based on top 500 most variable genes, (B) PCA loadings of top 500 most variable genes, (C) Volcano plots for wt flight vs. wt ground and dys-1 flight vs. dys-1 ground differential expression analyses. Annotated genes in each case are those ranked in the top 20 upregulated/downregulated based on log2 fold-change.In terms of Differential Expressed Genes (DEGs) with spaceflight, the distribution of expression changes is largely similar between the two strains, as shown in Figure 4C. While it is tempting to examine individual DEGs as meaningful, biological systems are complex, and genes do not act in isolation [83,84]. Therefore, we provide the full set of DEGs (Table S1) but limit discussion of changes to sets of genes with changing expression rather than individual genes. In terms of the genome level scale of changes with spaceflight (e.g., each strain’s flight response normalized against each strain’s ground control), 4726 genes displayed significant changes in expression in response to spaceflight, with 409 uniquely up in wt, 394 uniquely down in wt, 1069 uniquely up in dys-1, 765 uniquely down in dys-1, and 1295 up in both strains and 819 down in both strains (Figure 5A). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Overlay of wt and dys-1 transcriptome responses to spaceflight. (A) Overlay of genes upregulated by spaceflight in wt and/or dys-1 worms. Venn diagram illustrates the degree of commonality/uniqueness in spaceflight-upregulated genes between the two strains, while the heatmap depicts representative Gene Ontology (GO) terms for common/uniquely upregulated genes up in flight. Venn shows the commonality and differential changes in wt vs. dys-1. The able displays common and differential GO expression in wt vs. dys-1 (B) As per panel A but for genes downregulated by spaceflight.As shown in Figure 5B, gene ontology analysis of DEGs reveals changes in innate immune response as up in both strains, stress response as up in both strains and metabolism and cytoskeleton as down in both. These changes are broadly similar to past analyses of space-flown C. elegans where the stress response is up and metabolic and cytoskeletal genes are down [48,51,52,53,77]. These gene expression changes could underlie the strength decline in flight as strength goes down in both strains. These gene expression changes could also potentially underlie the decrease in muscle size that has previously [85] and recently been reported for other spaceflown C. elegans [86]. Changes not likely to underlie strength decline in both strains in flight include upregulation of protein synthesis in dys-1 in flight and decreased neural development/function in dys-1 in flight. C. elegans was the first multicellular animal for which a transcriptional co-regulation map was generated [87]. This map has recently been updated [67], employing advances in both DEG identification and analysis [88,89,90,91,92]. When wt and dys-1 DEGs are analyzed for the effect of spaceflight vs. ground controls, three modules are inhibited in response to space flight, and four modules are activated in both wt and dys-1 (Figure 6A). Only one module is uniquely activated in wt, whereas three are uniquely activated in dys-1 (Figure 6A). These observations are consistent with spaceflight being the major driver of gene expression changes (Figure 4A). The modules inhibited in both include identifications (Figure 6B) consistent with past spaceflight experiments [48]. Module 65 was previously [67] specifically identified as responsive to spaceflight and other environmental conditions and may be controlled by the transcription factor DAF-16 [93], amongst others, where DAF-16 has been suggested to be a controller of C. elegans response to spaceflight [52,53,77,94]. Module 169 is a HIF-1 [95] responsive module [67] and is associated with mitochondrial function. This is consistent with both past C. elegans gene expression changes and the recent observation that decreased mitochondrial gene expression is a fundamental feature of biological alterations in response to spaceflight [96]. Notably, this module may also be regulated [67] by SKN-1 [97], which has also previously been suggested to be a transcription factor regulating the response to spaceflight [53]. Module 185 is associated with calcium handling in neurons and may be regulated [67] by UNC-89 [98] and DAF-19 [99]. This module is particularly interesting following recent observations that neuronal morphology [100] and neurotransmitter production [76] are altered in C. elegans in flight. Similarly, altered calcium handling in aging C. elegans muscle has recently been shown to negatively impact mitochondrial health [101] and, therefore, might be an alternative mechanism by which mitochondrial gene expression declines in response to spaceflight. In terms of commonly activated modules, modules 47 and 118 are both responsive to mitochondrial stress [67], which is consistent with modules 65 and 169 being inhibited. Potential transcriptional regulators of these modules are displayed in (Figure 6C). Module 61 is associated with response to inhibited Acetylcholinesterase [67], which is consistent with Acetylcholinesterase gene expression being decreased in response to spaceflight in C. elegans [53]. Module 151 is associated with desmosomal cell adhesion and calcium metabolism in the hypodermis [67]. This result contrasts decreased cell adhesion in C. elegans [51,52] and human muscle [102] in response to spaceflight. It could be that this response is unique to C. elegans as they have a hydrostatic skeleton that would be predicted to be altered by spaceflight. It could be related to alterations in global calcium homeostasis in C. elegans and the potential regulation of mitochondria via both calcium and cadherins in C. elegans [47,101], or it could be an over compensation of adhesome structures as a response to failure as recently suggested for aging human muscle [103]. As with the DEG GO analysis, the module analysis identifies decreased expression of mitochondrial metabolism genes and increased expression of mitochondrial/other stress response genes as a potential cause of the decreased strength in flight. Unlike the DEG GO analysis, the module analysis also suggests decreased neuronal function and specifically altered acetylcholine signal from nerve to muscle (and consequent post-synaptic remodeling of excitation–contraction coupling) as another potential contributor to strength decline in flight. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cluster analysis to identify coexpressed gene modules. (A) Activity of gene co-expression modules in flight vs. ground control comparison. (B) Activity of gene co-expression modules in dys-1 vs. wt comparisons. (C) Table of module annotations and summarized activation between pairwise comparisons.Consistent with the past report that dys-1 modulates the DEG in response to spaceflight [81], our DEG (Figure 5) and module analysis (Figure 6) confirm dys-1 modulates the DEG response to spaceflight. As shown in Figure 6A, module 77 is uniquely activated in wt and is responsive to mitochondrial stress [67]. Interestingly, module 77 is significantly activated in dys-1 vs. wt on the ground (Figure 6B), potentially explaining the lack of further significant activation in dys-1 in flight. Activation of this module at baseline is not surprising given the impact of dys-1 on mitochondrial function [44,46,104] and gene expression [105]. Consistent with a baseline mitochondria stress response in dys-1, the modules uniquely activated in dys-1 in response to flight include a stress-responsive module (29) [106] that includes the dystrophin-associated protein Dystrobrevin, a neuromuscular function module (18), and a protein translation in muscle module (93) (Figure 6). The activation of these modules suggests that the baseline neuromuscular dysfunction in dys-1 is exacerbated by the added negative effect(s) of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system. Interestingly, three modules that are inhibited at baseline in dys-1 do not alter in response to spaceflight (Figure 6B,C). These are module 6, metabolic response to starvation, module 86, response to mitochondrial stress, and module 149, response to iron stress, pH, and starvation [67]. This, again, suggests that the baseline neuromuscular dysfunction in dys-1 is exacerbated by the added negative effect(s) of spaceflight on the neuromuscular system. This may explain why dys-1 are significantly weaker in flight than wt (small sample size being the other obvious reason).3.5. Genes Predicted to Be Altered in Space Are Predicted to Be Altered by Drugs on Earth With the increased interest in precision medicine in space, the commercialization of space, and the rise of synthetic biology [107,108,109], astropharmacy has recently emerged as a recognized field of specialization [110,111]. The goals of astropharmacy mirror those of pharmacy on Earth but with a specific focus on medication storage [112,113,114,115], access [114,115], use, and manufacturing beyond Earth [111,116]. Current challenges include understanding how detrimental physiological changes in flight might be countered by existing medications, how medications may work differently in flight, and how to ensure our explorers receive the best possible outcome while minimizing side effects despite limited resources. Having found a number of gene expression changes that were conserved with past missions [48,51,52,53,76,77] and profiles indicative of pathways that medications target (e.g., mitochondria, metabolism, neurotransmitters), we were curious if drugs might be predicted to act differently in flight. Therefore, we explored the potential of using drug target predictions to identify compounds that might work better or worse in flight based upon spaceflight-induced gene expression changes. As shown in Figure 7, QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identifies 31 drugs as being regulators of genes whose expression is either increased or decreased in flight. These results suggest, unsurprisingly, that pharmacological activity is likely to be affected, resulting in alterations of medication’s efficacy and safety profile in flight, based upon underlying alterations in gene expression due to not only physiological changes in spaceflight but also further exacerbation by alterations in gene expressions due to medications, such as on the list. Potential consequences include the need for dose adjustments, changes to classic first-line treatment options, and ultimately, for drug selection to be optimized through pharmacogenomics and/or modeling. Clearly, this is an important area of future research as we begin to live and work on other celestial bodies with a more diverse population with different comorbidities needing a better understanding of astropharmacy. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Heatmap of chemical and biologic drug targets predicted to be significantly activated or inhibited for significantly upregulated (UR) and downregulated (DR) genes from the wt flight vs. wt ground condition, highlighting the potential for alteration in therapeutic potential in the context of spaceflight-induced changes.4. Discussion Historically, space biology experiments have been constrained by mass, power, size, and crew time limitations [117]. Now, with a functional ISS, there is functional laboratory equipment, such as the microscope we employed in this study, and crew time for carrying out complex tasks, such as our experiment or extracting and sequencing DNA on ISS [118]. With these improved abilities to conduct science, we were able to extend past studies using C. elegans in space to include capture not only of transcriptomic data [48] but to study physiology more comprehensively than simple movement analysis [49]. Using our NemaFlex-S, we were successfully able to measure worm strength both in flight and on the ground. Using these extended capabilities, we were able to test and confirm the hypothesis that worms, like people [119], are weaker in space. This demonstration extends our understanding of muscle response to spaceflight by demonstrating that not only are the molecular changes in muscle sarcomeric gene expression driven by altered MyoD expression conserved between worms and people [51], but so too are the functional consequences. These technical advances and increased knowledge may now be combined to test various nutrient and pharmaceutical interventions to improve muscle strength in flight, as we have recently been able to do for DMD and aging muscle on Earth [46,47]. This experiment presents an example of how near-simultaneous in-flight collection of -omics alongside phenotypic measures can enable insights into the potential molecular mechanisms behind spaceflight-associated physiological deconditioning [120]. Response of gene expression to spaceflight has gained increased interest in the past few years, principally due to the implementation of NASA’s GeneLab program [121]. This has even resulted in introducing network biology into scientific roadmaps, for example ESA’s Biology roadmap 9E [122]. At the simplest level, DEG analysis focuses on individual genes, while this may be useful, it ignores the power of big data, such as reproducibility [123] across experiments and systems and may be biased based upon differences in computational approach/pipeline [124]. For example, the gene identified as most downregulated in this study was previously identified as one of the most upregulated in the first unbiased whole genome response of C. elegans to flight [77]. This difference could also be due to operational differences in the two missions. In contrast, our use of GO and network/module analysis has, once again [48], revealed a consistent and reproducible change in gene expression in C. elegans in response to spaceflight. A key finding of this study is that strength decreases in flight. As discussed above, declines in mitochondrial gene expression are repeatedly observed in response to spaceflight [48] and are a treatable cause of strength decline on Earth [46,47]. Therefore, testing of mitochondrial interventions to reverse strength decline in space is now required to determine if the correlation between strength and mitochondrial decline is causal or not. Additionally, as our gene annotation and computational skills improve, it is possible to obtain more knowledge from gene expression data than in the past. For example, our module analysis reveals that certain gene expression changes can be attributed to specific tissues (for example, cell adhesion in the hypodermis), whereas others are more universal (for example, mitochondrial stress). Further, our new analysis reveals that calcium metabolism in neurons is also a potential cause of strength decline in space, more specifically by altering acetylcholine signaling, again suggesting an interventional study is required to (dis)prove the casualty of this link. This suggestion, unsurprisingly, has also previously been made for human strength decline in flight [125,126]. As we confront the new age of commercial spaceflight, it remains unclear how experiments such as ours will be possible on as yet unbuilt commercial space stations. The largest space agencies (the Japanese Space Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not announced any plans for funding scientists to conduct research on such platforms. Given that the US National Lab program relies on scientists to provide their own funding, it seems current US policy may continue, and there will be no funding for academic research on commercial space stations provided by the US government. Clearly, this is an opportunity for smaller agencies, such as the United Kingdom, the Australian, the Italian, and the United Arab Emirates Space Agencies, to grow their research portfolio by continuing to purchase commercial access to these new space stations as they currently do for the ISS. However, for the larger agencies, it is clear that the goal is moving BLEO [36]. For example, NASA’s Thriving in Space initiative [127], the Artemis program [128], and the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. In this return to the Moon push, the Artemis program is effectively a return to the Apollo program for space biology, which means mass, size, power, and crew time will all be limiting to experiment design again. Similarly, the CLPS program is uncrewed and currently without sample return capabilities. For these reasons, autonomous experiments with data received by telemetry are essential, for example, the recently selected Lunar Explorer Instrument for Space Biology Applications (LEIA) payload. Cube-sats provide an ideal example of how to achieve this, with more than 1500 having previously flown and Biosentinal having already demonstrated that biology experiments beyond low Earth orbit can be successfully conducted [39]. Conducting an experiment such as ours on the Moon or another BLEO destination is technically feasible. Worms have previously been autonomously cultured on ISS for six months, with video data returned via telemetry [70]. Thus, the key challenges to testing worm strength on the Moon are designing culture chambers and strength measurement chambers to function in a cube-sat platform. Currently, funding for the development of hardware for use on the Moon is a challenge via the largest space agencies. Additionally, late load for biology payloads is a key requirement that is currently not accommodated by CLPS, so consideration of inert experiments that can be activated in flight is key. This is possible with C. elegans where developmentally arrested larvae have previously been restored to normal development once on orbit [129]. With new destinations for exploration come new challenges for space biology. However, cutting-edge experiments, such as those conducted here with C. elegans on ISS, are within technical reality for execution on the Moon or beyond.5. Conclusions This study extends the growing literature base solidifying the general molecular features underpinning spaceflight-related health decline. By directly linking neuromuscular strength loss with increased stress response and reduced mitochondrial/cytoskeletal gene pathways, we provide a robust framework in which to develop targeted therapeutics against a primary maladaptation to space habitation. Our informatic pipeline, combined with the use of dys-1 muscle weakness mutants, further highlights perturbed calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling within neurons as primary candidates causing impaired neuromuscular strength in space. These findings provide the foundations for, and an in vivo model of, space-induced strength loss to employ on near-term missions beyond low Earth orbit and to the Moon.Acknowledgments C. elegans strains were provided by the CGC, which is funded by  Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells12202470/s1, Table S1: RNA-Seq_analysis_data.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies. IMPORTANCE While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.KEYWORDS: nutritional supplements, flux balance analysis, genome-scale metabolic models, Caenorhabditis elegans, Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, serine",

Copyright notice ID: 10846184 PMID: 38230938 Previous version available: This article is based on a previously available preprint posted on bioRxiv on February 18, 2023: \"Metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through precision prebiotics\". ABSTRACT While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies. IMPORTANCE While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.KEYWORDS: nutritional supplements, flux balance analysis, genome-scale metabolic models, Caenorhabditis elegans, Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, serineINTRODUCTION While traditionally considered commensals, it is becoming increasingly clear that the microbial communities living within and on higher host organisms (i.e., the microbiome) are integral parts of host physiology. These microbial communities fulfill essential roles in pathogen protection (1), immune system education (2), production of vitamins (3), metabolism of xenobiotics (4, 5), and increase the plasticity of their host to respond to evolutionary challenges (6, 7). Thus, the composition of the microbiota plays an important role in the well-being of hosts and its ability to respond to environmental challenges (8, 9), as indicated by the frequent shift of microbiota composition observed in the context of diseases (10) and exposure to environmental stressors (11). These observations and work in animal models have led to the development of the notion that the composition of the microbiome itself might be an important modulator of host health (12) as well as fitness and that a targeted modulation of microbiome composition might offer a completely new avenue for modulating the host. It has been shown that dietary patterns (e.g., western diet) can affect the structure of the microbiome, however their effect is transient (13). Besides an influence of dietary uptake on microbiome composition, various approaches to modify the microbial communities of organisms have been used (14): the transfer of entire microbial communities from a donor to a recipient host (fecal transfer), the provision of compounds used by particular microbial species (prebiotics), the provision of microbial strains of natural or synthetic origin (probiotics), the provision of compounds of microbial origin (postbiotics), and combinations thereof (synbiotics). While fecal transfer is the most commonly used approach to modulate microbial community composition in animal models, it involves the transfer of entire microbial communities and therefore not only desirable traits. In consequence, there is only a single medical indication in which fecal transfers are routinely used thus far (15) and there are potential concerns about the safety and stability of the engraftment of transplants (16). Although the concept of supplementation with pre-, pro-, or synbiotics has been commonly proposed as a method of microbial manipulation, these approaches are still severely limited. In humans, oligosaccharides are proposed as prebiotics to alter the microbial community on both the structural and functional level, since they can be fermented by microbial species, which in turn can proliferate and produce bioactive compounds such as short-chain fatty acids (17). However, there is only little knowledge about other classes of compounds that might alter the microbial composition. Another important aspect to consider is the specificity with which individual target microorganisms can be manipulated using prebiotics. Thus, while oligosaccharides are considered beneficial, there is often uncertainty about which species can degrade them, as multiple, unrelated species can degrade similar types of oligosaccharides (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacterium species can degrade fructans) (17, 18). In case of supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics, other concerns have been raised. For instance, the ability of specific Bifidobacteria to stably colonize the human gut was only reported for ⅓ of the participants in a clinical trial (19). Moreover, introducing exogenous bacteria can have unwanted side effects. For example, some of the Bacillus species that were used as probiotics in aquacultures were found to carry virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes (20). Hence, to overcome these limitations in current microbiome manipulation approaches, we need to focus on prebiotics with well-controlled modes of action (e.g., based on known microbial pathways that can degrade prebiotics) that preferentially modulate the abundance of resident microbial species. Since mechanisms of pathogenicity are often complex and context-specific (21), it is preferred if these species are native to the microbiome of the host, as unwanted side-effects due to the introduction of foreign bacterial species might be avoided. Within this work, we will refer to prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of selected bacterial strains within the microbiome of a specific host as “precision prebiotics.” To design and evaluate such precision prebiotics, it is essential to start with a tractable model system such as the well-established model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The native microbial community of the invertebrate C. elegans was first described in 2016 (22), yet the nematode has already been used for over 20 years as a model for studying host-microbial interactions (23). To similarly promote C. elegans-microbiome research, a synthetic 12-member C. elegans-specific microbiome resource, CeMbio, was recently established (24). Part of this consortium is the Gram-negative Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 that is known to possess antifungal (22) and antimicrobial properties, thereby providing protection against the pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (21, 25). Besides its protective effects, MYb11 is known to colonize and persist in the C. elegans intestine (22) and thus increase the nematode’s fitness during infection (25). Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 is another member of the CeMbio community (24) and affects different host life-history traits (24, 26, 27), persistently colonizes the nematode (22), and has been described as competitive against other bacteria in terms of space and nutrients (27). Furthermore, the bacterial strain MYb11 was only able to grow on sucrose when co-cultured with MYb71 but not when cultured alone, suggesting that the two bacterial strains interact metabolically (27). Hence, a microbial community consisting of one beneficial bacterium and another one that is competitive offers an excellent opportunity for developing targeted approaches for microbiome manipulation. A key prerequisite for the development of precision prebiotics is a detailed understanding of the metabolic functions present within a microbial community and how specific metabolic interventions affect microbiome metabolism. One important approach to investigate metabolic functions in microbial communities is constraint-based metabolic modeling (28–30). Based on the genetic information either on the level of each bacterium or from the overall community and biochemical databases, these methods allow one to simulate the network of chemical reactions that represent the metabolic reactions of the microorganism(s) or the community (31). To this end, genome-scale metabolic models of the bacterial species within a microbiome have to be reconstructed from genomic data. These models summarize the metabolic functions present within an organism and can be reconstructed using automated reconstruction approaches (32, 33) or obtained from existing model repositories (34). Furthermore, accounting for the growth environment of a species (35), optimization approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA) for individual species (28) or constraint-based community modeling approaches (36, 37) can be used to predict metabolic activities within individual species as well as interactions between species. These methods have already been used to identify metabolic alterations in the microbiome of Parkinson’s disease patients (38) as well as patients with inflammatory bowel disease (39) and to study the interaction of C. elegans as well as its microbiota in the context of drug-microbiome-host interactions (30). For C. elegans, metabolic models of the CeMbio community including MYb11 and MYb71 (24) and other members of the microbiota are available (27). In this work, we used metabolic networks of MYb11 and MYb71 also incorporating phenotypic information from Biolog growth assays in a computational screen for precision prebiotics that are able to specifically boost the abundance of the host-protective strain MYb11 over MYb71. We tested four of the predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro and confirmed that they selectively boost the abundance of MYb11. Moving to the C. elegans host system, we moreover showed that L-serine is able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 when the C. elegans host was colonized with both bacterial species. Thus, we demonstrate that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches could represent a key tool for the design of targeted microbiome intervention approaches.MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational methods Identification of unique uptake compounds We explored to what extent individual metabolites, which are only taken up by a single bacterial species and no other, could serve as potential supplements to target individual species. To this end, we considered gut microbiome data from a Kiel-based human cohort comprising 1,280 participants for which 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is available, which we had utilized previously (30). As reported previously, the reads were mapped to the 16S sequences of the genomes of bacterial species present in the AGORA bacterial collection (34), the read counts of each sample were normalized to a sum of 1 and removal of species below 0.1% abundance in each sample. We used gapseq version 1.1 (32) on the genomes of the identified species assuming the averaged dietary uptake of the human cohort (30) as input to the models to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models. Subsequently, we identified for each bacterial species which metabolites can be taken up. To this end, for each exchange reaction of a metabolite, we set the respective reaction as an objective reaction. By convention, bacterial uptake of metabolites is modeled by exchange reactions where the forward direction corresponds to an excretion of a compound and the backward direction (i.e., negative flux) to its uptake. Therefore, we minimized the flux through each exchange reaction using FBA (40) implemented in the R-package sybil (41) which corresponds to maximizing the uptake of that metabolite. If the minimal flux through the exchange reaction was non-zero this metabolite could be taken up. Having repeated this procedure for each exchange reaction, we identified those compounds that can be taken up for each species. Then, we determined for each individual bacterial species in the gut microbiome of each participant whether it could take up a compound that could not be taken up by any other species in the bacterial community of this participant. Finally, we determined for each participant which fraction of the bacterial species contained in the gut microbiome had at least one unique uptake compound. Similarly, we reconstructed 78 bacterial models belonging to the C. elegans microbiota based on their published genomes (27) using gapseq version 1.2 (32). We then created random subsets of the models with increasing sizes (from 2 to 78, 50 iterations for each size) and determined the portion of strains with unique uptake compounds for each community. For the CeMbio community we used metabolic models reconstructed with gapseq 1.2 (32) from Zimmermann et al. (42). In general, the software gapseq (32) has an extensive published documentation regarding the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models, also available online (https://gapseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).Computational supplementation experiments In our simulations, we utilized metabolic networks of P. lurida MYb11 and O. vermis MYb71 that were created from their genome sequences (27) using gapseq (32) version 1.1. Information from phenotypic microarrays about the organisms' metabolic capacities was integrated into the models using the “adapt” module of gapseq. Specifically, we incorporated data from the Biolog EcoPlate (assuming growth if OD590–OD750 >0.1) (24). During growth simulations, exchange fluxes of the models were constrained by assuming a computational nematode growth medium (NGM) (30) and aerobic conditions. These constraints can be found in Table S1. Additionally, the inflow of copper and iron cations was increased, so that they did not restrict the growth of the models. Following published practices (36) and due to the lack of the required kinetic information, we used the concentration values of the NGM medium input for the lower bounds of the models. We used three distinct approaches for modeling individual microbes and microbial communities. To model the growth of each bacterium independently, we used FBA (40). We also utilized individual-based modeling based on BacArena (36) R-package and a community-FBA as described previously (39, 43, 44). The community-FBA approach is implemented in the R-package MicrobiomeGS2 (www.github.com/Waschina/MicrobiomeGS2) and an overview has been described in detail in the publication by Pryor et al. (30). To measure the effects of supplements on growth of the individual species, we modified the published approach, so that we did not fix species composition but let it be determined as part of the optimization of individual species biomasses. In all types of simulations, we focused on the identification of nutritional supplements that boosted the growth of the target species MYb11. For the individual supplementation experiments, the metabolic models of both organisms were constrained with the NGM computational diet, assuming that the molecular values of the dietary compounds (molecular quantities) can be directly incorporated into the models (as fluxes in the lower bounds of the models) without any transformation. This is based on the assumption that the uptake rate of compounds is depicted by its maximum available amount (36). Supplementations for each metabolite were conducted by increasing the possible influx of the supplemented metabolite by 10 mmol/L. For testing the effects of supplements on single growth, the relative increase in growth rate compared to growth without supplements for each model was recorded. To prevent any numerical instabilities, all raw values were rounded to the sixth digit and relative changes bigger than 0.01 were taken into account. For simulations using community FBA, the metabolic models of both organisms were merged into one microbial community, compartmentalized, model. Please note that we did not use a fixed community biomass composition as previously (30), since we employed community FBA to predict the resulting growth rates of individual species after maximizing the growth of the community. Thus, the community model was constrained with the NGM diet—extended with the individual supplements, as described in the previous paragraph. The growth rates of individual species were predicted by maximizing the sum of the growth rates of individual species with concomitant minimization of the sum of total fluxes as implemented in the R-package sybil (41) (with a coefficient of −10−6 for the sum of fluxes in the objective function). Since the supplementations usually also increased the growth of the entire community, the predicted growth rates of each species were normalized with the respective growth rate of the community. Predicted growth rates following supplementation were contrasted against growth rates without supplementation to identify compounds whose effect was larger for the growth of MYb11 in comparison to MYb71. To exclude any numerical artifacts, rounding to the sixth digit and a cutoff of 0.01 in compound selection were also applied in this section. For individual-based modeling of microbial communities, the metabolic models of both species were simulated in a virtual environment in BacArena, where they could randomly move and reproduce (36) on a 30 × 30 grid. As a growth medium, we used the NGM diet (in mM) which we diluted 1,000-fold, because otherwise bacterial models overgrew the entire simulation environment before nutrients were exhausted. For the simulations, we inoculated the growth environment with 20 individuals of each species and simulated bacterial growth for 12 iterations with 15 replicates for each supplementation using FBA. Replicates are needed since, in contrast to FBA, BacArena includes a stochastic component such as a random initial placement of individuals, random movement of individuals and random cellular replication events. A secondary objective to minimize the total flux while maximizing the growth rates of individuals was applied. To simulate the supplementation experiments, 0.01 mM of each compound of interest was added once in the beginning of the simulation. To identify significant changes in the growth profiles of individual species following each supplementation, we extracted the cell biomass information from the simulations using the command plotGrowthCurve and we calculated the relative change of the total biomass values (time step 13; rounding to the sixth digit) due the supplementations for each model. Then, the relative changes between the bacterial models were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (45). The resulting P values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate control implemented in R. We selected those compounds whose effect on MYb11 was larger than on MYb71 based on the median of the respective relative changes for each model. Based on these simulation techniques, we identified those compounds that specifically boosted MYb11 across the simulations. Subsequently, we subsetted this list to compounds for which we had positive confirmation of their uptake by MYb11 from Biolog experiments (24, 27). For the enrichment analysis of growth-supporting compounds of MYb11, we used the human metabolome database (HMDB) annotation for the available metabolite classes (46). Briefly, we tested whether the sets of candidate compounds were enriched in the metabolite classes defined in HMDB using Fisher’s exact test. As the underlying set of metabolites, we used the metabolites contained in the metabolic model of MYb11 in the different metabolite classes.System information and software Simulations and analyses were performed in the R environment (versions 4.0.0, 4.0.3, and 4.2.1). Model reconstructions were performed with the gapseq software (versions 1.1 and 1.2) (32) Optimizations were generally conducted using the software sybil (versions 2.1.5 and 2.2.0) (41). Specifically, multi-model supplementation was conducted using the software MicrobiomeGS2 (version 0.1.5, www.github.com/Waschina/MicrobiomeGS2) and the in-silico co-culturing was simulated on BacArena (version 1.8.2, commit fdb02bf7) (36). Both incorporate sybil in their pipelines. The linear programming solver was CPLEX (versions 12.10.0 and 22.1.0), based on the R package cplexAPI (version 1.4.0). For data management, the software dplyr (versions 1.0.2, 1.0.4, and 1.0.9), tidyr (version 1.1.3), tidyverse (version 1.3.2) (47), and data.table (version 1.14.2) were used. For parallel computing, the software foreach (version 1.5.0 and 1.5.1) and doMC (version 12.10.0) were used. For plotting, the software ggplot2 (versions 3.3.3 and 3.3.6) (48), egg (version 0.4.5), and ggVennDiagram (version 1.2.2.) were utilized.Experimental methods Bacterial strains To determine bacterial growth in mono- and co-culture either in the presence or absence of supplementation, similarly to the computational section, the two naturally associated C. elegans microbiota isolates P. lurida MYb11 and O. vermis MYb71 were used. Fluorescently labeled MYb11::dTomato (21) and MYb71::GFP were used to distinguish the two bacterial species in a mixed community. For comparison, reverse labels were also tested, using MYb71::dTomato and MYb11::sfGFP, to ensure no impact of the fluorescent label (Fig. S2). Integrated fluorescent strains of MYb71 and the MYb11::sfGFP strain were constructed by transposon insertion at the attTn7 site following published work (49). Briefly, two populations of Escherichia coli SM10 strains were prepared: (i) a donor strain containing either pTn7xKS-sfGFP (pTW415) or pTn7xKS-dTomato (pTW416) plasmids, and (ii) a helper strain containing the pTNS2 (pTW10) plasmid. Liquid cultures (5 mL LB) of donor, helper (both 37°C) and target strains (26°C) were grown with agitation overnight, subcultured, and collected at an OD 0.4–0.6. Tripartite mating mixtures consisted of equal parts (1:1:1), incubated overnight at 26°C, followed by selection on LB agar plates containing gentamicin (10 µg/mL) and IPTG (1 mM). Fluorescent colonies of MYb71 were verified by PCR and sequencing using two pairs of MYb71-specific primers to the glmS gene region: (i) oDB097 (5′-CGCTCTGATCGATGAGACC-3′) and oDB098 (5′-TTGCGCGGCTGRTCGAC-3′), and (ii) oDB097 and a transposon WP11 primer (5′-CACGCCCCTCTTTAATACGA-3′) (49). MYb11::sfGFP was similarly confirmed by PCR and sequencing, following our previous protocol (21). Bacteria were thawed from frozen stocks for each experiment, streaked to tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and grown for 16–42 h at 25°C. Bacterial cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were grown in liquid NGM overnight at 28°C in a shaking incubator. Cultures were adjusted to OD600 = 0.5 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). We combined equal volumes of the adjusted cultures and used these as starting co-cultures for all experiments with the two strains, thus ensuring identical starting conditions across experimental treatments, as required for inference of an influence of the experimental manipulation on relative bacterial abundances.Supplementation in vitro L-serine (1714.1), D-mannitol (8883.1), and L-threonine (T206.1) were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), and GABA (A2129) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and dissolved to 1 M or 0.5 M stocks in water, depending on the maximum soluble concentration. Liquid NGM was supplemented with a final concentration of 10 mM of the respective supplement. For supplementation assays in vitro, 5 µL of either mono- or co-culture of the bacteria was added to 95 µL of liquid NGM in a 96-well plate, in the presence or absence of supplement. Treatments were randomized with respect to plate layout. Plates were incubated at 28°C for 24 h in an Epoch2 BioTek plate reader with double orbital shaking at 807 CPM. We assessed changes in bacterial abundances by quantifying the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of a sample of the cultures plated out on agar, because this allows us to distinguish between the two strains, which is not possible using standard OD measurements. For this approach, 7 µL of different dilutions of each treatment bacterial suspension of respective mono- or co-cultures was plated onto TSA plates. The plates were stored at 25°C and CFUs scored after 24–48 h. Statistical calculations and plots were performed with R software (version 4.1.3). For all CFU assays in vitro, statistical comparisons were performed with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (45).Supplementation in vivo The C. elegans strain N2 was used for all in vivo experiments and was originally obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). Worms were maintained on NGM plates inoculated with E. coli OP50 at 20°C following standard procedures (50). Assay plates were prepared by adding L-serine at a concentration of 0, 10, or 100 mM to NGM. Please note that serine can affect C. elegans foraging behavior (51). However and importantly for our proof-of-concept study, none of the numerous C. elegans foraging studies [including our own long-term experience (52–54)] indicated that this nematode is capable of a differential uptake of distinct bacterial strains from a mixed bacterial lawn. Therefore, any possible change in serine-induced nematode behavior is unlikely to cause any changes in the relative abundance of bacterial strains in the C. elegans gut—as long as identical starting cultures are used across experimental treatments, which we ensured with our experimental protocol. Overnight cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were adjusted to OD600 = 2.0 in PBS. Thirty to forty synchronized first instar larvae (L1) were grown on supplemented NGM plates inoculated with 125 µL of respective mono- or co-culture of MYb11 and MYb71. After 72 h, bacterial lawns were sampled by pressing the circular end of a 200-µL pipette tip into the lawn, avoiding the edges and any worms. The resulting disc was homogenized in PBS with zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 (Omni International) for 3 min at 30 Hz. To assess the number of CFU, worms were washed off plates using M9-buffer + 0.025% Triton X-100, washed five times and paralyzed with 5 mM tetramisole to stop pumping of the worms as described in (24). Worms were surface-sterilized following (24), then washed two times in PBS to remove residual bleach. Worms were transferred to a new tube to determine the exact worm number (~20) and PBS was added to a final volume of 400 µL. Worms were allowed to settle and 100 µL supernatant was collected (supernatant control). Worms were homogenized in the remaining PBS using 1 mm zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 for 3 min at 30 Hz. Homogenized worms, lawns, and supernatants were serially diluted in PBS and plated on TSA plates. After up to 48 h at 25°C, the colonies were scored at the appropriate dilutions and the CFUs per worm were calculated. Each colonization experiment was conducted in three independent runs and equal biological replicates. Data were pooled across runs, and a mixed model controlling for runs was used to assess the effect of L-serine supplementation on bacterial colonization in C. elegans. For all L-serine in vitro and in vivo experiments, statistical comparisons were performed with generalized linear models, if not otherwise mentioned. We calculated the expected proportion of MYb11 in worms as the product of MYb11 proportions available on the lawns and the observed shift in bacterial proportions due to host filtering: E(Prop. MYb11 in supplemented worms)=(Prop. MYb11 onsupplemented lawns)×Prop. MYb11 in wormsProp. MYb11 on lawns Plots and statistical analysis were produced with R (version 4.1.3) and edited with Inkscape (version 1.1.2).RESULTS Overlapping metabolic niches between microbiome member species prevent the use of unique uptake compounds as precision prebiotics The simplest approach to specifically boost the abundance of a particular bacterial species in a microbial community is to supply the community with a compound that is only taken up by the target species but no other species. Hence, these compounds correspond to unique metabolic niches for the respective bacterial species. We initially tested computationally whether such unique uptake compounds typically exist in bacterial communities, using bacterial communities from a human cohort as well as C. elegans (30). We evaluated for each bacterial species of a particular community whether it was able to take up a metabolite that no other species of the community could take up and determined the fraction of bacterial species in the community that had such unique uptake compounds (see Materials and Methods). For the human cohort, the bacterial communities comprised on average 26–34 bacterial species (25–75% quantiles). Within this community size, on average, 5–20% of bacterial species were inferred to possess unique uptake compounds that could potentially be used to target those species. For smaller communities, up to 50% of bacterial species and for larger communities, only 5–10% had unique uptake compounds (Fig. 1A). For C. elegans, we do not have matching data like for the human cohort with species abundance information for a large number of samples and genome sequences of the corresponding bacterial species for metabolic modeling. However, we can use strains that have been isolated from C. elegans and its environment as well as artificial minimal C. elegans communities to approximate the frequency of unique uptake compounds in the C. elegans microbiota. Thus, within a sample of 78 bacterial species isolated from C. elegans and its environment, we usually only identified 3–5% of species with unique uptake compounds in communities comprising 30 or more bacterial species, which is the typical size of bacterial communities observed in C. elegans-derived microbiome samples (55) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in the artificial CeMbio C. elegans model microbiome community unique uptake compounds could usually only be detected for subsets of bacterial species up to a size of six member species (Fig. 1C). Fig 1. Open in a new tab Frequency of species with unique uptake compounds in microbiomes. Fraction of species with unique uptake compounds in (A) human gut bacterial communities and in (B and C) C. elegans bacterial communities that are subsets of previously reported C. elegans microbiome member species.Thus, in a typical microbiome like those analyzed above, we would expect to be able to identify unique uptake compounds only for a minority of bacterial species and compounds to target specific bacterial species are typically expected to be consumed by several species. Thus, for our identification of precision prebiotics for MYb11, we first excluded 20 compounds from our search that could specifically be taken up only by MYb11 in the search for a MYb-targeted prebiotic (20 compounds, see Table S2). Of note, MYb11 and MYb71 share the vast majority of all uptake compounds (85%), while only 10% and 5% of all uptake compounds are unique to MYb11 and MYb71, respectively (Fig. 2A). Fig 2.

Missing circles indicate compounds not tested by Biolog plates.Computational identification of precision prebiotics targeting P. lurida MYb11 In order to derive precision prebiotics for P. lurida MYb11, we used its metabolic network as input for flux balance analysis and two distinct community modeling approaches apart from the basic approach of FBA. The first one is based on BacArena that incorporates an individual-based modeling approach and the other one is so-called community FBA implemented in MicrobiomeGS2. These two modeling approaches differ in their underlying assumptions. In BacArena the two bacteria are modeled by their individual metabolic networks and fluxes are predicted by maximizing the biomass fluxes of individual bacteria. In community FBA, in turn, the metabolic networks of the individual bacterial species are merged into a community model for which the sum of biomass fluxes of both bacterial species is maximized. Thus, when using BacArena, metabolic interactions between species typically arise from one species secreting an end-product that another species can metabolize. In community FBA, in turn, the optimization of total growth assumes that bacterial species coordinate their metabolic fluxes so that overall growth is maximized. Thus, since we do not know to which extent MYb11 and MYb71 mutually interact with each other, we cover both ends of the spectrum of potential interactions between species from completely individually optimized behavior in BacArena to an absolute coordination of fluxes to maximize overall community growth. Using FBA, we identified 29 compounds that could increase the growth of MYb11 in single growth. Employing the community modeling approaches, we identified 81 compounds that increased the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 in community FBA and 17 compounds using BacArena (Fig. 2D). In order to determine whether specific compound classes were enriched among the MYb11-supporting compounds, we performed an enrichment based on HMDB annotation (46) across the three different simulation types. We found that growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 were enriched for fatty acids (Fisher’s exact test P value = 3.16 × 10−5). Interestingly, the growth dynamics of the models when they were part of a community model (Fig. 2B) differ from the growth dynamics of the models when they were treated as individual organisms (Fig. 2C). For instance, MYb71’s biomass flux was much higher in the community model, i.e., when coupled to the model MYb11. This is a typical observation when using community FBA when the biomass of the entire community is maximized. Especially for small communities, this often leads to one community member that most efficiently turns the growth medium into biomass to grow strongest with only little growth for other community members. On the other hand, in the BacArena simulations, we observed that most of those compounds boosted the growth of both species in single growth, however, the effect was larger for MYb11 than MYb71 (Fig. 2C). While BacArena also uses FBA to simulate bacterial growth, only a subset of FBA-predicted compounds that increase the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 was actually also identified by the BacArena approach (17 out of 29). The likely reason is that the FBA approach does not take into account potential interactions between species and that BacArena incorporates a stochastic component, for instance, for determining positioning as well as movement of bacteria and cellular replication events, such that small differences in growth rate between bacterial species might be filtered out by these stochastic events. Of the identified compounds, 17 compounds were shared across the three simulations. For eight of these, also information on uptake by MYb11 was available from Biolog plates which confirmed that MYb11 was able to consume them (24, 27) (Fig. 2D). Thus, combining modeling approaches and cross-referencing data from Biolog plates allowed us to considerably reduce our list of candidates to test experimentally to those giving the most consistent results. Based on the available literature information on the role of these compounds in longevity of the host (56, 57) or physiology (58), as nutritional compounds (24, 59), or compounds that are involved in host-microbial interactions (58, 60), we selected four candidates for further experimental testing as precision prebiotics to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. In vitro validation of predicted precision prebiotics As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested the ability of four of the predicted precision prebiotics compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, GABA, and D-mannitol, to specifically increase the growth of MYb11 in co-culture with MYb71. L-serine is a dietary amino acid that has been involved in nutrition-drug-host-microbial interactions (60) and can support the lifespan of the host (57), L-threonine, an essential amino acid (59), through its catabolite methylglyoxal (in low amounts) can also have a positive effect on host’s lifespan (56). GABA, apart from being a bacterial product, is protective for the host’s neurons (58). Finally, D-mannitol is a commonly used sugar alcohol (24), therefore its usage as a nutritional compound would make its usage as a supplement a safe option for the host. We supplemented MYb11 and MYb71 in mono- as well as co-culture and measured bacterial growth in vitro in liquid NGM after 5 h (Fig. S1) and 24 h. Independently of the added supplement or the mono- or co-culturing, MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased growth in mono- and co-cultures when supplemented with 10 mM L-serine, L-threonine, GABA, as well as D-mannitol after 24 h (Fig. 3A; Tables S6 to S9). Additionally, to quantify bacterial growth, we used fluorescently labeled strains. CFU of mono- and co-culture were plated and counted after 24 h growth in liquid culture in the presence (10 mM) or absence (0 mM) of the four compounds L-serine (Fig. 3B; Table S10), L-threonine (Fig. 3C; Table S12), GABA (Fig. 3D; Table S13), and D-mannitol (Fig. 3E; Table S14). MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased colony numbers in mono-culture when supplemented with L-serine and L-threonine compared to no supplementation (Fig. 3B and C, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.001, P = 0.006, P = 0.007, P = 0.032, respectively). GABA supplementation led to an increase in the growth of MYb11 in mono-culture, but not MYb71 (Fig. 3D, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001, P = 0.922, respectively), while D-mannitol had no effect on the growth of MYb11 nor MYb71 in mono-culture (Fig. 3E, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.259, P = 0.661, respectively). Thus, while serine as well as threonine boosted growth of MYb11 in co-culture versus unsupplemented single growth, and mannitol as well as GABA did not change growth in co-culture versus unsupplemented single growth, all four compounds specifically promoted MYb11 growth in co-culture over MYb71 in vitro and thus confirmed the computational predictions (Fig. 3B through E, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 6.87E−06, P < 0.001, P = 7.15E−06, P = 7.07E−06, respectively) (see also: Table S11) Fig 3.

Shown are boxplots with the median as a thick horizontal line, the interquartile range as box, the outer quartiles as whiskers, and each replicate depicted by a dot. The CFU count data of every replicate was normalized by subtracting the median of the CFU count data from the corresponding non-supplemented control treatments (control and experimental data provided in the Tables S10, S12 to S14). Black asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented and non-supplemented median, gray asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented medians of MYb11 and MYb71. n = 5–14.Concentration-dependent effect of L-serine supplementation in vitro The statistical analyses suggested that L-serine is the most promising precision prebiotic for further analysis among the compounds validated in vitro. We repeated the in vitro supplementation experiment across a concentration gradient to determine the optimal dose for enrichment of MYb11. Overall, the MYb11 growth as well as MYb71 growth in monoculture at 10 and 100 mM over time were increased following the increase in L-serine concentrations (Fig. 4A; Table S15). When quantifying the growth with supplementation at the same concentration gradient (Fig. 4B; Table S16), then starting with 1 mM did not significantly impact the abundance of MYb11 proportions (GLM, P = 0.778), nor MYb71 (GLM, P = 0.69). However, supplementation with 10 mM led to an enrichment of MYb11 (GLM, P < 0.001), thereby indicating a significant difference in proportions in co-culture between MYb11 and MYb71 (GLM, P = 5.77E−07). Essentially identical results were obtained at 100 mM, including an MYb11 enrichment (GLM, P = 0.004), and a significant difference between MYb11 and MYb71 proportions (GLM, P = 7.93E−05). (See also: Table S17) Fig 4. Open in a new tab Concentration-dependent effect of L-serine supplementation on bacterial growth in vitro.

Black asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented and non-supplemented median, gray asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented medians of MYb11 and MYb71. n = 9–12.Serine supplementation alters bacterial colonization of C. elegans Finally, we tested whether L-serine supplementation to solid growth medium would alter bacterial proportions in the host C. elegans. Synchronized populations of L1 larvae were pipetted onto bacterial lawns of MYb11 and MYb71 on solid NGM plates supplemented with either 0, 10, or 100 mM L-serine. After 72 h, adult worms were collected to quantify bacterial proportions. Supplementation at 10 mM L-serine did not change the proportion of MYb11 in co-culture in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, P = 0.459, Fig. 5A left panel). However, L-serine supplementation at 100 mM increased the proportion of MYb11 in the bacterial community in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, P < 0.001, Fig. 5A, right panel). We next asked whether the effect of supplementation on bacterial proportions in the host simply reflected changes in the proportion of bacteria that were available to them on the lawn (i.e., their diet). The relative abundance of MYb11 on lawns did not change by 10 mM supplementation (GLM, P = 0.61, Fig. 5A, left panel) compared to non-supplementation. However, the relative abundance of MYb11 was approximately 60% in non-supplemented media and increased to approximately 75% with 100 mM L-serine supplementation (GLM, P < 0.002, Fig. 5B, right panel). The observed proportions of MYb11 in worms at 100 mM serine were significantly higher than expected based on proportions in the lawn and thus colonization probability compared to MYb71 (chi-squared test, Χ2 = 10.244, df = 1, P = 0.0013; see Materials and Methods). This suggests that the provision of serine enriches MYb11 in the host independently from the enrichment observed on the lawn and that serine allows MYb11 to overcome its growth disadvantages in competition with MYb71 in the host (see also: Table S18 and S19). Fig 5. Open in a new tab L-serine supplementation alters bacterial abundance in C. elegans. (A) Adult worms were collected from solid NGM plates, which had been inoculated with co-culture and supplemented with 10 mM L-serine (left panel) or 100 mM (right panel) L-serine. Worms were washed and surface-sterilized to remove residual bacteria, then homogenized in a buffer. Bacterial proportions were quantified based on colony counts. (B) Bacterial lawns were sampled by cutting an agar disc of standardized size from NGM plates supplemented with 10 mM (left panel) or 100 mM L-serine (right panel). Discs were homogenized in buffer, and CFUs were quantified. (A and B) Shown are boxplots with the median as a thick horizontal line, the interquartile range as box, the outer quartiles as whiskers, and each biological replicate depicted by a symbol. For each replicate and each bacterium, bacterial abundance from experimental treatments was normalized by subtracting the median of the corresponding non-supplemented controls (0 mM), as indicated by the dashed lines. Statistical differences were determined by GLM and are indicated by asterisks (*** P < 0.001, **P < 0.01) and show comparisons between supplemented and non-supplemented median.DISCUSSION Although many factors are known to influence microbiome composition [e.g., dietary patterns, lifestyle, or medication (61)], the mechanisms causing these changes are often not fully understood and often a large number of bacterial species are affected. We propose that the most effective way to modulate the composition of the microbiome is by modulating or enriching the abundance of an already existing bacterial species with health-beneficial effects using precision prebiotics. A direct approach to identify such precision prebiotics would be to provide compounds that are uniquely taken up by the bacterial target species. However, through an analysis of C. elegans and human microbiome data, we were able to show that such unique uptake compounds typically only exist for few species in a microbial community and especially for larger communities there are no such compounds at all. Thus, in a typical microbiome, precision prebiotics have to be identified from compounds that are potentially taken up by several species. To identify such compounds, we used genome-scale metabolic networks of two bacterial members from the C. elegans microbiome, O. vermis MYb71, and the host-protective P. lurida MYb11, in conjunction with constraint-based modeling to identify compounds that specifically increased the growth of MYb11. Using HMDB annotation (46), we found that fatty acids were enriched as predicted growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 which is in agreement with previous observations of the preference of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas for these compounds (62). Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross-referencing with Biolog data revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, D-mannitol, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol-3-phosphate, L-serine, trehalose, L-threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. We experimentally tested four of these predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and GABA in vitro and confirmed their positive effect specifically on the growth of MYb11. Moving into the C. elegans host system, we were able to show that L-serine is also able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 in vivo, when the host was colonized with both bacterial species. Interestingly, while 10 mM of L-serine was sufficient for an enrichment of MYb11 in batch culture, 100 mM was necessary in the growth experiments with the host. This suggests differences in either bacterial uptake kinetics for L-serine or bacterial growth in general between batch growth and growth on agar plates. Moreover, while MYb11 was strongly enriched in worms to similar levels like MYb71 even though it had a very low abundance in the lawn, this enrichment was even stronger when supplying L-serine. Thus, our proof-of-principle work demonstrates that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics. The effect of serine and threonine on the host and/or on its microbiome has been also documented in the literature. For instance, threonine is an essential amino acid for the host (59). Longevity effects on the host have been shown also after supplementation with threonine (63) and serine (57), while dietary serine reduced host fitness through acting on bacterial metabolism, when it was supplemented along with the chemotherapeutic 5-fluoro 2′deoxyuridine (60). Moreover, serine promotes the growth of E. coli LF82 in the mouse gut (64), which shows the potential of this compound to alter the abundance of multiple species. In accordance, we also observed the effects of serine on MYb71 growth, which was, however, stronger for MYb11 if they were grown in community. One important challenge to specifically target the microbiome with nutritional supplements is to prevent host uptake or metabolization of the supplements (65). Different approaches to achieve restricted bioavailability, such as the supplementation of non-digestible carbohydrates (66) or coating of supplements with compounds that dissolve during passage through the digestive tract have been developed (67–69). Moreover, as indicated by our analysis of concentration-dependent effects of supplementation in the case of serine, it might be necessary to control the specific concentrations of a compound that are being released and their stability over time in the gut. From the bacterial side, Biolog assays have shown that MYb11 has the capacity to catabolize serine (Fig. 2D). However, the specific concentrations used on the Biolog plates and the mechanisms of transport that are possibly dependent on those concentrations are not known. From the host side, to maintain relatively constant concentrations in the host environment or to deviate from its normal concentrations, advanced formulations such as nanotechnology (70), delayed release, and other drug delivery technologies (71, 72) could be employed. Although our combined computational-experimental approach can serve as a blueprint for future studies aimed at the identification of precision prebiotics, several factors should still be taken into consideration. As we showed, it is nearly impossible to identify a compound that is uniquely taken up by only one species within a community. This point becomes apparent, if we consider the numerous different species that reside in various hosts. For instance, the synthetic bacterial community of C. elegans, CeMbio (24) has 12 members, while the human-related bacterial community AGORA has more than 800 species (34). Thus, an important next step is to scale up our approach to more complex communities. Also along these lines, we did use automatically reconstructed bacterial metabolic networks from our gapseq approach rather than manually curated networks which resembles the typical situation in the human gut microbiota where a detailed manual reconstruction of the hundreds to thousands of already detected and sequenced bacterial species is practically impossible. Furthermore, since the physiology of worms cannot be directly compared to the physiology of humans, the efficacy and effectiveness of the approach [see more on the topic (73)] need to be studied in more detail. At this point, the complexity of the regulatory affairs in various jurisdictions (e.g., the definition of nutritional supplementation vs medication, safety concerns) should also not be underestimated (74). Additionally, while the modeling approach we used has quite a number of underlying assumptions, it allowed us to considerably narrow down the list of potential candidate metabolites for experimental testing. Finally, we did not consider potential side effects of the supplemented metabolites on the worm host and did not optimize the mode of delivery, for instance, to release the supplement specifically in the worm gut, which are important considerations for future studies. Taking everything into consideration, we showed that the in silico design of targeted supplementation strategies to modulate the microbiome is not only feasible but also promising for the development of future microbiome-based treatment.Supplementary Material Reviewer comments reviewer-comments.pdf (123.6KB, pdf) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation within the collaborative research center “Origin and Function of Metaorganisms,” CRC1182, sub-project A1 to C.K., K.D., and H.S.; the research unit miTarget (FOR5042) to C.K. and the excellence cluster “Precision medicine in chronic inflammation” (EXC2167) to C.K. and H.S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.Conclusion Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.Subject terms: Systems biology, Skin diseases",
    "introduction": "Introduction Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions. As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17. In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions.",

The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values. No ethical approval for this manuscript was required to use the JAXA astronaut data since this was publicly available data on the GeneLab platform. In addition the data made available on GeneLab was only provided as anonymized aggregate data. GeneLab spaceflight murine datasets Five RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-238, OSD-239, OSD-240, OSD-241, OSD-254) were downloaded from the NASA OSDR via the API, and full dataset descriptions can be found on the dataset pages. These datasets are derived from whole murine skin samples from the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments. For MHU-2, singly-housed male C57BL/6J mice were 9 weeks of age when flown on the ISS for 30 days; they were euthanized less than 1 day after return to Earth. Dorsal and femoral skin samples were extracted from MHU-2 mice, and 6 replicates in spaceflight microgravity and the matching 6 replicates in the 1G ground control were split into 2 sets of 3, with half fed a JAXA chow diet and the other half fed JAXA chow with supplemental FOS18. For RR-5, 30 week old BALB/c mice in shared housing were flown on the ISS for 30 days; following return to Earth, mice were given 30 days to recover before euthanasia and extraction of dorsal and femoral skin tissue. Finally, for RR-7, 11 week old C57BL/6J mice and C3H/HeJ mice were flown on the ISS for either 25 or 75 days before being euthanized on-orbit. RNA-Seq analysis of rodent datasets Raw counts data, derived via a previously reported pipeline20, were downloaded from the NASA OSDR and loaded with tximport (v1.28.0). ERCC genes were filtered out, as were genes with zero counts in the minimum number of samples corresponding to a single condition. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the Wald significance test was performed on spaceflight microgravity and ground control samples using the R package DESeq221 (v1.40.2). For each data subset, microgravity spaceflight samples were contrasted with ground control samples and cook’s cut off and independent filtering were not used. Mapping of mouse ENSEMBL gene IDs to gene symbols and human orthologs was done using the R Package biomaRt (v2.56.1) and ENSEMBL 105. For human orthologs, one-to-many mapping was supported. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All DGE statistics for the rodent data, including the list of cross-mission genes, can be found in Supplementary Data 1. Pathway analysis of rodent datasets For Over Representation Analysis (ORA), the R package clusterProfiler (v4.8.3) was used on vectors of genes and bar plots were made via ggplot2 (v3.4.4). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the R package FGSEA (v1.26.0) was used. GSEA was performed on all DEGs for all data subsets, with rank vectors consisting of HGNC symbols and corresponding sorted t-scores in the data subset. MSigDB human collections H, C2, and C5 were used (v7.4) and set sizes >15 were permitted. For the mitochondrial pathway analysis, human pathways from MitoPathways (v3.0), with some additional custom curated pathways (Supplementary Table 1), were used and set sizes >1 were permitted. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All GSEA results, including mitochondrial results, can be found in Supplementary Data 2. RNA-Seq data analysis on Twin Study samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the ISS and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for a total of 19 time points for the flight subject and 13 time points for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation and processing see ref. 19. Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80 °C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4 °C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 h including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per19 using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits. As previously reported19, generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto22 on ENSEMBL transcripts. Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq221 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells20,23. Reads were mapped onto an updated reference genome (GRCh38)24. JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through the NASA OSDR with accession number: OSD-53025. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. In total 2-3 pre-flight samples (L-168 ± 14 days, L-112 ± 14 days, L-56 ± 14 days), 4 in-flight samples (L + 5 ± 1 day, L + 30 ± 7 days, L + 60 ± 14 days, L + 120 ± 14d or R-8 (−14d/+0d day)), and 3-4 post-flight samples (R + 3 ± 1 day, R + 30 ± 7 days, R + 60 ± 14 days, R + 120 ± 14 days) were collected per astronaut. As provided by OSDR, data points for all subjects were pooled into one group per mission phase. JAXA astronaut hair follicle data Gene expression data from 10 JAXA astronauts’ hair follicles13 was downloaded from the NASA OSDR (OSD-174). Raw data for 60 total samples was processed using LIMMA with R/bioconductor26. Briefly, duplicate sample single-color Agilent microarray data was background corrected, filtered for low expression probes, and quantile normalized. Differential gene expression was measured between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight data points using p-values adjusted for False Discovery Rates (FDR) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. As previously described13 hair follicle samples were collected from each astronaut on 6-month ISS missions at two pre-flight time points (firstly between L-180 and L-90, and secondly between L-60 and L-14), two in-flight time points (firstly between L + 20 and L + 37, and secondly between R-20 and R-7), and two post-flight time points (firstly between R + 2 and R + 7, and secondly between R + 30 and R + 90). Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre- and post-flight, and will be accessible via the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)27. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference28. Reads were mapped onto a recent reference genome (GRCh38)24. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported [Ref. 29]. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). As previously described in detail17, these biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. Based on staining images using fluorescent antibodies, a total of 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) were profiled across outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. The IE and OE regions represented stratum basale, and stratum spinosum with stratum granulosum, respectively. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform DGE analysis. Records of vitamin D supplement consumption were not available for the i4 crew. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). Astronaut physiological data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006-2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. These missions were 4–6 months in length, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return + 0, R + 0) and again 30-d later (R + 30). The R + 0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 h after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 h after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre- and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described30. We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as previously reported31. As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p < 0.001 are reported. The data was plotted using R package ggplot2 (v3.3.5). QLattice symbolic regression modeling We used symbolic regression (QLattice v3.0.132) to construct models involving combinations of synergistic genes which map from the gene expressions to spaceflight status. For these models, we only distinguish between mice that went to space and mice that did not. Conventional statistical methods typically allow for calculating the effect of a single gene at a time through metrics such as p-values and false discovery rates. In contrast, symbolic regression models can reveal combinations of genes and modules that best predict spaceflight status. These could be linear combinations involving two or more genes that have previously also been shown to be statistically significant, or it could be non-linear combinations that reveal features that on their own were non-significant but in synergy with a second feature become highly predictive. In addition, known biological functions of genes included in models, as well as the resultant mathematical relationship between them, can potentially be interpreted to reveal regulations or interactions that are affected by spaceflight. In biological pathway analysis, it is well-known that up- or down-regulation of one gene can have cascading effects, such that the function of one gene becomes sensitive to that of another33. It has previously been demonstrated that parsimonious machine learning models are able to provide accurate outcome prediction in omics data, while preserving interpretability34,35. The interpretability often results from the fact that models might demonstrate otherwise opaque relations, which become clear when combined effects are considered. An example could be an interaction where the regulation of a single gene is itself unimportant for functional changes, unless another gene is simultaneously regulated. This would indicate a synergistic compound effect, which naturally can expand to a 3-, 4- or 5-gene synergy and beyond. The combined effect of two or more individually insignificant gene expression levels may thus theoretically be more powerful than the effect of a single gene with low p-value. Thus, traditional statistical analysis masks such effects by the use of metrics related to the individual gene. UMAP dimensional reduction and gene clustering For the clustering of genes shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a uniqueness filtering by first dropping all genes where more than a quarter of the samples had identical expression levels. Subsequently, we filtered out all genes with a variance of less than 1.7, resulting in 2184 filtered genes with high variability. Fig. 1. Global data overview. Open in a new tab a Breakdown of the rodent datasets used in this study. b Clustering of the most variable genes within the rodent datasets with functional annotation.A dimensional reduction was performed subsequent to filtering by uniformly distributing the filtered data on a Riemannian manifold, using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). UMAP is a general purpose manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm which is similar to t-SNE in that it predominantly preserves local structure. Yet, UMAP preserves more global structure, which makes it a more suited algorithm when the objective of the dimensional reduction is more than simple visualization (in this case the objective is clustering). Genes were then clustered using the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)36. A primary advantage of HDBSCAN is that it is always deterministic for the same hyperparameters, and will thus always return the same clustering, all else being equal. In addition, comparable clustering algorithms such as k-means do not perform well unless clusters are of equal size and density with few outliers. With biological data such as gene expressions, we expect large variation in cluster size and density, making HDBSCAN the ideal choice. Once genes were clustered, the gene sets belonging to each cluster were extracted and analyzed using three ontology databases in the Python implementation, GSEAPY, of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis37 tool Enrichr38. We used the Elsevier Pathway Collection, the 2021 WikiPathway Collection, and the 2021 MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 4 Collection. These enrichment analyses were used to provide context to each cluster by appending an annotation if a notable amount of hits showed up for a particular association. Regulatory network analysis We used the differential gene expression data from all cross-mission genes across each comparison to perform an upstream regulator analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-0139). We identified the biological or chemical drugs in the QIAGEN IPA library of regulators, defined as having a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 and an absolute Z-score >1. Drugs from the dataset that met these criteria and were associated with similar log2 fold-change patterns in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were visualized by hierarchical clustering of the unstandardized Z-scores using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric, and complete-linkage method for agglomeration. Statistics on the full list of drug targets can be found in Supplementary Data 3.

    "results": "Results Spaceflight transcriptome global changes in rodent skin reflect common biological hallmarks of spaceflight To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates. These datasets are derived from three different spaceflight missions (Fig. 1a). The most variable genes across the datasets cluster into functional groups related to established physiological risks of spaceflight (Fig. 1b). For example, spaceflight is known to induce immune dysfunction1 and Cluster 1 involves highly-correlated genes associated with immune response, including genes linked to modulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Microgravity is also well established to cause degradation of muscle1, and Cluster 9 contains a significant number of genes related to muscular morphology and muscle disorders. Ionizing radiation is known to cause renal and pulmonary fibrosis41,42 and profibrosis-like alterations were previously observed in lung tissue of mice returned from Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118)43. Renal and lung fibrosis associated genes found in Cluster 7, and genes encoding proteins involved in sclerotic diseases grouped in Cluster 8, further supports these reports. Upon subsetting each dataset based on experimental groups (i.e. diet, strain, skin site) and performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis for spaceflight samples versus ground control samples, we end up with 10 data subsets (Fig. 2a). In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.1) in at least 2 out of the 10 data subsets. One significant DEG shared across data subsets from the RR-7 study is GLYCAM1 which is shared between both data subsets for the C57BL/6 J strain. GLYCAM1, a ligand for L-selectin that has been proposed to modulate leukocyte transendothelial migration from blood44, is strongly upregulated (Log2 Fold Change (LFC) ≈ 18.81, FDR < 10−6) at the 25 day time point and strongly downregulated (LFC ≈ −15.66, FDR < 0.002) at the 75 day time point, which could indicate a relationship between spaceflight duration and immune alterations for the C57BL/6J mice. Over representation analysis (ORA) reveals that a large proportion of the 244 significant DEGs shared between MHU-2 data subsets are associated with the organization of collagen and the ECM (Fig. 2b). Significant modulation of genes associated with ECM homeostasis was previously reported in analyses of the skin of space flown mice11,12. The MHU-2 subset from the dorsal skin of mice fed a standard JAXA chow diet with supplemental prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) contains the highest quantity of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) DEGs by a substantial margin (Fig. 2a). In ground-based rodent studies, FOS has been shown to improve gut microbiome balance, increase bone density, and affect the immune system through increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (modifying interleukin production and natural killer cell activity), and modification of the immune system via gut-associated lymphoid tissue18,45. Due to the disparity between the number of significant DEGs in the data subsets, and the variety of conditions between data subsets, care must be taken when combining these data subsets to infer shared responses of rodent skin to spaceflight. Fig. 2. Differentially expressed genes shared between datasets. Open in a new tab a An upset plot showing the number of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight versus ground data subsets and the number of overlapping significant DEGs between these data subsets. The colored annotation bar on the left of the plot shows how the original datasets divide into 10 data subsets based on all unique conditions including diet, biological sex and strain. The bar plot on the right of the upset plot shows the number of significant DEGs in each of the 10 data subsets. The bar plot on the top shows the number of intersecting DEGs between combinations of the data subsets, as indicated by the connected dots within the body of the upset plot. Black connecting lines indicate combinations spanning across multiple missions, and other connecting lines are colored according to the annotation bar, based on their shared mission. b A bar plot of significant Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) pathways from significant DEGs shared by any subsets within the MHU-2 mission (i.e., DEGs from the blue bars in panel a). Genes significantly altered in rodent skin spaceflight response across multiple missions are associated with cell cycle processes To address the previously mentioned bias in the MHU-2 dorsal skin data subset with a FOS-supplemented diet, and to delineate the common response of murine skin to spaceflight across multiple datasets, a list of 189 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) is generated exhibiting significance (False Discovery Rate ≤0.1) in data subsets from at least two distinct missions. For the majority of the significant DEGs, there is a trend of downregulation in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Supplementary Fig. 1). A smaller cluster of genes (e.g., LAMA1, S1PR1, HMGCS2, TXNIP, IGFBP3, ADGRF5, CAR4, HSD17B11, C1QTNF9, KLF11) are also significant in those same data subsets, but are significantly upregulated (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Cross-mission genes involved in rodent skin spaceflight response. Open in a new tab a A heatmap showing regulatory changes of select cross-mission genes (genes that are significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed between flight and ground control across multiple missions) within each rodent data subset. b A bar plot showing the GOBP pathways that the full list of cross-mission genes are involved in. c A decision boundary plot of the strongest cross-mission QLattice model using only the expression of two genes as input features to predict the spaceflight status of the all mice in the data. d A decision boundary plot of the second-strongest model across all missions.To go beyond single-gene significance, we use QLattice modeling32 to construct models that predict the spaceflight status of all samples in the data (i.e. from all data subsets). These models use the expression of two genes at most to arrive at maximally relevant and minimally redundant models. In Fig. 3c, d, we show the decision boundaries of the two strongest models found, with Area Under Curve (AUC) scores of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. Both models show that the spaceflight status is well separated using only the expression of two genes as input, while also having plausible biological interpretations, which we discuss in the following sections. The 189 cross-mission DEGs are primarily involved in cell-cycle pathways (Fig. 3b), with several of the genes (e.g. LAMA1, C1QTNF9, HMGCS2, TXNIP, KLF11) clustering with average trends of upregulation across the datasets (Fig. 3a). Spaceflight is well-documented to perturb the cell-cycle1. These genes tend also to be involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with diabetes; HMGCS2 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation46, while LAMA1 and KLF11 variations have been shown to be risk factors in type 2 diabetes47,48. Aside from being a protector against oxidative stress, TXNIP is similarly implicated in metabolic diseases, and is typically upregulated in diabetic and prediabetic muscle tissue49. C1QTNF9 (also known as CTRP9) has also emerged as a potentially important component of pathways involving lipid metabolism and adipose tissue, exemplified by the fact that C1QTNF9 transgenic mice have been shown to resist weight gain and metabolic dysfunction50. It is interesting to note that upregulation of these metabolic pathway genes appears generally weaker for female mice. This might be linked to the same mechanisms offering higher protection for females against diet-induced obesity compared to male mice, as has been noted in other studies51. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) axis have been implicated in pathogenesis of both inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases and also plays a role in skin’s immune response to viral infection52. In both MHU-2 and RR-7 missions S1PR1 is enriched, while this effect is reversed in RR-5 after 30-day recovery (Fig. 3a). On the contrary FLG (Filaggrin), CASP14, KRT2, genes involved in cornified envelope and skin barrier formation36–38,53–55, generally showed an opposite trend in gene expression patterns (Fig. 3a). CASP14 is also the main driver of the second-most predictive 2-gene QLattice model obtained from the cross-mission key gene list, which involved a combined model of CASP14 and S1PR1 (Fig. 3d). OXTR, identified as a key driver in the most predictive 2-gene QLattice model derived from the cross-mission key gene list, along with SLC6A18 (Fig. 3c), is predominantly localized in the basal layer of the epidermis. Its primary expression is attributed to keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts56. OXTR together with oxytocin has been shown to mediate oxidative stress response in the skin56. Our analysis revealed an increase in gene expression of OXTR across all missions and experimental conditions except for C3H/Hej mice in the RR-7 mission at the 25-day time point (Fig. 3a). Both estrogens and androgens play an important role in skin and hair physiology. HSD17B11, which has a stronger expression in steroidogenic cells such as sebaceous glands, has been predicted to be involved in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis, and conversion 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to androsterone57. Similar to the pattern observed in OXTR, HSD17B11 expression was increased in all murine datasets except for RR-5 dorsal skin group (Fig. 3a). Astronaut data correlates with select gene expression changes occurring across missions in the murine skin models Having investigated a set of cross-mission genes regulated by spaceflight in rodent skin, we then decided to investigate the expression of human orthologs of these genes in astronaut studies. Firstly, we use post-flight vs pre-flight gene expression data from skin samples collected during the i4 mission. Similar to the patterns observed in murine models (Fig. 3a), FLG and CASP14, which play significant roles in skin barrier formation, are also downregulated in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 4a), where they are primarily expressed. In the literature, FLG is reported to mainly be expressed in stratum granulosum58, with mutations associated with dry skin, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis as well as ichthyosis vulgaris54,59,60. CASP14 on the other hand is known to be primarily expressed in differentiating and cornifying layers44 and decreased levels were detected in lesional skin biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis61,62. Likewise, KRT2 which was downregulated across all subgroups in the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions (Fig. 3a), was also downregulated in the skin of i4 astronauts, with strongest downregulation in outer epidermis where it is primarily expressed but also in inner epidermis and outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Additionally, similarly to the trend of upregulation in the rodent data (Fig. 3a), OXTR is upregulated across all compartments studied in the i4 skin (Fig. 4a) and HSD17B11 is upregulated in both compartments of the epidermis and in the outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. The profile of the cross-mission genes in astronauts. Open in a new tab a Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. b Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In some astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight, decrease in melanin content has been previously reported63. In the inner epidermis of the i4 skin data, where melanin synthesis takes place, we found downregulation of two genes associated with melanin biosynthesis, TYRP1 and DCT64 (Fig. 4a). However, TYR which synthesizes tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis was upregulated in the same compartment65 (Fig. 4a). TYR, DCT, and TYRP1 clustered in the rodent data, with an average trend of downregulation, particularly in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Fig. 3a). We also analyze gene expression data from the blood of astronauts from the NASA Twins, JAXA CFE studies, and i4 studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the NASA Twins Study, the most noteworthy results are in CD4 cell type in-flight vs pre-flight samples with significant downregulation in a group of genes (e.g. DSC2, TMEM252, CEBPD, CA4, and PTGS2, and OTX1) persisting post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These genes display no significant changes in CD8 cells, which may indicate that their downregulation is a response to immune system stressors affecting the helper function and signaling of CD4 cells. DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), STIL and TOP2A cell-cycle associated genes are amongst the most strongly upregulated genes in-flight compared to pre-flight in the CD8 cells, and exhibit downregulation post-flight to trend towards pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In the CFE study, several genes were strongly upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight (e.g., OXTR, PRR9, ERCC6L) in the blood samples from JAXA astronauts (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In the i4 mission blood samples the majority of genes show a pronounced suppression in the time point immediately before flight, which could be indicative of increased stress prior to launch. Several genes then show strong upregulation at the first post-flight time point (e.g., BARD1, BRCA1, RAD54B, EXO1, OXTR, and HSD17B11) (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting upregulation due to spaceflight or landing stressors, followed by post-flight recovery towards baseline expression levels from second post-flight time point and beyond. However, some other genes appear to show a delayed upregulation following spaceflight, as they are upregulated in the second post-flight time point, two months after flight (e.g. KLF11, CA4, OXT1, TM4SF4) and return towards baseline at the third post-flight time point (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gene expression alterations in these sets of genes are potentially due to a re-adaptation response. Specific pathways and genes related to skin health are altered in spaceflight To determine direct relevance of spaceflight to skin health, we conduct targeted analysis with a curated list of key pathways involved in skin health from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and identify which of these pathways and associated genes are significantly modulated in the murine skin datasets. A collagen biosynthesis pathway and a set of collagen genes (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) suppressed/downregulated across all dataset subsets for the MHU-2 mission, while showing a trend of weak enrichment/upregulation across the two other missions (Fig. 5a). Additionally, several collagen and/or ECM related genes (e.g., MMP3, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL15A1, COL6A3, SPARC, PCOLCE, and PYCR1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) downregulated in all of the MHU-2 data subsets except femoral skin with the standard diet, and a few collagen related genes were significantly downregulated only in the dorsal subsets from the MHU-2 mission (e.g., P3H1, CRTAP, COL14A1, and FKBP14) (Fig. 5a). Overall, the distinct collagen/ECM downregulation signature (Fig. 5a) suggests that a study design difference in the MHU-2 mission (compared to the RR-5 and RR-7 missions), where the use of young single-housed male mice or dissection shortly after the hypergravity event of Live Animal Return (LAR) may have suppressed collagen biosynthesis. Similarly, we find an overall trend of enrichment of pathways relating to thin skin and dermal atrophy in the RR-5 and RR-7 mice, with suppression occurring in the MHU-2 mice (Fig. 5a), likely driven by regulatory patterns in the collagen-associated genes. While there is a general trend of upregulation, the RR-5 mission generally lacks any significant results for genes relating to skin health, which could be due to the 30 days of recovery post-flight. In addition to being reported as cross-mission genes in the previous section, CASP14, FLG and KRT2 were also identified as key skin health genes (Fig. 5). Fig. 5.

MMP3, which induces accelerated loss of skin collagen when there is inflammation, was upregulated across the whole dermal layer65 (Fig. 5b). Likewise, several genes (e.g., P3H1, COL14A1, COL15A1, and COLA12A1) were upregulated in both compartments of the dermis (Fig. 5b). KRT24, involved in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, is reported to be mainly confined to stratum spinosum with slight overexpression in senescent keratinocytes49 and has been shown to induce apoptosis of keratinocytes66. In the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 skin data KRT24 is upregulated in all compartments of the skin with a more prominent increase in outer epidermis and vascular layers66 (Fig. 5b). Late cornified envelope genes (LCE) are located in the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1 and in the skin their expression is known to be mainly confined to the epidermis, specifically to upper stratum granulosum and premature cornified envelopes67,68. In both the inner epidermis and outer dermis of the i4 skin data, LCE2A, LCE2B, LCE2C, LCE2D, genes that respond to UV and calcium67 and LCE5A were upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight (Fig. 5b). In the NASA Twins study blood samples, COL6A2 was upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight in CD8 cells, with PYCR1 following the same pattern in CD4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the CFE study, blood samples from JAXA astronauts had strong in-flight upregulation of RPTN and COL3A1, and in particular LCE2B, where upregulation increased further post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). On the other hand, PYCR1 and GJB6 showed the opposite trend in gene expression, with strong downregulation in-flight and almost complete reversal upon return (Supplementary Fig. 3b). PYCR1, which was upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight in all skin layers of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b) encodes pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in proline synthesis via utilization of NADH or NADPH. Proline plays an important role in collagen synthesis and PYCR1 deficiency results in collagen and elastin abnormalities69. Conversely, COL3A1 encodes alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, which is an EMP synthesized in cells as pre-collagen and its accumulation was shown to cause fibrosis in various organs70,71. In case of LCE2C and KRT33A, weak in-flight downregulation was followed by strong post-flight upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Although less apparent, this trend for KRT33A was also observed in the JAXA HAIR data (Fig. 5c). KRT33A, one of the type 1 hair keratin genes, is known to be highly expressed in the cortex of hair follicles, and its expression is reported to decrease with age72. Lastly, genes such as COL6A2 and FKBP14, a collagen/ECM related gene associated with diseases such as kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, hearing impairment, muscle hypotonia and occasional vascular fragility like aortic rupture73, were downregulated in-flight and their average expression persisted post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Radiosensitivity of mouse strains impacts DNA damage response in the skin following spaceflight As part of our targeted analysis, we also opted to investigate the modulation of DNA damage and repair pathways in rodent skin. DNA damage and repair is a well-established response to space radiation19,74 and little research is reported on the consequences this will have on the skin during spaceflight. When ionizing radiation hits DNA molecules, single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, with DDR mechanisms activated to repair these breaks74. For the majority of DNA damage and repair pathways, both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets (Fig. 6). In these three data subsets, pathways relating to DNA damage and repair are generally enriched, while being suppressed in other data subsets. BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice, as used in these data subsets, have been shown to be more radiosensitive compared to C57BL/6J mice75–77, so repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate increased radiation-induced DNA damage. In the C3H/HeJ mice there is a trend of decreasing activity for the DDR pathways from the 25-day to 75-day time points which could indicate either adaptation of the DNA repair pathways over time in space or dysregulation following extended-duration spaceflight (Fig. 6). The enrichment of DDR pathways in RR-5 also follows 30-days of spaceflight and a post-flight recovery period of 30-days (Fig. 6). However, DNA repair genes were reported to still be enriched compared to pre-flight levels when evaluated at 6-months post-flight during the NASA Twins study19, so persistent DDR activation during post-flight recovery in the mice could be indicative of a similar mechanism. Fig. 6. DNA damage and repair pathways being regulated in rodents flown to space. Open in a new tab Heatmap of pathways relating to DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (full list Supplementary Table 1), significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one data subset. Mitochondrial dysregulation increased in the skin during spaceflight Mitochondrial stress has been identified as a key hub for spaceflight response in multi-tissue analysis, yet skin was not included78. Skin is a tissue with high turnover and energy requirements79, so we decided to investigate spaceflight changes relating to mitochondrial stress in murine skin. We find that spaceflight alters mitochondrial pathways in the skin (Fig. 7a), as previously observed in other tissues and across species78. Enrichment of an integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in all but two of the dataset subsets (Fig. 7a) is consistent with a previous report of potentially activated ISR due to mitochondrial dysfunction in space flown mice78. Interestingly, the two data subsets where ISR appeared to instead be suppressed were the 25 day time points for both strains from the RR-7 mission (Fig. 7a), implicating spaceflight duration as an important factor for modulating ISR. Additionally, we ran the QLattice machine learning model on the full gene set to obtain a set of models that were unbiased by feature selection due to e.g. variance filtering and the selection of cross-mission genes. One of the 10 strongest 2-feature models involved the expression of the genes D2HGDH (D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase)80 and RPLP0-PS1 (a gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPLP0). The model’s decision boundary (Fig. 7b) demonstrates how the simultaneous upregulation of D2HGDH and downregulation of RPLP0-PS1 characterizes the space-flown mice, with a resulting AUC score of 0.8280. The upregulation of D2HGDH generally indicates an increased ability to break down the toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) compound in the mitochondria. In our case, this could be a compensatory mechanism due to larger build-up of the compound, and the model suggests that this is further dependent on the abundance of the RPLP0 protein. Fig. 7. Mitochondrial specific analysis on rodent spaceflight skin tissue. Open in a new tab a Heatmap of pathways relating to the mitochondria, significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least 1 data subset. b Decision boundary for the 2-gene model related to mitochondrial changes. The model indicates an increased removal of the toxic D2H compound in mitochondria through upregulation of D2HGDH, which is less pronounced when PPP1R3B expression is suppressed. Circulating physiological markers from astronauts indicate that exercise countermeasures may have improved skin health We investigate standard physiological biomarkers collected from astronaut urine and blood81,82 to see whether average trends in these biomarkers connect to spaceflight gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin (Fig. 8). In-flight increases in IGF-1, leptin and white blood cell levels may indicate altered stress response due to spaceflight. Following a hypothesis that improved countermeasures may improve skin physiological parameters in astronauts on the ISS14,15, we split the data into astronauts that used the older Interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), and astronauts that used the newer Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Notably, overlapping data to that shown in Fig. 8 have been used as evidence of improvements in parameters relating to bone mineral density81. Indeed, while vitamin D decreased in-flight and normalized upon return to Earth for both exercise devices, ARED appeared to reduce this drop. Vitamin D is well-established to be an important mediator of skin health83. Notably, this decrease in vitamin D is observed despite consistent programmatic vitamin D supplementation since the collection of blood samples81. Fig. 8.

Spaceflight-induced gene regulatory changes in the skin correlate with relevant drug responses Having established a list of genes that changed in the rodent skin across multiple missions, we then investigate potential drug targets and mechanisms for these genes via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Fig. 9). As with the DDR pathways (Fig. 6), both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets for the predicted upstream regulators (Fig. 9). Fig. 9. Predicted drug signatures associated with spaceflight response in the skin. Open in a new tab Predicted drug signatures using the cross-mission genes across each dataset represented by a hierarchically clustered heat map. A positive (red) activation state implies cross-mission gene expression changes are consistent with expression changes observed with the indicated drug from curated causal gene expression relationship studies. A negative (blue) activation state implies the cross-mission gene expression changes are opposite to changes observed with the indicated drug.Several drugs were predicted to exhibit significant positive correlation with gene expression changes seen in the space flown mice, with the exception of dorsal skin tissues obtained from C3H/HeJ mice that spent 25 days in flight for the RR-7 mission, and dorsal and femoral skin from the RR-5 mice (30-day recovery) (Fig. 9). For example, calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D, and has been observed to affect skin barrier formation and epidermal differentiation84 it is used clinically to treat plaque psoriasis85. Calcitriol is also associated with immune system alterations in the skin, and topical application in mice has been shown to exacerbate atopic dermatitis86. On the other hand, in a murine model, epidermal permeability and antimicrobial skin barrier impaired by corticosteroid, was shown to be reduced via calcitriol87. Alteration of gene regulatory patterns associated with calcitriol, in the mouse data subsets (Fig. 9) could indicate activation of compensatory mechanisms for spaceflight-induced skin barrier dysfunction, epidermal differentiation, and immune system alterations. L-asparaginase showed the strongest correlation with gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice (Fig. 9). L-asparaginase is used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma and exerts its action by depriving leukemic cells of circulating asparagine, resulting in DNA breaks, cell cycle arrest and cell death87,88. It is also an immunogenic protein and leads to skin rash, dry skin, and hypersensitivity reactions89. Similarly, there was strong positive correlation between gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice associated with use of the Vitamin A derivative tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid)90, and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen91–94. On the contrary, estrogen and diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen, showed a reversed pattern compared to the aforementioned drug targets (Fig. 9). These drugs showed positive correlation with the expression changes in the RR-5 datasets, and the RR-7 25-day C3H/Hej data subset, and negative correlation in the other data subsets (Fig. 9).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied. Here, we have performed a comprehensive study on the molecular impact of spaceflight on skin, with the aim of addressing gaps in the understanding of spaceflight associated skin health risks. Our analysis indicated intriguing gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin of spaceflight vs ground control mice during the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments, that also show some overlaps with molecular alterations observed in astronauts. The genes exhibiting the highest variability across the datasets formed clusters associated with well-established physiological risks of spaceflight, notably immune dysfunction and muscle degradation (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the majority of genes showing significant differential expression across multiple missions in murine data were linked to cell cycle processes, particularly chromosome segregation (Fig. 3a, b). This suggests that skin mirrors common spaceflight signatures observed in other tissues, including dysregulation of cell cycle processes1,19. Further to that point, we see an enrichment of DDR pathways in some data subsets from radiosensitive BALB/c and C3H/HeJ strains75–77 (Fig. 6), which is also a well-established spaceflight response19,74. These repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damage and appear to remain active during the post-flight recovery process, as seen in the RR-5 mission where samples were collected 30 days after flight. This finding is consistent with reports of sustained post-flight DDR activation from the NASA Twins study19. Notably, DNA damage in the skin has important implications for skin cancers including melanoma, of which astronauts carry a higher risk, although the direct correlation between spaceflight and melanoma is still under investigation95,96. Similarly, mitochondrial dysregulation is established as a key molecular signature of spaceflight78, and we see enrichment of an ISR pathway in all but two of the murine skin data subsets (Fig. 7a), which may be driven by increased oxidative stress or DNA damage. ISR activation appears to be impacted by spaceflight duration, as the 25 day time points for RR-7 show a suppression of the ISR pathway1,78. Using an explainable machine learning approach32, we also observed the counteractive mechanism played by D2HGDH, which was generally upregulated in space flown mice (Fig. 7b) indicating an increased need for breakdown of toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) molecules in mitochondria. In this model, the partner gene RPLP0-PS1 codes for the ribosomal protein RPLP0 and is down-regulated in space flown mice. RPLP0 has previously been implicated in the top significant network for the mitochondria-mediated cycle of Alzheimer’s disease97. Low or absent levels of RPLP0 seem to limit the compensatory mechanism in the model (Fig. 7b). If this occurs, build-up of D2H and suppression of certain enzyme functions can result, causing DNA and histones to enter hypermethylated states and activate oncogenes and inhibit tumor suppressors98. Build-up of D2H in the mitochondria may thus be related to cell changes induced by DNA damage from space radiation. Notably, gene regulatory changes associated with mitochondrial dysregulation and DDR were also reported in the skin data from the i4 mission17, corroborating these changes as key molecular hallmarks of spaceflight in the skin. The downregulation of collagen/ECM genes and the suppression of collagen/ECM-related pathways in the MHU-2 mouse mission, where spaceflight samples were collected shortly after landing (Figs. 2b and 5a), mirror findings from previous studies where a reduction in collagen synthesis occurred under hypergravity conditions in cultured human fibroblasts99. In contrast, RR-7 mice (frozen in space) generally exhibited an upregulation of the same collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a), consistent with results from the aforementioned human fibroblast study, which reported a 143% increase in collagen synthesis during microgravity99. Similar to RR-7, RR-5 also showed a trend of upregulation in collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a). The opposing patterns between the MHU-2 mission and RR-5/RR-7 may arise from diverse factors owing to experimental design differences. Notably, the timing of sample collection introduces a critical variable, as seen in the MHU-2 mission where samples were collected less than one day post-flight, in contrast to RR-5, where collection occurred after a 30-day post-flight recovery, and RR-7, where samples were obtained directly in space. This temporal distinction implies that collagen suppression observed in MHU-2 mice may be influenced, at least in part, by the acute hypergravity response, a known factor in decreasing collagen synthesis99, and the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids100–102, rather than being solely attributed to the spaceflight environment. Moreover, differences in sex and housing arrangements further complicate the comparison; MHU-2 mice are singly-housed males, while RR-5 and RR-7 mice are multi-housed females, introducing additional variables that may contribute to the observed disparities100–103. Skin has an anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile104. For instance, fibroblasts exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on their positional identity in relation to the major anatomical axis105. This phenomenon in part explains the predisposition of different sites to different skin conditions104. Although several genes related to collagen synthesis and ECM were downregulated across all four MHU-2 experimental groups, some of these genes showed statistical significance in the dorsal group but not in the femoral group (Fig. 5a). Likewise in the RR-5 mission, during terrestrial recovery, skin biopsies obtained from dorsal skin generally showed a higher reversal of gene expression pattern compared to those obtained from the femoral skin (Figs. 3a and 5a). These changes may be indicative of the variations in gene expression profile, their adaptation response to space flight and re-adaptation to terrestrial environment, at different anatomical sites. Skin biopsies collected from i4 astronauts one day post-flight exhibited a marked downregulation of various collagen/ECM-associated genes in the dermal layer compared to pre-flight conditions (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1) (Fig. 5b). However, certain genes, such as SPARC and COL3A1, showed an upregulation in one or both compartments of the epidermis (Fig. 5b). Moreover, several other collagen/ECM associated genes (e.g. COL14A1, COL15A1, MMP3) were upregulated in both epidermis and the dermis (Fig. 5b). As with the MHU-2 mice, the i4 astronauts’ skin biopsies were obtained one-day post-flight, so some of these effects may have been induced by hypergravity. Nevertheless, blood data obtained from the same i4 astronauts at 1-, 45-, and 82-days post-flight suggests that most gene alterations observed upon landing revert back to normal levels within 82 days following flight, so we may expect a similar response in the skin tissue (Supplementary Figs. 2c and 3c). Previously reported findings from the NASA Twins showed in-flight activation of collagen formation pathways and an increase in COL1A1 and COL3A1 proteins detected in the urine, indicative of structural remodeling19. These changes, as with the majority of spaceflight-induced changes, were also reported to revert to baseline post-flight19. Some of the changes reported by astronauts during and after spaceflight, such as dryness and contact dermatitis, point to an impaired barrier function17,95 our results support this hypothesis. FLG is a gene expressed in the stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis, during the epidermal differentiation process41. It encodes profilaggrin, a major component of keratohyalin granules found in the keratinocytes that is dephosphorylated and cleaved into filaggrin106,107. During conversion of keratinocyte cell membrane to cornified cell envelope, filaggrin aggregates and aligns intermediate filaments such as keratin 1 and keratin 10, within the cytoskeleton of keratinocytes, and subsequently a cross-linking process is initiated by proteins such as involucrin and locicrin108,109. This results in compactization and flattening of the corneocytes, one of the constituents of the skin barrier110. We identified FLG as one of the cross-mission genes in the spaceflight vs ground control mice data with downregulation across the majority of data subsets (all except RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we observed post-flight vs pre-flight downregulation of FLG in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b). Caspase-14, an enzyme encoded by the CASP14 gene, cleaves filaggrin, breaking it down into free amino acids. These amino acids serve as integral components of natural moisturizing factors, contributing to the preservation of skin hydration and pH111. Additionally, they play a crucial role in antimicrobial defense, further contributing to the multifaceted functions of the skin barrier61,112,113. Similar to FLG, CASP14 demonstrated downregulation in the majority of murine skin subsets (excluding RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a), the epidermal layer of i4 astronaut skin tissue (Fig. 5b), and JAXA hair follicles (Fig. 5c). This observation is important considering the crucial role CASP14 plays in skin barrier formation and its involvement in skin conditions such as contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis53,61,62,114. The link between filaggrin deficiency and dry skin, altered pH, atopic and contact dermatitis, and ichthyosis vulgaris is also well-known54,60,112,115–117. CASP14 was also the driver of one of the two main QLattice models we found to be maximally relevant and minimally redundant among the cross-mission genes, resulting in a very simple model involving only CASP14 and S1PR1 with an AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 3d). S1PR1 was upregulated in most murine skin subsets (Fig. 3a), the in-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b), and in all compartments for the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 astronauts’ skin samples (Fig. 4a). In the RR-5 mission, after a 30-day recovery, in-flight effects may have been reversed as S1PR1 expression was downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is also consistent with downregulation in the post-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b). Downregulation of S1PR1 has been reported to be necessary for activation of resident memory CD8 + T cells in skin35 and has previously been observed in CD8 + T cells from murine skin during response to Herpes Simplex Virus Infection118. While the S1P-S1PR axis has inhibitory roles in keratinocyte proliferation, it was also shown to contribute to the process of chemotaxis119. For instance, in Staphylococcus-aureus-stimulated keratinocytes; TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-36γ release was induced via involvement of S1PR1 and S1PR2120. Higher expression levels of S1PR1 and S1PR2 observed in the skin of impetigo patients and changes in the distribution patterns of these receptors were also aligned with these findings120. Herpes Simplex Virus reactivation3,4,95 and Staphylococcus colonization in the skin10,17,121 (which could also be influenced by breakdown of filaggrin altering pH levels122) have been widely reported in astronauts, therefore alterations in S1PR1, CASP14, and FLG, are of importance. At present, there is a lack of widely accepted countermeasures to effectively mitigate the damage caused to the skin induced by exposure to the space environment. Our analysis has identified drugs capable of altering similar molecular changes that manifest in the skin during spaceflight (Fig. 9). Several drugs, including calcitriol, tretinoin, and tamoxifen showed significant positive correlation with regulatory changes in all data subsets from the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions except for the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point (Fig. 9). Tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative is a retinoid known for its applications in treating acne and leukemia, exerts its effects through the activation of retinoic acid receptors, influencing various skin processes such as increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation of epidermal cells, increased keratinocyte turnover, increased collagen synthesis, inhibited UV radiation induced metalloproteinase activity, and melanin reduction23,123,124. Tretinoin treatment on reconstructed human epidermis was shown to induce loss of keratohyalin granules and reduce filaggrin and Keratin 10 expression125. Retinoids have also been observed to downregulate caspase-14 expression in in-vitro reconstructed skin models126. Dry skin and exfoliation are common side effects during its use123. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to exhibit both agoniztic and antagonistic effects depending on the tissue94. Its use in breast cancer patients is linked to cutaneous adverse events, including dry skin, itching, and occasionally radiation recall dermatitis and baboon syndrome (a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction)126–129. Furthermore, tamoxifen induces androgen receptor expression in hair follicles, leading to tamoxifen-induced alopecia in some cases130, and abnormal hair follicles, epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis have been observed in rat models131. On the other hand, only olaparib, estrogen, and diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic form of estrogen) showed an opposing pattern, with significant negative correlation in all data subsets except for those from the RR-5 mission and the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point of the RR-7 mission (Fig. 9). Estrogen plays a crucial role in skin health, influencing keratinocyte function, collagen production, moisture retention and telogen-anagen follicle transition132–135. In an explant model of fetal rat skin development, estrogen was shown to increase filaggrin expression136. Conversely, estrogen deficiency during menopause is associated with adverse skin changes such as loss of collagen, skin dryness and atrophy137,138. Overall, molecular alterations observed in the space flown mice and astronaut skin data show similarities with molecular effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen123, such as FLG and CASP14 downregulation, while symptoms reported in astronauts including dry skin and dermatitis also resemble side effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen106 (Fig. 9). Topical moisturizers and emollients, as commonly used by astronauts15,95, may help to counteract the physiological consequences of disrupted barrier function genes, and may also help to explain why results on impact of spaceflight on skin physiological parameters in astronauts have been mixed14,15, despite physiological evidence of skin damage in space flown rodents12. In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight on skin health. Currently, there is a gap in knowledge for how space radiation and microgravity affects skin biology, yet many of the common themes of spaceflight dysfunction emerged in our analysis, suggesting that skin could be an easily-accessible candidate for studying the biological impact of spaceflight. Our systems biology analysis revealed some genes of interest and potential mechanisms to investigate in the context of countermeasures that can be utilized in future studies. We believe with our study we have started to address the current gaps and provided some clues on how to potentially mitigate the adverse effects of the space environment to the skin. The rodent datasets used come from three different spaceflight experiments with a variety of confounding variables associated with differences in study design. This means that direct comparison between the experiments is challenging, but indeed this also presents an opportunity to hypothesize how these factors may influence biology, as done in this manuscript. A lack of physiological data, such as dermal thickness, and lack of individual skin layer data from the rodent datasets means that generated hypotheses relating to mouse physiology cannot be confirmed without follow-up investigations, but the comparison to astronaut data helps translate the results to human relevance. Lastly, gene expression levels differ between skin compartments so an identical fold-change value in a layer where the specific gene expression is generally low may not represent the same magnitude in a layer where the same gene’s expression is relatively greater. As such, for the i4 skin data we focused on changes in the compartments where the gene is established to be predominantly expressed.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166967 PMID: 38862781 Previous version available: This article is based on a previously available preprint posted on Research Square on February 10, 2023: \"More than a Feeling: Dermatological Changes Impacted by Spaceflight\". Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.Conclusion Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.Subject terms: Systems biology, Skin diseasesPlain language summary Spaceflight is a hostile environment which can lead to health problems in astronauts, including in the skin. It is not currently well understood why these skin problems occur. Here, we analyzed data from the skin of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts. Cope, Elsborg et al. analyzed transcriptomic data from mice and astronauts flown to space and identified molecular signatures of DNA damage and repair, mitochondrial dysregulation, and skin barrier disruption. These changes may underpin dermatological issues in astronauts.Introduction Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions. As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17. In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions.Methods Ethics and inclusion statement This manuscript has included authors from all backgrounds from the scientific international community and the results are held at the highest ethical standards. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs and according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Inspiration4 (I4) mission was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after informed consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All crewmembers consented to data and sample sharing. The NASA Twin Study subjects signed informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki and 14 CFR Part 1230 for collection and use of sample materials and data in research protocols at NASA and the collaborating institutions. Study protocols were approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Review Board (protocol number Pro1245) and all participating institutions. Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values. No ethical approval for this manuscript was required to use the JAXA astronaut data since this was publicly available data on the GeneLab platform. In addition the data made available on GeneLab was only provided as anonymized aggregate data.GeneLab spaceflight murine datasets Five RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-238, OSD-239, OSD-240, OSD-241, OSD-254) were downloaded from the NASA OSDR via the API, and full dataset descriptions can be found on the dataset pages. These datasets are derived from whole murine skin samples from the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments. For MHU-2, singly-housed male C57BL/6J mice were 9 weeks of age when flown on the ISS for 30 days; they were euthanized less than 1 day after return to Earth. Dorsal and femoral skin samples were extracted from MHU-2 mice, and 6 replicates in spaceflight microgravity and the matching 6 replicates in the 1G ground control were split into 2 sets of 3, with half fed a JAXA chow diet and the other half fed JAXA chow with supplemental FOS18. For RR-5, 30 week old BALB/c mice in shared housing were flown on the ISS for 30 days; following return to Earth, mice were given 30 days to recover before euthanasia and extraction of dorsal and femoral skin tissue. Finally, for RR-7, 11 week old C57BL/6J mice and C3H/HeJ mice were flown on the ISS for either 25 or 75 days before being euthanized on-orbit.RNA-Seq analysis of rodent datasets Raw counts data, derived via a previously reported pipeline20, were downloaded from the NASA OSDR and loaded with tximport (v1.28.0). ERCC genes were filtered out, as were genes with zero counts in the minimum number of samples corresponding to a single condition. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the Wald significance test was performed on spaceflight microgravity and ground control samples using the R package DESeq221 (v1.40.2). For each data subset, microgravity spaceflight samples were contrasted with ground control samples and cook’s cut off and independent filtering were not used. Mapping of mouse ENSEMBL gene IDs to gene symbols and human orthologs was done using the R Package biomaRt (v2.56.1) and ENSEMBL 105. For human orthologs, one-to-many mapping was supported. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All DGE statistics for the rodent data, including the list of cross-mission genes, can be found in Supplementary Data 1.Pathway analysis of rodent datasets For Over Representation Analysis (ORA), the R package clusterProfiler (v4.8.3) was used on vectors of genes and bar plots were made via ggplot2 (v3.4.4). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the R package FGSEA (v1.26.0) was used. GSEA was performed on all DEGs for all data subsets, with rank vectors consisting of HGNC symbols and corresponding sorted t-scores in the data subset. MSigDB human collections H, C2, and C5 were used (v7.4) and set sizes >15 were permitted. For the mitochondrial pathway analysis, human pathways from MitoPathways (v3.0), with some additional custom curated pathways (Supplementary Table 1), were used and set sizes >1 were permitted. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All GSEA results, including mitochondrial results, can be found in Supplementary Data 2.RNA-Seq data analysis on Twin Study samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the ISS and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for a total of 19 time points for the flight subject and 13 time points for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation and processing see ref. 19. Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80 °C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4 °C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 h including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per19 using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits. As previously reported19, generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto22 on ENSEMBL transcripts. Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq221 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells20,23. Reads were mapped onto an updated reference genome (GRCh38)24.JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through the NASA OSDR with accession number: OSD-53025. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. In total 2-3 pre-flight samples (L-168 ± 14 days, L-112 ± 14 days, L-56 ± 14 days), 4 in-flight samples (L + 5 ± 1 day, L + 30 ± 7 days, L + 60 ± 14 days, L + 120 ± 14d or R-8 (−14d/+0d day)), and 3-4 post-flight samples (R + 3 ± 1 day, R + 30 ± 7 days, R + 60 ± 14 days, R + 120 ± 14 days) were collected per astronaut. As provided by OSDR, data points for all subjects were pooled into one group per mission phase.JAXA astronaut hair follicle data Gene expression data from 10 JAXA astronauts’ hair follicles13 was downloaded from the NASA OSDR (OSD-174). Raw data for 60 total samples was processed using LIMMA with R/bioconductor26. Briefly, duplicate sample single-color Agilent microarray data was background corrected, filtered for low expression probes, and quantile normalized. Differential gene expression was measured between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight data points using p-values adjusted for False Discovery Rates (FDR) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. As previously described13 hair follicle samples were collected from each astronaut on 6-month ISS missions at two pre-flight time points (firstly between L-180 and L-90, and secondly between L-60 and L-14), two in-flight time points (firstly between L + 20 and L + 37, and secondly between R-20 and R-7), and two post-flight time points (firstly between R + 2 and R + 7, and secondly between R + 30 and R + 90).Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre- and post-flight, and will be accessible via the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)27. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference28. Reads were mapped onto a recent reference genome (GRCh38)24. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported [Ref. 29]. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). As previously described in detail17, these biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. Based on staining images using fluorescent antibodies, a total of 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) were profiled across outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. The IE and OE regions represented stratum basale, and stratum spinosum with stratum granulosum, respectively. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform DGE analysis. Records of vitamin D supplement consumption were not available for the i4 crew. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).Astronaut physiological data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006-2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. These missions were 4–6 months in length, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return + 0, R + 0) and again 30-d later (R + 30). The R + 0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 h after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 h after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre- and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described30. We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as previously reported31. As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p < 0.001 are reported. The data was plotted using R package ggplot2 (v3.3.5).QLattice symbolic regression modeling We used symbolic regression (QLattice v3.0.132) to construct models involving combinations of synergistic genes which map from the gene expressions to spaceflight status. For these models, we only distinguish between mice that went to space and mice that did not. Conventional statistical methods typically allow for calculating the effect of a single gene at a time through metrics such as p-values and false discovery rates. In contrast, symbolic regression models can reveal combinations of genes and modules that best predict spaceflight status. These could be linear combinations involving two or more genes that have previously also been shown to be statistically significant, or it could be non-linear combinations that reveal features that on their own were non-significant but in synergy with a second feature become highly predictive. In addition, known biological functions of genes included in models, as well as the resultant mathematical relationship between them, can potentially be interpreted to reveal regulations or interactions that are affected by spaceflight. In biological pathway analysis, it is well-known that up- or down-regulation of one gene can have cascading effects, such that the function of one gene becomes sensitive to that of another33. It has previously been demonstrated that parsimonious machine learning models are able to provide accurate outcome prediction in omics data, while preserving interpretability34,35. The interpretability often results from the fact that models might demonstrate otherwise opaque relations, which become clear when combined effects are considered. An example could be an interaction where the regulation of a single gene is itself unimportant for functional changes, unless another gene is simultaneously regulated. This would indicate a synergistic compound effect, which naturally can expand to a 3-, 4- or 5-gene synergy and beyond. The combined effect of two or more individually insignificant gene expression levels may thus theoretically be more powerful than the effect of a single gene with low p-value. Thus, traditional statistical analysis masks such effects by the use of metrics related to the individual gene.UMAP dimensional reduction and gene clustering For the clustering of genes shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a uniqueness filtering by first dropping all genes where more than a quarter of the samples had identical expression levels. Subsequently, we filtered out all genes with a variance of less than 1.7, resulting in 2184 filtered genes with high variability. Fig. 1. Global data overview. Open in a new tab a Breakdown of the rodent datasets used in this study. b Clustering of the most variable genes within the rodent datasets with functional annotation.A dimensional reduction was performed subsequent to filtering by uniformly distributing the filtered data on a Riemannian manifold, using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). UMAP is a general purpose manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm which is similar to t-SNE in that it predominantly preserves local structure. Yet, UMAP preserves more global structure, which makes it a more suited algorithm when the objective of the dimensional reduction is more than simple visualization (in this case the objective is clustering). Genes were then clustered using the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)36. A primary advantage of HDBSCAN is that it is always deterministic for the same hyperparameters, and will thus always return the same clustering, all else being equal. In addition, comparable clustering algorithms such as k-means do not perform well unless clusters are of equal size and density with few outliers. With biological data such as gene expressions, we expect large variation in cluster size and density, making HDBSCAN the ideal choice. Once genes were clustered, the gene sets belonging to each cluster were extracted and analyzed using three ontology databases in the Python implementation, GSEAPY, of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis37 tool Enrichr38. We used the Elsevier Pathway Collection, the 2021 WikiPathway Collection, and the 2021 MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 4 Collection. These enrichment analyses were used to provide context to each cluster by appending an annotation if a notable amount of hits showed up for a particular association.Regulatory network analysis We used the differential gene expression data from all cross-mission genes across each comparison to perform an upstream regulator analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-0139). We identified the biological or chemical drugs in the QIAGEN IPA library of regulators, defined as having a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 and an absolute Z-score >1. Drugs from the dataset that met these criteria and were associated with similar log2 fold-change patterns in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were visualized by hierarchical clustering of the unstandardized Z-scores using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric, and complete-linkage method for agglomeration. Statistics on the full list of drug targets can be found in Supplementary Data 3.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Results Spaceflight transcriptome global changes in rodent skin reflect common biological hallmarks of spaceflight To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates. These datasets are derived from three different spaceflight missions (Fig. 1a). The most variable genes across the datasets cluster into functional groups related to established physiological risks of spaceflight (Fig. 1b). For example, spaceflight is known to induce immune dysfunction1 and Cluster 1 involves highly-correlated genes associated with immune response, including genes linked to modulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Microgravity is also well established to cause degradation of muscle1, and Cluster 9 contains a significant number of genes related to muscular morphology and muscle disorders. Ionizing radiation is known to cause renal and pulmonary fibrosis41,42 and profibrosis-like alterations were previously observed in lung tissue of mice returned from Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118)43. Renal and lung fibrosis associated genes found in Cluster 7, and genes encoding proteins involved in sclerotic diseases grouped in Cluster 8, further supports these reports. Upon subsetting each dataset based on experimental groups (i.e. diet, strain, skin site) and performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis for spaceflight samples versus ground control samples, we end up with 10 data subsets (Fig. 2a). In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.1) in at least 2 out of the 10 data subsets. One significant DEG shared across data subsets from the RR-7 study is GLYCAM1 which is shared between both data subsets for the C57BL/6 J strain. GLYCAM1, a ligand for L-selectin that has been proposed to modulate leukocyte transendothelial migration from blood44, is strongly upregulated (Log2 Fold Change (LFC) ≈ 18.81, FDR < 10−6) at the 25 day time point and strongly downregulated (LFC ≈ −15.66, FDR < 0.002) at the 75 day time point, which could indicate a relationship between spaceflight duration and immune alterations for the C57BL/6J mice. Over representation analysis (ORA) reveals that a large proportion of the 244 significant DEGs shared between MHU-2 data subsets are associated with the organization of collagen and the ECM (Fig. 2b). Significant modulation of genes associated with ECM homeostasis was previously reported in analyses of the skin of space flown mice11,12. The MHU-2 subset from the dorsal skin of mice fed a standard JAXA chow diet with supplemental prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) contains the highest quantity of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) DEGs by a substantial margin (Fig. 2a). In ground-based rodent studies, FOS has been shown to improve gut microbiome balance, increase bone density, and affect the immune system through increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (modifying interleukin production and natural killer cell activity), and modification of the immune system via gut-associated lymphoid tissue18,45. Due to the disparity between the number of significant DEGs in the data subsets, and the variety of conditions between data subsets, care must be taken when combining these data subsets to infer shared responses of rodent skin to spaceflight.

Open in a new tab a An upset plot showing the number of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight versus ground data subsets and the number of overlapping significant DEGs between these data subsets.

For the majority of the significant DEGs, there is a trend of downregulation in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Supplementary Fig. 1). A smaller cluster of genes (e.g., LAMA1, S1PR1, HMGCS2, TXNIP, IGFBP3, ADGRF5, CAR4, HSD17B11, C1QTNF9, KLF11) are also significant in those same data subsets, but are significantly upregulated (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Cross-mission genes involved in rodent skin spaceflight response. Open in a new tab a A heatmap showing regulatory changes of select cross-mission genes (genes that are significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed between flight and ground control across multiple missions) within each rodent data subset. b A bar plot showing the GOBP pathways that the full list of cross-mission genes are involved in. c A decision boundary plot of the strongest cross-mission QLattice model using only the expression of two genes as input features to predict the spaceflight status of the all mice in the data. d A decision boundary plot of the second-strongest model across all missions.To go beyond single-gene significance, we use QLattice modeling32 to construct models that predict the spaceflight status of all samples in the data (i.e. from all data subsets). These models use the expression of two genes at most to arrive at maximally relevant and minimally redundant models. In Fig. 3c, d, we show the decision boundaries of the two strongest models found, with Area Under Curve (AUC) scores of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. Both models show that the spaceflight status is well separated using only the expression of two genes as input, while also having plausible biological interpretations, which we discuss in the following sections. The 189 cross-mission DEGs are primarily involved in cell-cycle pathways (Fig. 3b), with several of the genes (e.g. LAMA1, C1QTNF9, HMGCS2, TXNIP, KLF11) clustering with average trends of upregulation across the datasets (Fig. 3a). Spaceflight is well-documented to perturb the cell-cycle1. These genes tend also to be involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with diabetes; HMGCS2 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation46, while LAMA1 and KLF11 variations have been shown to be risk factors in type 2 diabetes47,48. Aside from being a protector against oxidative stress, TXNIP is similarly implicated in metabolic diseases, and is typically upregulated in diabetic and prediabetic muscle tissue49. C1QTNF9 (also known as CTRP9) has also emerged as a potentially important component of pathways involving lipid metabolism and adipose tissue, exemplified by the fact that C1QTNF9 transgenic mice have been shown to resist weight gain and metabolic dysfunction50. It is interesting to note that upregulation of these metabolic pathway genes appears generally weaker for female mice. This might be linked to the same mechanisms offering higher protection for females against diet-induced obesity compared to male mice, as has been noted in other studies51. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) axis have been implicated in pathogenesis of both inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases and also plays a role in skin’s immune response to viral infection52. In both MHU-2 and RR-7 missions S1PR1 is enriched, while this effect is reversed in RR-5 after 30-day recovery (Fig. 3a). On the contrary FLG (Filaggrin), CASP14, KRT2, genes involved in cornified envelope and skin barrier formation36–38,53–55, generally showed an opposite trend in gene expression patterns (Fig. 3a). CASP14 is also the main driver of the second-most predictive 2-gene QLattice model obtained from the cross-mission key gene list, which involved a combined model of CASP14 and S1PR1 (Fig. 3d). OXTR, identified as a key driver in the most predictive 2-gene QLattice model derived from the cross-mission key gene list, along with SLC6A18 (Fig. 3c), is predominantly localized in the basal layer of the epidermis. Its primary expression is attributed to keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts56. OXTR together with oxytocin has been shown to mediate oxidative stress response in the skin56. Our analysis revealed an increase in gene expression of OXTR across all missions and experimental conditions except for C3H/Hej mice in the RR-7 mission at the 25-day time point (Fig. 3a). Both estrogens and androgens play an important role in skin and hair physiology. HSD17B11, which has a stronger expression in steroidogenic cells such as sebaceous glands, has been predicted to be involved in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis, and conversion 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to androsterone57. Similar to the pattern observed in OXTR, HSD17B11 expression was increased in all murine datasets except for RR-5 dorsal skin group (Fig. 3a).Astronaut data correlates with select gene expression changes occurring across missions in the murine skin models Having investigated a set of cross-mission genes regulated by spaceflight in rodent skin, we then decided to investigate the expression of human orthologs of these genes in astronaut studies. Firstly, we use post-flight vs pre-flight gene expression data from skin samples collected during the i4 mission. Similar to the patterns observed in murine models (Fig. 3a), FLG and CASP14, which play significant roles in skin barrier formation, are also downregulated in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 4a), where they are primarily expressed. In the literature, FLG is reported to mainly be expressed in stratum granulosum58, with mutations associated with dry skin, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis as well as ichthyosis vulgaris54,59,60. CASP14 on the other hand is known to be primarily expressed in differentiating and cornifying layers44 and decreased levels were detected in lesional skin biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis61,62. Likewise, KRT2 which was downregulated across all subgroups in the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions (Fig. 3a), was also downregulated in the skin of i4 astronauts, with strongest downregulation in outer epidermis where it is primarily expressed but also in inner epidermis and outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Additionally, similarly to the trend of upregulation in the rodent data (Fig. 3a), OXTR is upregulated across all compartments studied in the i4 skin (Fig. 4a) and HSD17B11 is upregulated in both compartments of the epidermis and in the outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. The profile of the cross-mission genes in astronauts. Open in a new tab a Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. b Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In some astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight, decrease in melanin content has been previously reported63. In the inner epidermis of the i4 skin data, where melanin synthesis takes place, we found downregulation of two genes associated with melanin biosynthesis, TYRP1 and DCT64 (Fig. 4a). However, TYR which synthesizes tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis was upregulated in the same compartment65 (Fig. 4a). TYR, DCT, and TYRP1 clustered in the rodent data, with an average trend of downregulation, particularly in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Fig. 3a). We also analyze gene expression data from the blood of astronauts from the NASA Twins, JAXA CFE studies, and i4 studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the NASA Twins Study, the most noteworthy results are in CD4 cell type in-flight vs pre-flight samples with significant downregulation in a group of genes (e.g. DSC2, TMEM252, CEBPD, CA4, and PTGS2, and OTX1) persisting post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These genes display no significant changes in CD8 cells, which may indicate that their downregulation is a response to immune system stressors affecting the helper function and signaling of CD4 cells. DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), STIL and TOP2A cell-cycle associated genes are amongst the most strongly upregulated genes in-flight compared to pre-flight in the CD8 cells, and exhibit downregulation post-flight to trend towards pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In the CFE study, several genes were strongly upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight (e.g., OXTR, PRR9, ERCC6L) in the blood samples from JAXA astronauts (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In the i4 mission blood samples the majority of genes show a pronounced suppression in the time point immediately before flight, which could be indicative of increased stress prior to launch. Several genes then show strong upregulation at the first post-flight time point (e.g., BARD1, BRCA1, RAD54B, EXO1, OXTR, and HSD17B11) (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting upregulation due to spaceflight or landing stressors, followed by post-flight recovery towards baseline expression levels from second post-flight time point and beyond. However, some other genes appear to show a delayed upregulation following spaceflight, as they are upregulated in the second post-flight time point, two months after flight (e.g. KLF11, CA4, OXT1, TM4SF4) and return towards baseline at the third post-flight time point (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gene expression alterations in these sets of genes are potentially due to a re-adaptation response.Specific pathways and genes related to skin health are altered in spaceflight To determine direct relevance of spaceflight to skin health, we conduct targeted analysis with a curated list of key pathways involved in skin health from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and identify which of these pathways and associated genes are significantly modulated in the murine skin datasets. A collagen biosynthesis pathway and a set of collagen genes (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) suppressed/downregulated across all dataset subsets for the MHU-2 mission, while showing a trend of weak enrichment/upregulation across the two other missions (Fig. 5a). Additionally, several collagen and/or ECM related genes (e.g., MMP3, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL15A1, COL6A3, SPARC, PCOLCE, and PYCR1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) downregulated in all of the MHU-2 data subsets except femoral skin with the standard diet, and a few collagen related genes were significantly downregulated only in the dorsal subsets from the MHU-2 mission (e.g., P3H1, CRTAP, COL14A1, and FKBP14) (Fig. 5a). Overall, the distinct collagen/ECM downregulation signature (Fig. 5a) suggests that a study design difference in the MHU-2 mission (compared to the RR-5 and RR-7 missions), where the use of young single-housed male mice or dissection shortly after the hypergravity event of Live Animal Return (LAR) may have suppressed collagen biosynthesis. Similarly, we find an overall trend of enrichment of pathways relating to thin skin and dermal atrophy in the RR-5 and RR-7 mice, with suppression occurring in the MHU-2 mice (Fig. 5a), likely driven by regulatory patterns in the collagen-associated genes. While there is a general trend of upregulation, the RR-5 mission generally lacks any significant results for genes relating to skin health, which could be due to the 30 days of recovery post-flight. In addition to being reported as cross-mission genes in the previous section, CASP14, FLG and KRT2 were also identified as key skin health genes (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Behavior of the specific genes associated with skin health in astronauts and rodents. Open in a new tab a The orange (suppressed) and green (enriched) heatmap shows the normalized enrichment score (NES) of curated skin health pathways (full list Supplementary Table 1) that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one rodent subset. The red (upregulated) and blue (downregulated) heatmap shows the t-score for leading edge genes from the significant pathways that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) in at least two data subsets. b Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. c Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In post-flight vs pre-flight skin samples from the i4 mission, several collagen/ECM genes (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) were downregulated across the whole dermis, whereas COL5A1 was only downregulated in the vascular compartment of the dermis (Fig. 5b). MMP3, which induces accelerated loss of skin collagen when there is inflammation, was upregulated across the whole dermal layer65 (Fig. 5b). Likewise, several genes (e.g., P3H1, COL14A1, COL15A1, and COLA12A1) were upregulated in both compartments of the dermis (Fig. 5b). KRT24, involved in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, is reported to be mainly confined to stratum spinosum with slight overexpression in senescent keratinocytes49 and has been shown to induce apoptosis of keratinocytes66. In the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 skin data KRT24 is upregulated in all compartments of the skin with a more prominent increase in outer epidermis and vascular layers66 (Fig. 5b). Late cornified envelope genes (LCE) are located in the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1 and in the skin their expression is known to be mainly confined to the epidermis, specifically to upper stratum granulosum and premature cornified envelopes67,68. In both the inner epidermis and outer dermis of the i4 skin data, LCE2A, LCE2B, LCE2C, LCE2D, genes that respond to UV and calcium67 and LCE5A were upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight (Fig. 5b). In the NASA Twins study blood samples, COL6A2 was upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight in CD8 cells, with PYCR1 following the same pattern in CD4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the CFE study, blood samples from JAXA astronauts had strong in-flight upregulation of RPTN and COL3A1, and in particular LCE2B, where upregulation increased further post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). On the other hand, PYCR1 and GJB6 showed the opposite trend in gene expression, with strong downregulation in-flight and almost complete reversal upon return (Supplementary Fig. 3b). PYCR1, which was upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight in all skin layers of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b) encodes pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in proline synthesis via utilization of NADH or NADPH. Proline plays an important role in collagen synthesis and PYCR1 deficiency results in collagen and elastin abnormalities69. Conversely, COL3A1 encodes alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, which is an EMP synthesized in cells as pre-collagen and its accumulation was shown to cause fibrosis in various organs70,71. In case of LCE2C and KRT33A, weak in-flight downregulation was followed by strong post-flight upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Although less apparent, this trend for KRT33A was also observed in the JAXA HAIR data (Fig. 5c). KRT33A, one of the type 1 hair keratin genes, is known to be highly expressed in the cortex of hair follicles, and its expression is reported to decrease with age72. Lastly, genes such as COL6A2 and FKBP14, a collagen/ECM related gene associated with diseases such as kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, hearing impairment, muscle hypotonia and occasional vascular fragility like aortic rupture73, were downregulated in-flight and their average expression persisted post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b).Radiosensitivity of mouse strains impacts DNA damage response in the skin following spaceflight As part of our targeted analysis, we also opted to investigate the modulation of DNA damage and repair pathways in rodent skin. DNA damage and repair is a well-established response to space radiation19,74 and little research is reported on the consequences this will have on the skin during spaceflight. When ionizing radiation hits DNA molecules, single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, with DDR mechanisms activated to repair these breaks74. For the majority of DNA damage and repair pathways, both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets (Fig. 6). In these three data subsets, pathways relating to DNA damage and repair are generally enriched, while being suppressed in other data subsets. BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice, as used in these data subsets, have been shown to be more radiosensitive compared to C57BL/6J mice75–77, so repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate increased radiation-induced DNA damage. In the C3H/HeJ mice there is a trend of decreasing activity for the DDR pathways from the 25-day to 75-day time points which could indicate either adaptation of the DNA repair pathways over time in space or dysregulation following extended-duration spaceflight (Fig. 6). The enrichment of DDR pathways in RR-5 also follows 30-days of spaceflight and a post-flight recovery period of 30-days (Fig. 6). However, DNA repair genes were reported to still be enriched compared to pre-flight levels when evaluated at 6-months post-flight during the NASA Twins study19, so persistent DDR activation during post-flight recovery in the mice could be indicative of a similar mechanism. Fig. 6. DNA damage and repair pathways being regulated in rodents flown to space. Open in a new tab Heatmap of pathways relating to DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (full list Supplementary Table 1), significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one data subset.Mitochondrial dysregulation increased in the skin during spaceflight Mitochondrial stress has been identified as a key hub for spaceflight response in multi-tissue analysis, yet skin was not included78. Skin is a tissue with high turnover and energy requirements79, so we decided to investigate spaceflight changes relating to mitochondrial stress in murine skin. We find that spaceflight alters mitochondrial pathways in the skin (Fig. 7a), as previously observed in other tissues and across species78. Enrichment of an integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in all but two of the dataset subsets (Fig. 7a) is consistent with a previous report of potentially activated ISR due to mitochondrial dysfunction in space flown mice78. Interestingly, the two data subsets where ISR appeared to instead be suppressed were the 25 day time points for both strains from the RR-7 mission (Fig. 7a), implicating spaceflight duration as an important factor for modulating ISR. Additionally, we ran the QLattice machine learning model on the full gene set to obtain a set of models that were unbiased by feature selection due to e.g. variance filtering and the selection of cross-mission genes. One of the 10 strongest 2-feature models involved the expression of the genes D2HGDH (D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase)80 and RPLP0-PS1 (a gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPLP0). The model’s decision boundary (Fig. 7b) demonstrates how the simultaneous upregulation of D2HGDH and downregulation of RPLP0-PS1 characterizes the space-flown mice, with a resulting AUC score of 0.8280. The upregulation of D2HGDH generally indicates an increased ability to break down the toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) compound in the mitochondria. In our case, this could be a compensatory mechanism due to larger build-up of the compound, and the model suggests that this is further dependent on the abundance of the RPLP0 protein. Fig. 7. Mitochondrial specific analysis on rodent spaceflight skin tissue. Open in a new tab a Heatmap of pathways relating to the mitochondria, significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least 1 data subset. b Decision boundary for the 2-gene model related to mitochondrial changes. The model indicates an increased removal of the toxic D2H compound in mitochondria through upregulation of D2HGDH, which is less pronounced when PPP1R3B expression is suppressed.Circulating physiological markers from astronauts indicate that exercise countermeasures may have improved skin health We investigate standard physiological biomarkers collected from astronaut urine and blood81,82 to see whether average trends in these biomarkers connect to spaceflight gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin (Fig. 8). In-flight increases in IGF-1, leptin and white blood cell levels may indicate altered stress response due to spaceflight. Following a hypothesis that improved countermeasures may improve skin physiological parameters in astronauts on the ISS14,15, we split the data into astronauts that used the older Interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), and astronauts that used the newer Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Notably, overlapping data to that shown in Fig. 8 have been used as evidence of improvements in parameters relating to bone mineral density81. Indeed, while vitamin D decreased in-flight and normalized upon return to Earth for both exercise devices, ARED appeared to reduce this drop. Vitamin D is well-established to be an important mediator of skin health83. Notably, this decrease in vitamin D is observed despite consistent programmatic vitamin D supplementation since the collection of blood samples81. Fig. 8. Astronaut physiological markers compiled from up to 50 astronauts. Open in a new tab a Specific blood markers which contain data points for pre-launch (L−), flight (FD), and return to Earth (R+).

As with the DDR pathways (Fig. 6), both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets for the predicted upstream regulators (Fig. 9). Fig. 9. Predicted drug signatures associated with spaceflight response in the skin. Open in a new tab Predicted drug signatures using the cross-mission genes across each dataset represented by a hierarchically clustered heat map. A positive (red) activation state implies cross-mission gene expression changes are consistent with expression changes observed with the indicated drug from curated causal gene expression relationship studies. A negative (blue) activation state implies the cross-mission gene expression changes are opposite to changes observed with the indicated drug.Several drugs were predicted to exhibit significant positive correlation with gene expression changes seen in the space flown mice, with the exception of dorsal skin tissues obtained from C3H/HeJ mice that spent 25 days in flight for the RR-7 mission, and dorsal and femoral skin from the RR-5 mice (30-day recovery) (Fig. 9). For example, calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D, and has been observed to affect skin barrier formation and epidermal differentiation84 it is used clinically to treat plaque psoriasis85. Calcitriol is also associated with immune system alterations in the skin, and topical application in mice has been shown to exacerbate atopic dermatitis86. On the other hand, in a murine model, epidermal permeability and antimicrobial skin barrier impaired by corticosteroid, was shown to be reduced via calcitriol87. Alteration of gene regulatory patterns associated with calcitriol, in the mouse data subsets (Fig. 9) could indicate activation of compensatory mechanisms for spaceflight-induced skin barrier dysfunction, epidermal differentiation, and immune system alterations. L-asparaginase showed the strongest correlation with gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice (Fig. 9). L-asparaginase is used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma and exerts its action by depriving leukemic cells of circulating asparagine, resulting in DNA breaks, cell cycle arrest and cell death87,88. It is also an immunogenic protein and leads to skin rash, dry skin, and hypersensitivity reactions89. Similarly, there was strong positive correlation between gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice associated with use of the Vitamin A derivative tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid)90, and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen91–94. On the contrary, estrogen and diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen, showed a reversed pattern compared to the aforementioned drug targets (Fig. 9). These drugs showed positive correlation with the expression changes in the RR-5 datasets, and the RR-7 25-day C3H/Hej data subset, and negative correlation in the other data subsets (Fig. 9).Discussion Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied. Here, we have performed a comprehensive study on the molecular impact of spaceflight on skin, with the aim of addressing gaps in the understanding of spaceflight associated skin health risks. Our analysis indicated intriguing gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin of spaceflight vs ground control mice during the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments, that also show some overlaps with molecular alterations observed in astronauts. The genes exhibiting the highest variability across the datasets formed clusters associated with well-established physiological risks of spaceflight, notably immune dysfunction and muscle degradation (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the majority of genes showing significant differential expression across multiple missions in murine data were linked to cell cycle processes, particularly chromosome segregation (Fig. 3a, b). This suggests that skin mirrors common spaceflight signatures observed in other tissues, including dysregulation of cell cycle processes1,19. Further to that point, we see an enrichment of DDR pathways in some data subsets from radiosensitive BALB/c and C3H/HeJ strains75–77 (Fig. 6), which is also a well-established spaceflight response19,74. These repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damage and appear to remain active during the post-flight recovery process, as seen in the RR-5 mission where samples were collected 30 days after flight. This finding is consistent with reports of sustained post-flight DDR activation from the NASA Twins study19. Notably, DNA damage in the skin has important implications for skin cancers including melanoma, of which astronauts carry a higher risk, although the direct correlation between spaceflight and melanoma is still under investigation95,96. Similarly, mitochondrial dysregulation is established as a key molecular signature of spaceflight78, and we see enrichment of an ISR pathway in all but two of the murine skin data subsets (Fig. 7a), which may be driven by increased oxidative stress or DNA damage. ISR activation appears to be impacted by spaceflight duration, as the 25 day time points for RR-7 show a suppression of the ISR pathway1,78. Using an explainable machine learning approach32, we also observed the counteractive mechanism played by D2HGDH, which was generally upregulated in space flown mice (Fig. 7b) indicating an increased need for breakdown of toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) molecules in mitochondria. In this model, the partner gene RPLP0-PS1 codes for the ribosomal protein RPLP0 and is down-regulated in space flown mice. RPLP0 has previously been implicated in the top significant network for the mitochondria-mediated cycle of Alzheimer’s disease97. Low or absent levels of RPLP0 seem to limit the compensatory mechanism in the model (Fig. 7b). If this occurs, build-up of D2H and suppression of certain enzyme functions can result, causing DNA and histones to enter hypermethylated states and activate oncogenes and inhibit tumor suppressors98. Build-up of D2H in the mitochondria may thus be related to cell changes induced by DNA damage from space radiation. Notably, gene regulatory changes associated with mitochondrial dysregulation and DDR were also reported in the skin data from the i4 mission17, corroborating these changes as key molecular hallmarks of spaceflight in the skin. The downregulation of collagen/ECM genes and the suppression of collagen/ECM-related pathways in the MHU-2 mouse mission, where spaceflight samples were collected shortly after landing (Figs. 2b and 5a), mirror findings from previous studies where a reduction in collagen synthesis occurred under hypergravity conditions in cultured human fibroblasts99. In contrast, RR-7 mice (frozen in space) generally exhibited an upregulation of the same collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a), consistent with results from the aforementioned human fibroblast study, which reported a 143% increase in collagen synthesis during microgravity99. Similar to RR-7, RR-5 also showed a trend of upregulation in collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a). The opposing patterns between the MHU-2 mission and RR-5/RR-7 may arise from diverse factors owing to experimental design differences. Notably, the timing of sample collection introduces a critical variable, as seen in the MHU-2 mission where samples were collected less than one day post-flight, in contrast to RR-5, where collection occurred after a 30-day post-flight recovery, and RR-7, where samples were obtained directly in space. This temporal distinction implies that collagen suppression observed in MHU-2 mice may be influenced, at least in part, by the acute hypergravity response, a known factor in decreasing collagen synthesis99, and the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids100–102, rather than being solely attributed to the spaceflight environment. Moreover, differences in sex and housing arrangements further complicate the comparison; MHU-2 mice are singly-housed males, while RR-5 and RR-7 mice are multi-housed females, introducing additional variables that may contribute to the observed disparities100–103. Skin has an anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile104. For instance, fibroblasts exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on their positional identity in relation to the major anatomical axis105. This phenomenon in part explains the predisposition of different sites to different skin conditions104. Although several genes related to collagen synthesis and ECM were downregulated across all four MHU-2 experimental groups, some of these genes showed statistical significance in the dorsal group but not in the femoral group (Fig. 5a). Likewise in the RR-5 mission, during terrestrial recovery, skin biopsies obtained from dorsal skin generally showed a higher reversal of gene expression pattern compared to those obtained from the femoral skin (Figs. 3a and 5a). These changes may be indicative of the variations in gene expression profile, their adaptation response to space flight and re-adaptation to terrestrial environment, at different anatomical sites. Skin biopsies collected from i4 astronauts one day post-flight exhibited a marked downregulation of various collagen/ECM-associated genes in the dermal layer compared to pre-flight conditions (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1) (Fig. 5b). However, certain genes, such as SPARC and COL3A1, showed an upregulation in one or both compartments of the epidermis (Fig. 5b). Moreover, several other collagen/ECM associated genes (e.g. COL14A1, COL15A1, MMP3) were upregulated in both epidermis and the dermis (Fig. 5b). As with the MHU-2 mice, the i4 astronauts’ skin biopsies were obtained one-day post-flight, so some of these effects may have been induced by hypergravity. Nevertheless, blood data obtained from the same i4 astronauts at 1-, 45-, and 82-days post-flight suggests that most gene alterations observed upon landing revert back to normal levels within 82 days following flight, so we may expect a similar response in the skin tissue (Supplementary Figs. 2c and 3c). Previously reported findings from the NASA Twins showed in-flight activation of collagen formation pathways and an increase in COL1A1 and COL3A1 proteins detected in the urine, indicative of structural remodeling19. These changes, as with the majority of spaceflight-induced changes, were also reported to revert to baseline post-flight19. Some of the changes reported by astronauts during and after spaceflight, such as dryness and contact dermatitis, point to an impaired barrier function17,95 our results support this hypothesis. FLG is a gene expressed in the stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis, during the epidermal differentiation process41. It encodes profilaggrin, a major component of keratohyalin granules found in the keratinocytes that is dephosphorylated and cleaved into filaggrin106,107. During conversion of keratinocyte cell membrane to cornified cell envelope, filaggrin aggregates and aligns intermediate filaments such as keratin 1 and keratin 10, within the cytoskeleton of keratinocytes, and subsequently a cross-linking process is initiated by proteins such as involucrin and locicrin108,109. This results in compactization and flattening of the corneocytes, one of the constituents of the skin barrier110. We identified FLG as one of the cross-mission genes in the spaceflight vs ground control mice data with downregulation across the majority of data subsets (all except RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we observed post-flight vs pre-flight downregulation of FLG in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b). Caspase-14, an enzyme encoded by the CASP14 gene, cleaves filaggrin, breaking it down into free amino acids. These amino acids serve as integral components of natural moisturizing factors, contributing to the preservation of skin hydration and pH111. Additionally, they play a crucial role in antimicrobial defense, further contributing to the multifaceted functions of the skin barrier61,112,113. Similar to FLG, CASP14 demonstrated downregulation in the majority of murine skin subsets (excluding RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a), the epidermal layer of i4 astronaut skin tissue (Fig. 5b), and JAXA hair follicles (Fig. 5c). This observation is important considering the crucial role CASP14 plays in skin barrier formation and its involvement in skin conditions such as contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis53,61,62,114. The link between filaggrin deficiency and dry skin, altered pH, atopic and contact dermatitis, and ichthyosis vulgaris is also well-known54,60,112,115–117. CASP14 was also the driver of one of the two main QLattice models we found to be maximally relevant and minimally redundant among the cross-mission genes, resulting in a very simple model involving only CASP14 and S1PR1 with an AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 3d). S1PR1 was upregulated in most murine skin subsets (Fig. 3a), the in-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b), and in all compartments for the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 astronauts’ skin samples (Fig. 4a). In the RR-5 mission, after a 30-day recovery, in-flight effects may have been reversed as S1PR1 expression was downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is also consistent with downregulation in the post-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b). Downregulation of S1PR1 has been reported to be necessary for activation of resident memory CD8 + T cells in skin35 and has previously been observed in CD8 + T cells from murine skin during response to Herpes Simplex Virus Infection118. While the S1P-S1PR axis has inhibitory roles in keratinocyte proliferation, it was also shown to contribute to the process of chemotaxis119. For instance, in Staphylococcus-aureus-stimulated keratinocytes; TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-36γ release was induced via involvement of S1PR1 and S1PR2120. Higher expression levels of S1PR1 and S1PR2 observed in the skin of impetigo patients and changes in the distribution patterns of these receptors were also aligned with these findings120. Herpes Simplex Virus reactivation3,4,95 and Staphylococcus colonization in the skin10,17,121 (which could also be influenced by breakdown of filaggrin altering pH levels122) have been widely reported in astronauts, therefore alterations in S1PR1, CASP14, and FLG, are of importance. At present, there is a lack of widely accepted countermeasures to effectively mitigate the damage caused to the skin induced by exposure to the space environment. Our analysis has identified drugs capable of altering similar molecular changes that manifest in the skin during spaceflight (Fig. 9). Several drugs, including calcitriol, tretinoin, and tamoxifen showed significant positive correlation with regulatory changes in all data subsets from the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions except for the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point (Fig. 9). Tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative is a retinoid known for its applications in treating acne and leukemia, exerts its effects through the activation of retinoic acid receptors, influencing various skin processes such as increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation of epidermal cells, increased keratinocyte turnover, increased collagen synthesis, inhibited UV radiation induced metalloproteinase activity, and melanin reduction23,123,124. Tretinoin treatment on reconstructed human epidermis was shown to induce loss of keratohyalin granules and reduce filaggrin and Keratin 10 expression125. Retinoids have also been observed to downregulate caspase-14 expression in in-vitro reconstructed skin models126. Dry skin and exfoliation are common side effects during its use123. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to exhibit both agoniztic and antagonistic effects depending on the tissue94. Its use in breast cancer patients is linked to cutaneous adverse events, including dry skin, itching, and occasionally radiation recall dermatitis and baboon syndrome (a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction)126–129. Furthermore, tamoxifen induces androgen receptor expression in hair follicles, leading to tamoxifen-induced alopecia in some cases130, and abnormal hair follicles, epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis have been observed in rat models131. On the other hand, only olaparib, estrogen, and diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic form of estrogen) showed an opposing pattern, with significant negative correlation in all data subsets except for those from the RR-5 mission and the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point of the RR-7 mission (Fig. 9). Estrogen plays a crucial role in skin health, influencing keratinocyte function, collagen production, moisture retention and telogen-anagen follicle transition132–135. In an explant model of fetal rat skin development, estrogen was shown to increase filaggrin expression136. Conversely, estrogen deficiency during menopause is associated with adverse skin changes such as loss of collagen, skin dryness and atrophy137,138. Overall, molecular alterations observed in the space flown mice and astronaut skin data show similarities with molecular effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen123, such as FLG and CASP14 downregulation, while symptoms reported in astronauts including dry skin and dermatitis also resemble side effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen106 (Fig. 9). Topical moisturizers and emollients, as commonly used by astronauts15,95, may help to counteract the physiological consequences of disrupted barrier function genes, and may also help to explain why results on impact of spaceflight on skin physiological parameters in astronauts have been mixed14,15, despite physiological evidence of skin damage in space flown rodents12. In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight on skin health. Currently, there is a gap in knowledge for how space radiation and microgravity affects skin biology, yet many of the common themes of spaceflight dysfunction emerged in our analysis, suggesting that skin could be an easily-accessible candidate for studying the biological impact of spaceflight. Our systems biology analysis revealed some genes of interest and potential mechanisms to investigate in the context of countermeasures that can be utilized in future studies. We believe with our study we have started to address the current gaps and provided some clues on how to potentially mitigate the adverse effects of the space environment to the skin. The rodent datasets used come from three different spaceflight experiments with a variety of confounding variables associated with differences in study design. This means that direct comparison between the experiments is challenging, but indeed this also presents an opportunity to hypothesize how these factors may influence biology, as done in this manuscript. A lack of physiological data, such as dermal thickness, and lack of individual skin layer data from the rodent datasets means that generated hypotheses relating to mouse physiology cannot be confirmed without follow-up investigations, but the comparison to astronaut data helps translate the results to human relevance. Lastly, gene expression levels differ between skin compartments so an identical fold-change value in a layer where the specific gene expression is generally low may not represent the same magnitude in a layer where the same gene’s expression is relatively greater. As such, for the i4 skin data we focused on changes in the compartments where the gene is established to be predominantly expressed.Supplementary information Peer Review File (3.6MB, pdf) Supplementary information (888.6KB, pdf) 43856_2024_532_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (7.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (34.4MB, csv) Supplementary Data 2 (20.6MB, xls) Supplementary Data 3 (65.1KB, csv) Supplementary Data 4 (1.3MB, docx) Reporting Summary (1.8MB, pdf) Acknowledgements H.C. is supported by the Horizon Center for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham (UKRI grant no.

Microbiomes play a significant role in shaping host physiology, adaptation, fitness, and even behavior (1–4). Organisms and their microbial inhabitants share their first interactions at the integument of the host (5). This enveloping layer, whether it be skin, membranes, or a cuticle, plays an essential role in host–microbe relationships and may act as a barrier to promote host survival. These essential roles coupled with dynamic microbial communities provide a valuable interface to study host–microbe interactions (6). Emerging studies specifically focus on the effects of single, pathogenic bacteria, which are often localized to the gut, on animal behavior and physiology (7–10). Although single-species studies allow a thorough investigation of host–microbe interactions, individual microbial species do not fully recapitulate entire communities of microbes (11). Moreover, a majority of these studies focus on pathogen invasion mechanisms of the skin or pathogen–commensal microbial interactions (12), whereas host–commensal dynamics at the skin surface remain impactful but understudied (5, 13). This is also the case for the soil- and fruit-dwelling nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Despite the subtle implication of surface-adherent bacteria, host–microbe interaction studies at the surface layer are often focused on pathogens (14–16). In the wild, C. elegans are found in rotting organic matter filled with microorganisms (17–19). Therefore, an interaction between external microbes and the worm’s integument—the cuticle—is inevitable and likely a dynamic process (20), Moreover, these nematodes rely on their cuticle health to protect against environmental stressors such as harmful toxins (21), desiccants (22), or pathogens (23, 24). The function of the C. elegans cuticle and its many structures have been explored using mutants in the underlying genes. Animals with defective cuticle structures display a number of phenotypes including motor abnormalities, a higher susceptibility to chemically induced cuticle degradation, and protection from skin pathogens (25–28). Several modes of fungal and single-bacterial adherence and pathogenesis have been characterized (14–16), including Leucobacter strains known to externally invade C. elegans surfaces (15, 29). However, interactions involving ecologically relevant commensals and, moreover, communities of microbes that represent wild C. elegans encounters remain underexplored. Nematodes are maintained on bacterial lawns in laboratory settings. Together with their genetic tools and transparent bodies, C. elegans have recently gained attention in microbiome studies (30, 31). In the laboratory setting, a single bacterium Escherichia coli (usually a single strain, OP50) serves as the animal’s food source and external environment and minimally colonizes the C. elegans intestine for most of its life (32). However, E. coli is not a substitute for a microbiome of C. elegans nor is it extensively associated with the nematode in the wild. A recent meta-analysis of the C. elegans intestinal microbiota produced a comprehensive analysis of the host’s natural gut inhabitants (17–19). This collaborative effort prompted the creation of the C. elegans microbiome (CeMbio), a model microbiome consisting of the 12 most abundant gut bacteria families naturally associated with C. elegans (33). Individual isolates from this consortium are known to affect growth, food choice behavior, and physiology, as well neural degradation through metabolite secretion (34–38). However, these studies only consider the influence and composition of CeMbio bacteria in the gut and have not examined their potential impact at other body sites, like the cuticle. In preparation for intestinal microbial sequencing, animals are traditionally subjected to harsh bleach washes and surface-sterilization protocols to remove cuticle-resident bacteria (39). Moreover, the first study using CeMbio intensified previously established washing steps to more effectively remove bacteria that were hypothesized to still remain on the surface, even after washing multiple times (33). The examination of nematode microbiomes in the absence of stringent surface bleach sterilization may provide worthwhile insights into the effects of a comprehensive, complex, and natural microbiome on cuticle physiology and host biology. To investigate the persistence, existence, and composition of a cuticle-resident microbiome, we develop a novel micro-swabbing tool in combination with bacterial growth curves to investigate if animals reared on a complex microbiome harbor cuticle-resident bacteria. To supplement this finding, we enumerate the abundance of bacteria on surface-sterilized animals to demonstrate that surface-sterilization protocols remove a significant number of skin-resident or associated bacteria. We then conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize a skin microbiome on animals reared on complex microbiomes similar to CeMbio, which we call modified CeMbio (mCeMbio, Table 1). Importantly, we find that the microbiome of non-sterilized C. elegans is microbially distinct from the microbiome of the C. elegans gut and the surrounding environment. We identify skin- and gut-dominant isolates of this microbial consortium that demonstrate distinct attachment strengths to the cuticle. Finally, we show that colonization with mCeMbio and with several mCeMbio isolates confers protection for the host against noxious stimuli. TABLE 1.

However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal’s microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-washing steps (Fig. 1A). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as “bleaching,” removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 (Fig. 1B). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<103 bacteria per worm, Fig. 1B). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<104 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>106 bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes.

This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal (Fig. 1C). To eliminate non-adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (“crawl”) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin-associated OP50 bacteria (Fig. 1D; Fig. S1A and C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals (Fig. 1E). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B and D). Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had ~7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on the C. elegans cuticle that are removed by standard bleach-based surface-sterilization protocols.Surface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria, suggesting distinct surface-resident communities We sought to define the species of mCeMbio bacteria that reside on the C. elegans cuticle and determine whether they are distinct from the microbiota of the gut and the surrounding environment. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleached C. elegans, serially washed C. elegans, and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experiments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels of Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, while unbleached animals contain more Enterobacter sp. JUb101 and Sphingobacterium multivorum BIGb0170 (Fig. 2A through C). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in microbiota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns (Fig. 2E and F). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by Bray–Curtis distances (PERMANOVA, Fig. 2G and I). Furthermore, within-sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washed C. elegans in experiment 2 (Fig. 2H and J). Our data suggest that the composition of the C. elegans skin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8-day-old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8-day-old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota of C. elegans with an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of the C. elegans gut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut-specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin-specific.

JUb101 is the only predominantly skin-resident microbe on which C. elegans develop at similar rates to those of OP50 and mCeMbio ((33) and our observations), and JUb19 is the gut-resident microbe with the highest relative abundance (Fig. 2C and D). As in Fig. 1, we performed CFU analysis on the microbes of interest in this study. We observe more CFUs from lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb101 (>106 bacteria per worm) than lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb19 (<105 bacteria per worm) (Fig. 3A). There is no statistically significant difference between the number of CFUs from lysates of serially washed or bleached animals reared on JUb19, although JUb19 is still found on the surface. This is indicated by ~104 CFU per worm found in and on serially washed animals, compared to the ~102 CFU per worm found in bleached animals (Fig. 3A). Conversely, in animals raised on JUb101, there is a statistically significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (~102 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>106 bacteria per worm), indicating the presence of JUb101 as a persistent and abundant skin-resident microbe that is removed with surface-sterilization protocols, but not serial washes (Fig. 3A). To account for free-living bacteria that are loosely attached to the cuticle or transient within the worm, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants following serial washes. We observe that JUb101 and JUb19 are both present in these supernatants, but in lower abundance when compared to washed groups. Fig 3.

Error bars are SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.To directly compare JUb19 and JUb101 as putative gut and skin-resident microbes, respectively, we swabbed animals reared on JUb19, JUb101, or CBX151. We include CBX151 (Leucobacter celer subsp. astrifaciens, Verde1) as a control bacterium that is known to strongly adhere to the C. elegans cuticle (44). We hypothesized that the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed skin-resident bacteria should more closely resemble those of CBX151 and mCeMbio animals (Fig. 1G), whereas the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed gut-resident bacteria should resemble those of OP50 (Fig. 1E). As expected, swabs from animals reared on CBX151 grow regardless of the number of washes (Fig. 3B). After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (“crawl”), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed (Fig. 3C; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes (Fig. 3D). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101-reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101-reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals (Fig. 3E; Fig. S3C and D). Conversely, swabs from animals reared on JUb19 indicate that bacterial growth from unwashed “crawl” animals is distinct from animals washed once or thrice (Fig. 3F and G). Swabs from JUb19 animals washed once or thrice are indistinguishable from swabs of bleached animals (Fig. 3G; Fig. S3E and F). Together, the patterns observed in JUb101 growth curves resemble those of CBX151, suggesting that JUb101 is also likely a cuticle-resident microbe.CeMbio bacteria promote wildtype and mutant C. elegans cuticle integrity Given that mCeMbio contains both skin- and gut-resident bacteria, with variable strengths of attachment on the nematode cuticle, we sought to observe a potential role for skin-adherent bacteria. We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX151 as a known skin-adherent control) would protect animals from noxious environments more than gut-associated ones (JUb19 and MYb71). To test this, we performed a cuticle resistance assay by treating animals with a harsh (5%) bleach solution (Fig. 4A). In this assay, the time to burst is a readout of cuticle integrity and a potential indication of the protective roles that bacteria may have on worm physiology (45, 46). We found that wild-type animals reared on CBX151 and mCeMbio community take significantly longer to burst compared to OP50 controls and therefore exhibit greater cuticle resistance (Fig. 4B). Animals were also reared on mCeMbio isolates individually, and we observed a range of impacts on cuticle integrity. Some bacterial species, including gut-resident Ochrobactrum MYb71, significantly promoted cuticle integrity with longer times to burst. Other bacteria, including the skin-associated JUb101 and gut-associated JUb19, did not alter animal burst times compared to OP50. Sphingomonas JUb134 was the only mCeMbio strain to significantly decrease host cuticle integrity, further supporting that most mCeMbio strains are nonpathogenic in this context (33). However, neither JUb101 nor JUb19 consistently change C. elegans cuticle burst time on their own (Fig. 4B). This suggests that interspecies interactions present in mCeMbio may promote cuticle protection or the N2 wildtype C. elegans strain lacks sensitivity in this assay and masks the subtle impact on the cuticle.

We tested animals with mutations in cuticle-related genes: bus-8, dpy-8, srf-3, and dpy-10 (Fig. S4A; Table S1). All genes are known to affect cuticle integrity. Bus-8 is predicted to encode a glycosyltransferase, enabling proper cuticle molts and leading to disordered epidermal morphogenesis in strong mutants (26, 45). Dpy-8 and dpy-10 are collagen genes that, upon disruption, cause loss of cuticular annuli structures (27). Srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter, and mutants have altered cuticle surface compositions that confer biofilm resistance (28). Previous studies have demonstrated bus-8 (e2698) mutants as more sensitive (45) in the cuticle resistance assay, while dpy-10 mutants have been shown to be more stiff than wild-type animals (47) and express the innate immune gene nlp-29 at high levels constitutively (48), while also being more permeable to a Hoescht staining protocol (27), suggesting a multifaceted role for dpy-10 in protection and permeability. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared bus-8 mutants are significantly shorter (time to burst = 25 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds), as previously observed in literature (45) (Fig. 4C and D; Fig. S4A). Despite a disordered epidermal morphology and disrupted cuticle integrity in bus-8 animals, mCeMbio consistently promotes cuticle integrity (time to burst = 39 seconds) compared to OP50 (time to burst = 25 seconds) (Fig. 4D). To normalize across multiple experiments and variable times to burst, we evaluated the fold change in burst time compared to animals raised on OP50. We observed significant differences in the fold change in burst time of bus-8 animals raised on mCeMbio and JUb19 compared to animals raised on OP50, with mCeMbio providing 1.4-fold increases in burst time and JUb19 providing a 1.3-fold increase; JUb101 does not significantly increase the fold change in burst time but shows variability between experiments (Fig. S4B through D). Interestingly, the cuticle-adherent CBX151 caused either parental death or suppressed growth in bus-8 animals, preventing us from testing this condition consistently in this cuticle mutant background. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared dpy-10 mutants are significantly longer (time to burst = 145 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds) (Fig. 4C and E). Dpy-10 animals raised on CBX151 (time to burst = 457 seconds), mCeMbio (time to burst = 302 seconds), JUb19 (time to burst = 219 seconds), or JUb101 (time to burst = 291 seconds) display noticeably longer cuticle burst times compared to dpy-10 animals raised on OP50 (time to burst = 145 seconds) (Fig. 4E). This relationship is consistent with the fold change over OP50 observed for animals raised on CBX151 (3.9-fold), mCeMbio (2.3-fold), JUb19 (1.9-fold), and JUb101 (2.2-fold) (Fig. S4D). Given the consistency of increased cuticle integrity in both wild-type and cuticle mutants reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50, bacteria–bacteria interactions likely impact C. elegans bleach sensitivity. Moreover, dpy-10 mutants reared on JUb101 or JUb19 promote cuticle protection compared to OP50, unmasking a subtle yet consistent impact of these bacteria on the cuticle. Despite being a single species, CBX151 is also a consistent promoter of cuticle integrity, suggesting a role for adherence to cuticle structures still present on dpy-10 and bus-8 mutants. Interestingly, these cuticle structures may be critical for the adherence of some of the mCeMbio strains. We performed 16S sequencing on these sensitized strains to observe the composition of mCeMbio species present on the surfaces of the C. elegans mutants. We show the composition of serially washed (unbleached) bus-8, dpy-10, dpy-8, and srf-3 mutants compared to wild-type controls collected alongside them. We observe that bus-8, dpy-10, dpy-8, and srf-3 mutants all display reduced abundance of JUb101, the candidate skin-adherent bacterial species in this study (Fig. S4E and F). Moreover, bus-8, dpy-8, and srf-3 mutants have increased abundance of JUb19, the putative gut-resident microbe in this study (Fig. S4E and F). These results allow us to begin to associate some cuticle structures with bacterial adherence.DISCUSSION Bacteria–host interactions are complex and known to impact many aspects of host biology. Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover a C. elegans skin-resident microbiome. We reared animals on a natural C. elegans microbiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface (Fig. 1A and B). We observed that our surface-sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings (33), whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria (Fig. 1B and 3A). We conjectured that there are abundant skin-resident bacteria, approximating counts from simplified arithmetic of [# unbleached CFU] – [# bleached CFU] – [# supernatant CFU] (Fig. 1A). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro-swab to isolate skin microbes from C. elegans cuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria from C. elegans cuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions (Fig. 1D through G); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface-adherent bacteria. We then conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to define strain-level microbial differences among serially washed and bleached animals. From these data emerged candidate gut- (Stenotrophomonas JUb19 and Ochrobactrum MYb71) and skin-dominant bacteria (Enterobacter JUb101 and Sphingobacterium BIGb0170). Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes (Fig. 2C through J; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle-adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns (Fig. 2G and I), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely attached bacteria, is similar to or distinct from the environment or animal surface, we focused on the more strongly attached bacteria. We further confirmed the persistence of skin-resident microbes compared to more gut-resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species (Fig. 3D through G). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with the C. elegans cuticle to varying degrees. None of the mCeMbio bacteria are known to be pathogenic, although the individual isolates demonstrate varying effects on host developmental rates (33). Given the symbiotic nature of these bacteria and our parallel lines of validation of surface-adherent bacteria, we hypothesized that the mCeMbio community serves a role in cuticle protection against environmental stressors. We conducted a well-established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle-adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio (Fig. 4A and B). From these data, we demonstrate the importance of studying community effects and the effects of single bacterial species on cuticle integrity. Put together, we uncover a protective effect for animals reared on a consortium of ecologically relevant bacteria. The data from our study do not differentiate between the combinatorial effects of the mCeMbio bacteria on the skin and in the gut, and the mechanism of this protection requires further examination. Several species of bacteria found in association with C. elegans are known to, directly and indirectly, protect against pathogens in the worm intestine (49). Other protective benefits may be derived from diverse nutritional or metabolic mechanisms unique to the mCeMbio bacteria (33). This may provide an indirect mechanism by which gut-dominant bacteria, like MYb71, are able to protect the cuticle. Moreover, both known skin-resident bacteria and members of the mCeMbio consortium have been shown to prime the cuticle against other infections (50). This protection may even be attributed to the potential hydrogen peroxide-degrading capabilities of the mCeMbio consortium, which have been observed in strains of E. coli (51). Importantly, we sought to examine skin-enriched microbes and the mCeMbio consortium as a whole, which involves both bacteria–bacteria and host–bacteria interactions. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst = 277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut-enriched strain Ochrobactrum MYb71 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that most single host–bacteria interactions may not fully recapitulate the extent of interactions in our system and demonstrates the importance of studying communities of ecologically relevant microbes. In an effort to develop C. elegans as a model for understanding skin and associated diseases, we must make use of sensitized and protective strains. To do this, we used C. elegans mutants with varying levels of disordered cuticle structure and function. We found that mCeMbio, JUb19, JUb101, as well as the known skin-adherent microbe CBX151 increase protection in nearly all sensitized and protective mutants (Fig. 4C through E; Fig. S4A through D; Table 2). However, we have not confirmed that these mutant animals can be vessels for bacterial growth on their skin, given their disrupted state. We see effects on these sensitized mutants and correlate those effects to the presence of skin microbes. It is also plausible that, similar to our findings in wild-type animals, these effects could be due to nutritional supplementation from mCeMbio bacteria or otherwise mediated through the gut.

Set 1 is shown in Fig. 4C through E. All data are shown in Fig. S4 B through D. b NA, Not available because that group was not tested in that individual experiment. Interestingly, the washed (unbleached) C. elegans with mutations in cuticle genes display 16S profiles different from those of the washed (unbleached) wild-type animals. These differences are most starkly observed in the decreased abundance of putative skin-adherent microbe, JUb101, and increased presence of JUb19 across nearly all of the sensitized cuticle mutant strains. We do not have data for bleached cuticle mutant strains; due to their sensitized nature, the standard bleaching protocol was too harsh for most of the animals. Therefore, we are unable to compare between washed and bleached conditions. However, we observe that mCeMbio is able to rescue the cuticle mutants, which suggests that even small populations of the strains are protective or that the protection comes from aforementioned indirect influences. Given the symbiotic nature of the mCeMbio bacteria, which includes 11/12 published CeMbio strains; unique cuticle structures of the nematode skin such as the annuli, alae, or invagination sites; and community effects on promoting barrier function, our data support the existence of and role for a previously unappreciated C. elegans skin microbiome. Our work supports the continued efforts to make the study of C. elegans more ecologically relevant and suggests that we continue to understand and increase environmental enrichment to improve the relevance of this model system.MATERIALS AND METHODS C. elegans strains and maintenance Strains were ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and include the following: wild-type N2; CB130 dpy-8 (e130); VC2985 dpy-10 (gk3075) II; CB6627 srf-3 (e2689) IV; CB6177 bus-8 (e2883) X. All animals were grown at 20°C under standard conditions to adulthood (52). NGM plates were seeded with either E. coli OP50 or mCeMbio strains, unless noted of a specific bacterium. For all experiments, L4 animals are placed on lawns and removed ~12 hours later, leaving only offspring behind. Experiments are then performed on the offspring, unless otherwise noted.Culture and maintenance of mCeMbio bacteria Individual isolates of “CeMBio” bacteria, referred to as mCeMbio (gift from H. Schulenberg, available now through CGC as CeMbio, see note below in Identification of mCeMbio) and CBX151 (a gift from Marie-Anne Félix), were streaked onto LB agar plates, and individual colonies were picked and grown in LB growth media. Individual bacteria (12 mCeMbio strains, CBX151, and OP50) were allowed to grow for 2–4 days, with shaking at 4 x g at 20°C. Bacteria were maintained and prepared to OD600 = 0.2 by dilution in additional LB or centrifuging at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes to remove excess LB to increase the concentration of slow-growing isolates. To make mCeMbio, each of the 12 bacteria were combined at equal ratios. Two hundred microliters of the bacteria was pipetted on 6-cm NGM plates and evenly spread across the agar plate using a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007–358). Bacterial plates were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 2 days. If not used immediately, seeded plates were stored at 4°C. We maintain glycerol stocks of each bacterium at −80°C, and these were used for each new batch of each mCeMbio strain, OP50, or CBX151 bacteria.Identification of mCeMbio strain JUb101 The Lelliottia amnigena, JUb66, genome sequenced in Houston by Buck Samuel’s group and the JUb66 genome sequenced in Kiel by Heinrich Schulenburg’s group are different. The bacterial sample deposited at the CGC as part of the CeMbio consortium is the JUb66 from the Samuel Lab (JUb66 Houston), and the one from the Schulenburg lab is now known as JUb101. We acquired our strains from the Schulenburg lab. These two genomes have identical 16S rRNA representative sequences and the same number of 16S repeats. A whole-genome comparison of JUb66 Houston and JUb101 (formerly known as JUb66 Kiel) shows only 84% similarity. To determine the identity of our CeMbio strain, formerly known as JUb66 Kiel, we used the following PCR primers and standard NEB Taq protocols. JUb66-2270F TTGCTTCGGGTGGTGGTATC JUb66-2827R CCATGGAACTCACCCCTGTC JUb101-1377F GAGGATGGGTATGCAGACCG JUb101-2375R GGGATCGCAATCTGACGGAT Therefore, we call our mixture mCeMbio, a modified CeMbio consortium. C. elegans and bacterial prep for DNA extraction Animals were reared on mCeMbio bacterial lawns for 48–82 hours after hatching. Bacterial plates (n = 3 for each group) were flooded with M9 and 30 animals were picked off with a glass pipette and placed into an Eppendorf tube. For unbleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T [M9 +25 mM tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich L9756)] five times, allowing 4 minutes for animals to sink to the bottom of the tubes between each wash. For bleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T two times and then washed with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH) for 4 minutes. These tubes were rinsed with M9 +T twice for 4 minutes each. After washes, animals were allowed to sink to the bottom of the tube. All but 100 µL of media was removed in the final wash, and the tubes were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. For “lawn” plates, 1 mL of M9 was added to the plate, and the bacterial lawns were scraped with a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007–358). Bacterial slurry was pipetted and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 4 minutes. All but 100 µL was removed, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. DNA was extracted following the standard NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel 740952) protocol for animal tissue with 1 hour of incubation for the first lysis step. DNA was stored at −20°C.16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis For each experiment, an amplicon library targeting the V4–V5 hypervariable region of the 16S gene was generated via one-step PCR using the Azura TruFi DNA Polymerase PCR kit, and the 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primer set was used (53). Each reaction was performed with an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 56°C for 15 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Two and a half microliters of each PCR reaction was run on a 1.8% agarose gel to confirm amplification. PCR products were purified using Beckman Coulter AMPure XP following the standard 1 x PCR clean-up protocol. PCR quantification was performed in duplicate using the Invitrogen Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit. Samples were then pooled in equal proportions (20 ng DNA per sample), followed by another AMPure XP PCR purification. The final libraries were evaluated on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (D1000 ScreenTape), quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit, and each library was sequenced at the University of California, San Diego IGM Genomics Center on a single Illumina MiSeq lane with a 25% PhiX spike-in. Amplicons were analyzed with QIIME2 v2019.10 (54). Briefly, demultiplexed paired-end reads were trimmed to remove adapter and primer sequences with cutadapt (55). Trimmed reads were then denoised with DADA2 to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) (56). Taxonomic annotation of ASVs was conducted with the q2-feature-classifier classify-sklearn naïve-bayes classifier (57, 58), both the genome-derived reference 16S sequences of CeMbio strains (33) and the SILVA database (v138) (59). ASVs were then aggregated by the bacterial strain, and reads were normalized by the 16S gene copy numbers estimated by their genome assemblies (33). Bray–Curtis dissimilarities, Shannon indices, and tests of statistical significance were then calculated with the QIIME2 diversity plugin on the normalized relative abundance count data (60, 61). Raw sequence data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the BioProject accession PRJNA979901. Data are sorted into experiment 1 and experiment 2 “combine,” in which all wild-type, hermaphrodite samples, regardless of date of extraction or age, were included if they met the category “bleached” or “unbleached” (serially washed). These data are displayed in Fig. 2 and sorted by experiment. Fig. S2 displays data from combining experiment 1 and experiment 2, but only the samples in which the bleached and unbleached (serially washed) samples were prepared as a matched set on the same day and at day 1 of adulthood.Skin-swabbing with the 96-well plate assay To prepare the micro-swab, a glass capillary tube (World Precision Instrument Thin Wall Glass Capillaries-TW100-4 or similar) was pulled apart over a small flame into two pieces. Heat was used to create a small closed bulb at the pulled end of each piece, ensuring there were no crevices in which bacteria or liquids may accumulate, and then the glass was allowed to cool. Then, using 600-grain sandpaper, the bulb was lightly scored to make a textured surface (~10 small circles on each side and tip). To sterilize, the swab is dipped in 70% ethanol and air-dried. To swab a lawn, the micro-swab is dipped into the lawn on which the animals were reared and then immediately swirled in the appropriate LB-containing wells. To swab an animal with the condition “crawl,” a single animal is placed on an empty NGM agar plate using an eyelash pick and allowed to crawl for 30 seconds. Using a dissecting microscope, the animal was gently swabbed using the bulbous end from head to tail 10 times. The bulb was then dipped and swirled around in 10 circles into 200 µL of LB in a 96-well plate (CoStar 96 Flat Black). Animals that were washed once “1 x wash” were washed in M9 +T and allowed to sink to the bottom of a tube. This was repeated two more times for “3 x wash.” For animals in the “bleach” group, they were first washed with M9 +T three times, then once with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH), and once more with M9 +T. Once washed or bleached, the animals were then pipetted onto a sterile NGM plate in a small volume and allowed to crawl out of the drop before being swabbed. Once all animals were swabbed, the OD600 was measured using a Molecular Devices SpectraMaxPlus with absorbance = 600 nm, manually taking measurements during standard work hours. To generate the curves in Fig. 1D, F and 3B, D and F ,Fig. S1A through D and Fig. S3A through F, the individual replicate OD600 values at each timepoint were averaged in each condition within an experiment. Our methods make use of area under the curve analyses, which can be used to compare and quantify data from multiple growth curves (62, 63).Colony-Forming Unit assay Animals were reared to day 1 of adulthood on chosen bacteria. Fifty adult worms were transferred to a 2-mL tube containing 100 µL M9 and 10–20 1 mm zirconium beads (Beadbug Z763780). Each tube of worms was washed three times for 3 minutes each with 750 µL M9 +tetramisole (25 mM), removing all but 100 µL liquid with a new pipette tip each time, allowing animals to sink to the bottom of the tube by gravity. We separated half of the tubes to be “bleached” groups, which are subjected to a 4-minute wash with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH). Bleached animals are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T to remove the bleach. On the final wash, 100 µL of the supernatant from each bleached tube is removed. Unbleached samples are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T, and 100 µL of the supernatant is removed for each unbleached tube. Each sample is homogenized using a Fisher Mixer Mill at Level 4 for 30 seconds for four cycles, totaling 2 minutes of bead beating. The homogenate was then serially diluted (1 in 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 for each tube of 50 worms) in M9. One hundred microliters of each dilution was plated and spread with a sterile L spreader on LB agar plates. The previously removed supernatants were also diluted in M9 and plated. Plates were dried and left to grow for 48 hours. Finally, bacterial colonies were counted to quantify the original bacterial colony counts in each sample (unbleached, bleached, and supernatant of both bleached and unbleached samples).Cuticle fragility assay Fifteen microliters of strong bleach solution (1M KOH and ~5% hypochlorite) is pipetted onto a single day 1 adult animal after it has crawled on a clean NGM plate for ~10 seconds. Under a dissecting microscope, the time to burst open (cuticle loses integrity) is recorded.Standard statistical analyses Fig. 1, 3, 4; Fig. S1 to S4 and their statistical analyses were completed in GraphPad Prism. Ungrouped two-sample t-tests were used when determining the statistical significance during comparisons of two groups. With three groups and more, an ANOVA test was performed for determining significance values. When appropriate, corrections were performed for multiple comparisons or unequal variances. Any P value smaller than 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical tests used in Fig. 2 are described under “16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing and Analysis.”ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the Chalasani lab members, especially Kirthi Reddy, for their support and feedback on this nascent project.

    "abstract": "Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Subject terms: Cytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria",
    "introduction": "Introduction Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9. unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11 (WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genome contains a single unc-89 gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26. Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability of C. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication.",

    "results": "Results Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected to result in instability A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST confirmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinases). The DMT class takes its name from their representative Death-associated-protein kinases (DAPKs), Myosin light-chain-kinases (MLCKs), and Triple functional domain protein-related kinases (TRIO) and contains, in addition, various muscle kinases including human titin kinase, nematode twitchin kinase (TwcK) and mammalian obscurin and SPEG kinases32. The BLAST search revealed that PK2 shares the highest sequence identity levels with DAPKs, TwcK, and MLCK (Supplementary Fig. 1). DAPK, TwcK, and MLCK kinases are proven to be catalytically active and their phosphotransfer has been characterized33–35. Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Specifically, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involved in ATP-binding, an AAK motif in β-strand β3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms a salt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committed state of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residue chelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartate and a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordination), both in the catalytic loop motif36,37. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK1138, TP53RK39, and mouse obscurin PK228 contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively. Fig. 1.

Bottom right: confirmation of the CRISPR/Cas9 generated aag to gcc sequence change in unc-89(sf22) which specifies a K7816A mutation in PK2. Bottom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs. unc-89(sf22). The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are ~800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspecific reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies46.During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC-89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness36. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement31,32. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable, we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldX v441. This yielded a calculated comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, of −0.15 kcal/mol and indicated that no significant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. To summarize, UNC-89-PK2 is modeled by Alphafold in a catalytically-primed conformational state compatible with kinase activity, the active site comprises the essential functional groups necessary for phosphor-transfer and the introduced mutation is not expected to cause structural instability. Taken together, bioinformatics analysis indicates that UNC-89-PK2 is a canonical, active kinase and that the observed nematode phenotype in this work results from hindered phosphor-transfer by PK2 resulting from the inactivating KtoA mutation. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move faster than wild-type nematodes We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm (Fig. 1d), unc-89(sf22), in which PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-target mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody10. Surprisingly, unlike all other unc-89 mutants, unc-89(sf22) worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostaining using antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for the base of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, and F-actin for I-bands (Fig. 2a–c). Detection and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, the normal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major loss of the mutant UNC-89 protein. To examine the myofilament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As shown in Fig. 2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres in unc-89(sf22) and in unc-89(syb1360), a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin filaments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Fig. 2. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure. Open in a new tab a The drawing on the right shows a cross-section through an adult worm indicating that the body wall muscle is organized into four quadrants. Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells (23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myofilament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick filaments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin filaments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs). The black oval indicates the plane viewed when an animal, lying on a glass slide, is examined by light microscopy as shown in part (c).

Note that there is no difference in the pattern of localization of these sarcomeric markers between wild type and unc-89(sf22). Scale bars, 10 μm. d Transmission EM of body wall muscle from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and a second independently-generated PK2 KtoA mutant, unc-89(syb1360). Bottom row displays the enlargement of one portion of the image above it. Yellow arrows, M-lines; yellow arrowheads, dense bodies, green arrows, SR. There is no discernible difference between the wild type and the two mutants in terms of numbers and organization of thick and thin filaments, M-lines, dense bodies, and SR. Scale bars, 0.5 μm.Because deficiency of mouse obscurin23 and worm UNC-8924 result in disorganized SR, we examined SR organization using the marker UNC-68 (Ryanodine receptor). However, HA-tagged UNC-68 endogenously expressed from a CRISPR/Cas9 strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a), or myc-tagged UNC-68 overexpressed from a transgene (Supplementary Fig. 4b) show normal localization in unc-89(sf22). Obscurin is also required for normal microtubule organization42. However, we found no difference in microtubule organization comparing wild type vs. unc-89(sf22), using a transgenic line expressing TBA-1 (α-tubulin) tagged with HA (Supplementary Fig. 5). unc-89 is also expressed in the single sarcomere muscle cells of the pharynx. UNC-89 is normally localized to the middle of the A-bands of pharyngeal sarcomeres8,10. All previously characterized unc-89 mutants, except for unc-89(tm752), have abnormally organized filaments as observed by polarized light or immunostaining6,9,11, with characteristic arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, both unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) display normal pharyngeal muscle as assessed by staining with anti-UNC-89 and the pharyngeal muscle-specific MHC C. Nearly all previously characterized unc-89 mutants have reduced whole animal locomotion and generate reduced maximal force9, most likely because sarcomere disorganization results in reduced muscle activity. The one known exception is unc-89(ad539), but this mutant only affects the organization of the pharyngeal muscle. Two independently derived UNC-89 KtoA mutants, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360), crawl faster than wild-type worms on an agar surface (Fig. 3a), and generate the same amount of maximal force43 as wild type (Fig. 3b).

Nematodes expressing UNC-89 PK2 KtoA, or an unc-89 mutant lacking expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, have fragmented mitochondria Blondelle et al.30 created a mouse doubly knocked out for both obscurin and obsl1 and demonstrated that by proteome analysis, these mice have changes in metabolic pathways, including decreased levels of nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others44. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105)45 have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms8,11(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig2624,46, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig3946, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria. Fig. 4. Body wall muscle cells of UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Open in a new tab a Confocal images of body wall muscle stained with antibodies to ATP5A to reveal the morphology of mitochondria. Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as “tubular”. In contrast, unc-89(sf22) which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, and unc-89(tm752) which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear as dots or can be described as fragmented. By comparison, unc-89(e1460) which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, and unc-89(su75) which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear more tubular or more like wild type. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicated strains. Note the presence of linear or tubular mitochondria in wild type and unc-89(e1460) and fragmented mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752). c, d Three additional independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutants (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) show fragmented mitochondria. Scale bars, 10 μm in (a and c); 5 μm in (b and d).Because CRISPR/Cas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change. sf22 and sf24 are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, and syb1195 and syb1360 are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type. The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation as unc-89(sf22) worms (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology. In PK2 KtoA mutants, mitochondrial fragmentation results from greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria In C. elegans, mitochondrial fusion and fission are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44 (Fig. 5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); fission is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited to mitochondria where it forms a large spiral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously47(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. Fig. 5. drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). Open in a new tab a Mitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion and fission, through the actions of several conserved GTPases of the dynamin family. The names of the nematode proteins are indicated with their mammalian orthologs shown in parentheses. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria stained with anti-ATP5A. The drp-1 null mutant shows abnormally clumped mitochondria, whereas unc-89(sf22) shows fragmented (smaller) mitochondria. The double mutant, unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) shows the Drp-1 single mutant phenotype. Scale bar, 5 μm.In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, fission is promoted48. We tested the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which unc-89 KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmentation is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c). Therefore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at least partially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are more fragmented. Fig. 6. More DRP-1 is associated with UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutant mitochondria as compared to wild-type mitochondria.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Because mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased respiration and ATP production49,50, we compared levels of ATP in wild type vs. each of the 4 PK2 KtoA mutant alleles. Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to find that each mutant shows at least a 40% increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status51. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells52,53. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm)54. The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels55. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions. Fig. 7. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated ATP levels.

Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled in unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondrial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type in C. elegans56 to isolate mitochondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from the myo-3 promoter, total mitochondria were purified, and then mostly muscle-specific mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in muscle mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-based respiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex I induced respiration (addition of substrates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria from unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) showed significantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupled by adding FCCP (Fig. 8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respiration (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncoupled (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8. PK2 KtoA mutants display altered mitochondrial respiration and altered levels of some electron transport chain complexes. Open in a new tab a, b Muscle mitochondria from PK2 KtoA mutants have increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration and each cannot be uncoupled. a Complex I (glutamate and malate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 3–8 per strain). b Complex II (succinate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 4–5 per strain). Means and standard errors of the mean are represented. Significance was tested by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.005, ***p ≤ 0.0005, ****p ≤ 0.00005. c, d PK2 KtoA mutants have altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. c Representative western blots reacted against antibodies to the indicated components of complexes I, II, IV, V, and cytochrome C. d Quantitation of these results with n = 3. au: arbitrary units. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Note that as compared to wild type, complexes I and V are normal, but complexes II and IV are reduced, and cytochrome C is elevated in the PK2 KtoA mutants.To gain insight into why complex I respiration is increased and complex II respiration is decreased, we assessed the protein levels of one component of each electron chain complex by western blots. Unfortunately, we could not identify a commercially available antibody that reacted against a complex III component, so complex III was not assessed. As shown in Fig. 8c, d, the levels of complexes I and V are normal, complexes II and IV are decreased, and cytochrome C (which shunts electrons from III to IV) is increased. These results only partially explain why complex II-based respiration is decreased. Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partially explain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we explored the additional possibility that glycolysis was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycolysis when mitochondria do not perform well57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is significantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig. 9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Fig. 9. PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. Open in a new tab Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig. 8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs)58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles59. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig. 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study. Fig. 10. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated levels of UCP-4 protein but not mRNA. Open in a new tab a Representative western blot reacted with anti-HA to detect UCP-4-HA.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria Since the presumed inactivation of PK2 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation we wondered what would happen if the activity of PK2 was increased. We tested this by overexpressing a portion of UNC-89 containing wild-type PK2. We reported that a segment consisting of the C-terminal third of the interkinase region followed by Ig53, Fn2, and PK2 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-Pk2), when transgenically expressed from a heat shock promoter localizes to the M-line, the normal location of UNC-8946. This strain and wild type, as day 1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30° for 2 h, and then immunostained using anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, although mitochondria from the wild type showed the expected linear/tubular organization, mitochondria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clumping. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1, but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are fragmented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission60. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it48. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity. That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into the mitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins, C. elegans expresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoA mutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2 KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2. Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria61. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the first to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al.63 demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function49,64. However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission65. Feng et al.66 reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle67. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.",

Copyright notice ID: 11487192 PMID: 39420071 Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Subject terms: Cytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria UNC-89, a giant protein localized to muscle sarcomeres, contains 2 protein kinase domains, one of which, PK2 is a canonical kinase. A missense mutation expected to inactivate PK2 results in worms with an unexpected phenotype suggesting signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria.Introduction Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9. unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11 (WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genome contains a single unc-89 gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26. Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability of C. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication.Results Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected to result in instability A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST confirmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinases). The DMT class takes its name from their representative Death-associated-protein kinases (DAPKs), Myosin light-chain-kinases (MLCKs), and Triple functional domain protein-related kinases (TRIO) and contains, in addition, various muscle kinases including human titin kinase, nematode twitchin kinase (TwcK) and mammalian obscurin and SPEG kinases32. The BLAST search revealed that PK2 shares the highest sequence identity levels with DAPKs, TwcK, and MLCK (Supplementary Fig. 1). DAPK, TwcK, and MLCK kinases are proven to be catalytically active and their phosphotransfer has been characterized33–35. Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Specifically, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involved in ATP-binding, an AAK motif in β-strand β3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms a salt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committed state of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residue chelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartate and a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordination), both in the catalytic loop motif36,37. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK1138, TP53RK39, and mouse obscurin PK228 contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively. Fig. 1.

Bottom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs. unc-89(sf22). The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are ~800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspecific reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies46.During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC-89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness36. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement31,32. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable, we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldX v441. This yielded a calculated comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, of −0.15 kcal/mol and indicated that no significant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. To summarize, UNC-89-PK2 is modeled by Alphafold in a catalytically-primed conformational state compatible with kinase activity, the active site comprises the essential functional groups necessary for phosphor-transfer and the introduced mutation is not expected to cause structural instability. Taken together, bioinformatics analysis indicates that UNC-89-PK2 is a canonical, active kinase and that the observed nematode phenotype in this work results from hindered phosphor-transfer by PK2 resulting from the inactivating KtoA mutation.Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move faster than wild-type nematodes We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm (Fig. 1d), unc-89(sf22), in which PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-target mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody10. Surprisingly, unlike all other unc-89 mutants, unc-89(sf22) worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostaining using antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for the base of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, and F-actin for I-bands (Fig. 2a–c). Detection and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, the normal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major loss of the mutant UNC-89 protein. To examine the myofilament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As shown in Fig. 2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres in unc-89(sf22) and in unc-89(syb1360), a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin filaments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Fig. 2. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure.

Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells (23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myofilament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick filaments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin filaments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs).

Bottom row displays the enlargement of one portion of the image above it. Yellow arrows, M-lines; yellow arrowheads, dense bodies, green arrows, SR. There is no discernible difference between the wild type and the two mutants in terms of numbers and organization of thick and thin filaments, M-lines, dense bodies, and SR. Scale bars, 0.5 μm.Because deficiency of mouse obscurin23 and worm UNC-8924 result in disorganized SR, we examined SR organization using the marker UNC-68 (Ryanodine receptor). However, HA-tagged UNC-68 endogenously expressed from a CRISPR/Cas9 strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a), or myc-tagged UNC-68 overexpressed from a transgene (Supplementary Fig. 4b) show normal localization in unc-89(sf22). Obscurin is also required for normal microtubule organization42. However, we found no difference in microtubule organization comparing wild type vs. unc-89(sf22), using a transgenic line expressing TBA-1 (α-tubulin) tagged with HA (Supplementary Fig. 5). unc-89 is also expressed in the single sarcomere muscle cells of the pharynx. UNC-89 is normally localized to the middle of the A-bands of pharyngeal sarcomeres8,10. All previously characterized unc-89 mutants, except for unc-89(tm752), have abnormally organized filaments as observed by polarized light or immunostaining6,9,11, with characteristic arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, both unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) display normal pharyngeal muscle as assessed by staining with anti-UNC-89 and the pharyngeal muscle-specific MHC C. Nearly all previously characterized unc-89 mutants have reduced whole animal locomotion and generate reduced maximal force9, most likely because sarcomere disorganization results in reduced muscle activity. The one known exception is unc-89(ad539), but this mutant only affects the organization of the pharyngeal muscle. Two independently derived UNC-89 KtoA mutants, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360), crawl faster than wild-type worms on an agar surface (Fig. 3a), and generate the same amount of maximal force43 as wild type (Fig. 3b).

This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others44. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105)45 have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms8,11(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig2624,46, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig3946, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria. Fig. 4. Body wall muscle cells of UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Open in a new tab a Confocal images of body wall muscle stained with antibodies to ATP5A to reveal the morphology of mitochondria. Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as “tubular”. In contrast, unc-89(sf22) which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, and unc-89(tm752) which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear as dots or can be described as fragmented. By comparison, unc-89(e1460) which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, and unc-89(su75) which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear more tubular or more like wild type. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicated strains. Note the presence of linear or tubular mitochondria in wild type and unc-89(e1460) and fragmented mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752). c, d Three additional independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutants (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) show fragmented mitochondria. Scale bars, 10 μm in (a and c); 5 μm in (b and d).Because CRISPR/Cas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change. sf22 and sf24 are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, and syb1195 and syb1360 are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type. The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation as unc-89(sf22) worms (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology.In PK2 KtoA mutants, mitochondrial fragmentation results from greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria In C. elegans, mitochondrial fusion and fission are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44 (Fig. 5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); fission is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited to mitochondria where it forms a large spiral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously47(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. Fig. 5. drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). Open in a new tab a Mitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion and fission, through the actions of several conserved GTPases of the dynamin family. The names of the nematode proteins are indicated with their mammalian orthologs shown in parentheses. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria stained with anti-ATP5A. The drp-1 null mutant shows abnormally clumped mitochondria, whereas unc-89(sf22) shows fragmented (smaller) mitochondria. The double mutant, unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) shows the Drp-1 single mutant phenotype. Scale bar, 5 μm.In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, fission is promoted48. We tested the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which unc-89 KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmentation is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c). Therefore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at least partially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are more fragmented. Fig. 6. More DRP-1 is associated with UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutant mitochondria as compared to wild-type mitochondria.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Because mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased respiration and ATP production49,50, we compared levels of ATP in wild type vs. each of the 4 PK2 KtoA mutant alleles. Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to find that each mutant shows at least a 40% increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status51. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells52,53. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm)54. The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels55. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions. Fig. 7. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated ATP levels.

For each strain, n = 3, and *: p < 0.05 by Dunnett’s test.Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled in unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondrial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type in C. elegans56 to isolate mitochondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from the myo-3 promoter, total mitochondria were purified, and then mostly muscle-specific mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in muscle mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-based respiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex I induced respiration (addition of substrates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria from unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) showed significantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupled by adding FCCP (Fig. 8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respiration (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncoupled (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8. PK2 KtoA mutants display altered mitochondrial respiration and altered levels of some electron transport chain complexes. Open in a new tab a, b Muscle mitochondria from PK2 KtoA mutants have increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration and each cannot be uncoupled. a Complex I (glutamate and malate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 3–8 per strain). b Complex II (succinate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 4–5 per strain). Means and standard errors of the mean are represented. Significance was tested by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.005, ***p ≤ 0.0005, ****p ≤ 0.00005. c, d PK2 KtoA mutants have altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. c Representative western blots reacted against antibodies to the indicated components of complexes I, II, IV, V, and cytochrome C. d Quantitation of these results with n = 3. au: arbitrary units. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Note that as compared to wild type, complexes I and V are normal, but complexes II and IV are reduced, and cytochrome C is elevated in the PK2 KtoA mutants.To gain insight into why complex I respiration is increased and complex II respiration is decreased, we assessed the protein levels of one component of each electron chain complex by western blots. Unfortunately, we could not identify a commercially available antibody that reacted against a complex III component, so complex III was not assessed. As shown in Fig. 8c, d, the levels of complexes I and V are normal, complexes II and IV are decreased, and cytochrome C (which shunts electrons from III to IV) is increased. These results only partially explain why complex II-based respiration is decreased.Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partially explain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we explored the additional possibility that glycolysis was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycolysis when mitochondria do not perform well57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is significantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig. 9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Fig. 9. PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. Open in a new tab Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig. 8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs)58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles59. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig. 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study. Fig. 10. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated levels of UCP-4 protein but not mRNA. Open in a new tab a Representative western blot reacted with anti-HA to detect UCP-4-HA.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria Since the presumed inactivation of PK2 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation we wondered what would happen if the activity of PK2 was increased. We tested this by overexpressing a portion of UNC-89 containing wild-type PK2. We reported that a segment consisting of the C-terminal third of the interkinase region followed by Ig53, Fn2, and PK2 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-Pk2), when transgenically expressed from a heat shock promoter localizes to the M-line, the normal location of UNC-8946. This strain and wild type, as day 1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30° for 2 h, and then immunostained using anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, although mitochondria from the wild type showed the expected linear/tubular organization, mitochondria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clumping. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1, but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria.Discussion We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are fragmented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission60. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it48. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity. That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into the mitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins, C. elegans expresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoA mutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2 KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2. Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria61. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the first to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al.63 demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function49,64. However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission65. Feng et al.66 reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle67. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.Materials and methods Bioinformatics analysis of PK2 Three-dimensional structural models of UNC-89-PK2 (UniProtKB O01761) were calculated using AlphaFold v2.3.168 as implemented in the ColabFold 1.5.5 server (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). In order to estimate the effect of the KtoA mutation (K7816A in UniProtKB O01761) on kinase stability, we calculated a comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, between wild type and in silico mutated PK2 models, where ΔΔG = ΔGKtoA – ΔGwt. To calculate the ΔΔG value, the best-ranking AlphaFold model was used as template in FoldX v441, applying the RepairPDB function for gentle model equilibration, followed by the introduction of the KtoA mutation using the PositionScan function, as described in ref. 69.

Details about the sgRNAs and repair templates used are given in Supplementary Fig. 11.Western blots The method of Hannak et al.70 was used to prepare total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22), unc-89(syb1360), drp-1(tm1108), PHX6586 ucp-4(syb6586), GB367 unc-89(sf22); ucp-4(syb6586), GB368 unc-89(syb1360); ucp-4(syb6586), and GB267 sfIs13[hsp::HA::UNC-89 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-PK2; sur-5::GFP)] worms. To detect UNC-89 proteins, we separated the protein lysate on a 3% stacking and 5% separating Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h, and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:400 dilution10, followed by reaction with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. Western blots to detect DRP-1 were used in three types of experiments. First, to check the specificity of anti-DRP-1 antibodies, equal quantities of total protein lysates from wild type and drp-1(tm1108) were separated on a 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted against affinity-purified anti-DRP-1 at 1:200 dilution which had been pre-absorbed against an acetone powder of E. coli OP50 to reduce or eliminate reaction to bacterial proteins. Second, we used a similar approach to compare the levels of DRP-1 in total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Third, we compared the level of DRP-1 from total worm mitochondria from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Preparation of total worm mitochondria by differential centrifugation was conducted as described below in the section on purifying muscle mitochondria. We also performed western blots to compare the levels of representative components of electron chain complexes from total protein lysates. Antibodies and concentrations were: complex I, mouse monoclonal to NDUFS3 (Abcam cat. no. ab14711) at 1:2,500 dilution; complex II, rabbit anti-SDHA (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 11998 P) at 1:500 dilution; complex IV, mouse monoclonal to MTCO1 (Abcam cat. no. ab14705) at 1:2000 dilution; complex V, mouse monoclonal to ATP5A (Abcam cat. no. ab147481) at 1:5000 dilution; and mouse monoclonal to cytochrome C (Abcam cat. no. ab110325) at 1:1000 dilution. Finally, we performed western blots to measure the level of UCP-4-HA in wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) backgrounds using anti-HA (rabbit monoclonal cat. no. C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000 dilution. Before use, the optimal dilutions of each antibody were determined to yield linear detection of the proteins. Protein bands were quantitated by comparing to scans of Ponceau S staining of a gel lane on the blot. The uncropped and unedited blot images used to prepare Figs. 1d, 6a–c, 8c, 10a, and Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, are shown respectively in Supplementary Figs. 12–16.Immunostaining and confocal microscopy of body wall muscle myofilament lattice and mitochondria, and pharyngeal myofilament lattice Day 0 or day 1 adult worms were fixed and immunostained using the method described by Nonet et al.71. The following antibodies were used to stain parts of the myofilament lattice, all at 1:200 dilution: anti-UNC-95 (rabbit polyclonal Benian-13)72, anti-MHC A (mouse monoclonal 5–6)73, and anti-UNC-89(rabbit polyclonal EU30)10. Fixation and phalloidin-rhodamine staining were conducted as described in ref. 74. To visualize mitochondria, we used mouse monoclonal antibody (15H4C4) also at 1:200 dilution (Abcam cat. no. ab14748). For pharyngeal muscle imaging, the fixed adult day 1 worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (EU30) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.175) at 1:100. Secondary antibodies, used at 1:200 dilution, included anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and anti-mouse Alexa 594, all purchased from Invitrogen. Confocal images were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100 M microscope and an Apochromat x63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, in 1× and 2.5× zoom mode. For the confocal images, the color balances were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Super-resolution microscopy was performed using a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 561-nm solid-state laser, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). Super-resolution images were reconstructed using the N-SIM module in NIS-Elements software. The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series every 0.2 μm was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell. This Z stack was then reconstructed into a 3D image using software on the N-SIM microscope. The reconstructed 3D z-stacks were analyzed using Imaris 8.6 (Bitplane), to visualize the mitochondria. Measurement of mitochondrial length in μm from the 3D reconstructions of SIM images was performed using Imaris software on a combination of 2 images from each wild type and mutant strain. The longest axis of each anti-ATP5A-staining object (mitochondrion) was determined using the Imaris parameter called “BoundingBoxOOLength”. After eliminating objects <1 μm, the number of objects was placed and counted in 3 bins: 1 ≤ × < 5 μm, 5 ≤ × < 10 μm, and x ≥ 10 μm. The Y axis of the graph in Supplementary Fig. 8 represents the number of objects in each bin divided by the total number objects.Electron microscopy Electron microscopy of body wall muscle was performed as described in Matsunaga et al.45. From each strain, approximately 200 days 2 adults were fixed and processed, and approximately 10 randomly selected ultrathin sections were examined. Approximately 30 low-powered images were captured that revealed all of the sarcomeres of single body wall muscle cells, and from these 10–20 images at higher magnification were captured that revealed 1–2 sarcomeres each. All these images were examined by two individuals both on a computer screen and by printouts, looking for any differences between the wild type and the two mutant alleles, sf22 and syb1360. Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d.Crawling assays and NemaFlex force measurement For crawling assays, day two adults were harvested from one 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plate with M9 buffer, and a final wash in M9 containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. Five microliters of worm suspension were added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate and then the excess liquid was removed using a twisted KimWipe. After a five-minute adaptation time, worm crawling movement was recorded using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope fitted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). For all strains a total of fifteen, 10-s. videos were recorded from various sections of the plate with each video tracking an average of 8 individual animals. Video data was analyzed by Image J WrmTracker software plug-in to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) for individual animals. Worms that moved out of frame and outliers were removed during data analysis and an average of 20 animals were analyzed for each strain. The resulting BBPS values for each mutant strain were compared to the wild type and further tested for statistically significant differences using Welch’s T-test. The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was measured using the NemaFlex method43. The technique is based on the deflection of soft micropillars as the animals crawl through an array of micropillars. The pillars are arranged in a square lattice with a pillar diameter of 44 μm and height of 87 μm. The gap between the pillars is 71 μm. Day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber76, and a 1-min video was captured for each animal in a food-free environment at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C. Imaging was performed in brightfield using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and an Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Images were acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4× objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 μm per pixel. Movies were processed and analyzed for force values using in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Animal muscle strength measurements were calculated by identifying the maximal force exerted in each frame for an individual animal. We define the maximum exertable force f95 corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Generation of antibodies to DRP-1 Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to the C-terminal 143 residues of DRP-1b, amino acids 570-712. The coding sequence of this segment was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool (RB2 library) and cloned into vectors pGEX-KK1 and pMAL-KK, to express glutathione S-transferase (GST) and MBP fusion proteins in E. coli77. In brief, to express each fusion protein, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Millipore Corporation, cat. no. 71397-4), and grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 10 µg/ml ampicillin at 37° to OD600 = 0.6–0.8, followed by induction of expression with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20° for 5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Inc., cat. no. 11836170001), and broken in a French pressure cell at 1000 pounds inch−2, the addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, followed by spinning out debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The lysates were added to either a slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, cat. no. G-4510) or amylose resin (New England BioLabs, cat. no. E8021L) and incubated with mixing for 30 min at 4°. The beads were washed 5X with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 100 mM PMSF, and then 4× with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM PMSF. The beads were placed into minicolumns and eluted with either 10 mM free glutathione or 10 mM maltose in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The GST fusions were shipped to Noble Life Sciences (Sykesville, Maryland) for the production of rabbit antibodies. Antibodies were affinity-purified using Affi-gel (Bio-Rad)-conjugated MBP fusions, as described78. Briefly, the MBP fusion proteins were dialyzed against 100 mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.0, and then 3–10 mg were covalently coupled to 1 ml of a 50:50 mixture of Affi-Gel 10 and Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, cat. nos. 1536099 and 153-6051). These columns were then used to affinity purify ~2 ml of antiserum and the antibodies eluted with low and high pH and concentrated with a centrifugal filter (Centriprep 10, Millipore, cat. no. 4304).Measurement of ATP levels in whole worms 100 day 1 adults were collected and washed free from bacteria, pelleted in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After placing on ice for 5 min and vortexing for 5 s, debris was pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microfuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and diluted 5–10 fold with deionized water and kept on ice. Using this material, the total protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, cat. no. 23225), and the total ATP determined using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit from Promega Corporation. Results were expressed as nmoles of ATP per milligram of protein.Use of PercevalHR to measure ATP/ADP ratio The plasmid pRsetB-PercevalHR was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA), and The XbaI/XhoI fragment of pRsetB-PercevalHR was inserted into the vector pPD95.86 via its XbaI/SalI sites to allow expression of PercevalHR from the muscle-specific promoter for the myo-3 gene. The resulting plasmid, myo-3p::PercevalHR at 10 ng/ml, was co-injected into worms together with the transformation marker plasmid lin-44p::GFP at 90 ng/ml, into wild-type worms, and transgenic animals were selected on the basis of GFP expression in the worm tail. The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation79 with modifications (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296, sfIs21[myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP]. sfIs21 was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and into drp-1(tm1108), to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a major conformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound. Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a fluorescent read-out of this conformation. An ATP to ADP ratio is proportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults were immobilized for imaging without drugs using a combination of a PDMS microfluidic device with channels just large enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F12780. The microfluidic devices were kindly manufactured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Aqueous solutions of Pluronic F127 are fluid at 4°, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created by dividing the emissions, Em 488/Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images, the total number of pixels with intensity greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations were calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain.Purification of muscle mitochondria and respirometry Body wall muscle-specific mitochondria were purified from strains expressing tomm20-mKate2-HA from the promoter of the muscle-specific gene myo-3, using a modified version of the procedure developed by Ahier et al.56. Briefly, for each strain, we harvested a mixed-stage population of nematodes from 2, 15 cm, high peptone plates seeded with E. coli strain NA22. Worms were washed free from bacteria by at least 3 washes of M9 buffer, followed by 2 washes with deionized water. The worm pellets were resuspended in 3.5 mls of ice-cold Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer (MIB; 50 mM KCl, 110 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris pH 7.4 without protease inhibitors) and transferred to a 7 ml Dounce homogenizer. While on ice, we brought the pestle up and down 25 times. The homogenate was transferred to 3, 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun in a microfuge at 4° for 5 min at 200 × g. The resulting supernatant was transferred to 3 fresh tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. This supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The pellets from all 3 Eppendorf tubes were resuspended in a final volume of 600 μl of ice-cold PEB (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, without protease inhibitors). To this suspension was added 30 μl of a suspension of anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, cat. no. 88836), and the tube placed on a rotating wheel at 4° for one hour. The beads were then pulled out of the solution using a tube stand containing neodymium magnets (Millipore Corporation), and then the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PEB, and then resuspended in 50–100 μl of MIB and kept on ice. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using a Clark electrode (Oxytherm System, Hansatech) as described81. Briefly, isolated muscle mitochondria were suspended in respiration buffer containing 120 mM KCl, 3 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM KH2PO4, and 0.3% (w/v) fat-free BSA. Complex I substrates (10 mM glutamate, and 2 mM malate) or complex II substrates (7 mM succinate) were added in addition to 1.2 mM ADP to stimulate basal respiration. Uncoupled respiration was measured with the addition of 80 nM FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was assessed with the addition of potassium cyanide (500 μM). To assess mitochondrial respiration, the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was subtracted from the total oxygen consumption rate.Glycolysis assay We used Abcam’s “6-Phosphofructokinase Activity Assay Kit (colorimetric)” (ab155898) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 50 milligrams of packed worms were homogenized in 200 μl of PFK Assay Buffer, using a Pellet Pestle Motor (DWK Life Sciences Kimble Kontes). After determining the protein concentrations using a Bradford assay, approximately 1 μg of total protein extract was used per assay. PFK activity was recorded as mU/mg protein.Statistics and reproducibility GraphPad Prism9 was used to plot and analyze numerical data. Figure legends explain the n values, whether standard deviations or standard errors of the mean were plotted, which statistical tests were used, and the definition of * values. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction unless otherwise specified. Each experiment was conducted several times independently and only if the same results or tendencies were obtained, were figures and conclusions made. Many experiments involved imaging and evaluation of the images was conducted by at least two individuals but in most cases, no quantitation was involved, so statistical analysis was not used.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Peer Review File (3.5MB, pdf) Supplementary Information (32.9MB, pdf) 42003_2024_7042_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (87.3KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary File Supplementary Data (67.3KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements These studies were primarily supported by grant no. 2050009 from the National Science Foundation to G.M.B and J.Q.K.

    "abstract": "Abstract The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation. Keywords: viability, microarray, 454 pyrosequencing, PMA, PhyloChip, 16S rRNA gene",
    "introduction": "Introduction Microbial cells are traditionally classified as either viable (maintaining active metabolism and membrane integrity), viable but dormant (because of external pressures) or non-viable (dead) (Kaprelyants et al., 1993; Keer and Birch, 2003). The vast majority of microorganisms cannot be cultivated and many that can require long cultivation times (Amann et al., 1995). To minimize the time spent in determining viability and bias associated with such analyses, advanced molecular approaches for assessing cellular viability have been recently developed, including live–dead staining (Boulos et al., 1999) and flow cytometry-based techniques (Ben-Amor et al., 2005). In such cases, however, there is inherent risk of overestimating the total number of viable cells in samples because of variation in binding affinities of the dyes used. Methods probing RNA as an alternative to DNA have also been developed for assessing viability (DeAngelis et al., 2011), but these too come with complications as RNA is difficult to purify, less stable, prone to degradation and often isolated in quantities insufficient for analysis (Hierro et al., 2006; Andorra et al., 2010). The development of high-throughput pyrosequencing and phylogenetic microarray techniques has dramatically increased the resolution and detectable spectrum of diverse microbial lineages from environmental samples (Sogin et al., 2006; La Duc et al., 2009; Mendes et al., 2011). However, DNA-based molecular technologies alone have yet to be validated for assessing the differential viability of cells across varying phylogenetic lineages in a complex microbial assemblage. DNA-derived signals, which originate from both living and dead cell types, often lead to interpretations that overestimate the viable microbial population present (Rogers et al., 2008; Pointing et al., 2009). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based analyses increase the speed, sensitivity and specificity of quantitative microbial detection (Hierro et al., 2006; Yanez et al., 2011). Unfortunately, qPCR techniques alone cannot differentiate live from dead cells, as the latter contribute template DNA to the overall PCR amplification (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008). The persistence of nucleic acids post-cell death renders cogent estimations of live–dead cellular ratios in a given sample practically impossible, as naked DNA will ultimately result in the overestimation of total cells (Nocker et al., 2006). The treatment of microbial cell suspensions with propidium monoazide (PMA), which first intercalates and on photo-activation, covalently binds DNA, before DNA extraction followed by downstream PCR and related molecular analyses has become an increasingly popular technique for the selective detection and enumeration of viable microbes (Hein et al., 2006; Nocker et al., 2006; Wagner et al., 2008; Bae and Wuertz, 2009). The use of PMA for discriminating live from dead cells has been studied across various applications and research testbeds, including food (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008), biosolids (van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2011), infectious enteric viruses in water samples (Parshionikar et al., 2010), fungi (Vesper et al., 2008), bacteriophage T4 (Fittipaldi et al., 2010), infectious parasitic protozoa (Brescia et al., 2009) and wastewater treatment plants (Lin et al., 2011). Recently, PMA treatment has been used in combination with crude microarray analysis for assessing cell viability (Nocker et al., 2009). In addition, pyrosequencing profiles of water samples exposed to high temperature and treated with and without PMA have been comparatively analyzed (Nocker et al., 2010). The development and validation of molecular methods to selectively detect and enumerate the living fraction of the microbial population resident on critical surfaces (for example, hospital operating rooms, pharmaceutical manufacturing and packaging facilities, semiconductor fabrication, and spacecraft assembly cleanrooms) is of immense importance to good manufacturing practices aimed at minimizing contaminant bioburden levels. Reported here for the first time are the results of pioneering efforts coupling PMA-based viability discrimination with innovative PhyloChip DNA microarray and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) methodologies to assess the viable bacterial population present in a typical low-biomass environmental sample.",

    "results": "Results Quantitative PCR Total bacterial burden, as assessed by bacteria-directed qPCR, is given in Table 1. When PMA treatment was omitted before molecular processing, the total bacterial burden (viable+non-viable) of the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples was ∼105 to 106 rRNA gene copies m−2. Samples collected from the inactive Bldg 144 facility floor and GSE yielded 1 to 2-logs higher rRNA gene copy numbers than SAF samples both with and without PMA treatment. Following treatment with PMA, a mere 7% (floors) and 4% (GSE) of the total bacterial population encountered about the mission-critical SAF was determined to be viable. However, the bacterial population present in PMA-treated Bldg 144 samples was 21% (floors) and 7% (GSE) viable. On comparative analysis, Bldg 144 floors housed a 188-fold greater viable bacterial burden than their mission-critical SAF counterparts. Similarly, Bldg 144 GSE samples contained 25-fold more viable bacteria than their SAF GSE equivalents. bTEFAP analysis A breakdown of the number of MOTU observed in the various samples examined over the course of this study is provided in Table 1. Overall, Bldg 144 cleanroom floor samples housed 3.6-fold more bacterial MOTU than the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor, whereas the GSE surfaces from each of these cleanrooms yielded a roughly equivalent number of MOTU. The effect of PMA treatment was significantly higher in both SAF (97% MOTU reduction) and Bldg 144 (75% MOTU reduction) floor samples, which indicated the presence of a large number of dead cells or extraneous DNA on these floors. A similar trend was observed in PMA-treated GSE samples from SAF (reduced from 425 to 17 MOTU) and Bldg 144 (reduced from 571 to 42 MOTU). A breakdown of MOTU, at the level of bacterial phyla or class, observed in the various samples examined is detailed in Table 2. The mission-critical SAF floor retained MOTU affiliated with physiologically recalcitrant bacteria (Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes), whereas the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor harbored predominantly proteobacterial MOTU. It was particularly apparent that a few acidobacterial types (4 MOTU) were present in great abundance (112 sequences) in the SAF floor samples. However, the GSE samples exhibited no such correlation between MOTU numbers and sequence occurrence. A closer examination of the pyrosequence reads resulting from the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples indicated a predominance of members of the genera: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Arsenicicoccus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Kineococcus, Propionibacterium, Nocardioides, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Deinococcus and Staphylococcus. Many of the sequences arising from the physiologically recalcitrant bacteria observed in cleanroom floor samples sans PMA treatment were absent or in very low number in the PMA-treated fractions of the very same sample.

Regardless of sample type, PMA-treated sample fractions consistently yielded considerably fewer pyrosequences than their untreated counterparts. Anywhere from 14 to 2196 high-quality pyrosequences (>250 bp) were obtained from samples that had been pre-treated with PMA, whereas 1783 to 15 914 high-quality pyrosequences were recovered from untreated samples. Even when PMA treatment was omitted, the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (GI-36-4) yielded far fewer pyrosequences (1783 reads) than the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor sample (GI-42-1; 15 914 reads). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the PMA-untreated cleanroom floor samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1a. Approximately 65% of the pyrosequences retrieved from these two distinct facility floor samples were detected in both cleanrooms, although this shared fraction represented only 8% of the total observed MOTU (46 out of 569; Figure 1a). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the untreated SAF samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1b. Between the SAF floor and GSE samples, ∼38% of the total number of detected pyrosequence reads were shared, although this constituted a mere 7.8% of the total MOTU (43 out of 547). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Venn diagram showing the MOTU detected in various samples of the cleanrooms. Comparison (a) between SAF and Bldg 144 cleanroom floor samples and (b) between floor and GSE samples of SAF cleanroom. Parentheses denote total number of pyrosequences generated and the numerals without parentheses are total number of MOTU present in that sample. PhyloChip analysis A drastic decrease in the total number of bacterial genera was observed in all samples on pre-treatment with PMA (Table 1). After having been treated with PMA, the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples exhibited very simple bacterial community structure, housing very few genera (9 and 3, respectively) of Firmicute and Proteobacteria lineage. Without PMA treatment, these very same floor and GSE samples yielded many more genera, which represented a diverse assemblage of taxa (Table 3) dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The Bldg 144 cleanroom floor and GSE samples also presented many more genera without PMA pre-treatment (199 and 236, respectively) than the very same samples having been treated with PMA (106 and 75).

Such analysis clearly illustrates a marked decrease in the hybridization scores of all samples treated with PMA, as compared with the very same samples not treated with PMA. For instance, the SAF GSE sample (GI-36-3) exhibited very high transformed hybridization intensities for detected PTU sans PMA treatment. However, when treated with PMA, this very same sample showed a dramatic reduction in all resulting hybridization intensity scores, which suggested that the majority of the detected 16S rRNA genes arose from deceased members of the community. In order to identify the viable members that exhibited increased hybridization intensities after PMA treatment, ratios of non-PMA-treated and PMA-treated hybridization scores were calculated for each PTU, and are presented as a heatmap (Figure 2). An observed increase in the transformed hybridization intensity of a given PTU following PMA treatment would likely stem from PCR bias in non-PMA-treated samples, where high levels of DNA originating from non-viable cells are co-amplified. This amplification of template DNA arising from non-viable cell types masks the presence of smaller levels of DNA template arising from viable cells. Hence, transformed hybridization intensities are elevated on removing the template DNA arising from non-viable cells from the equation (that is, PMA-treated sample fraction). The SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples gave rise to fewer PTU with higher transformed hybridization ratios. At the same time, PMA-treated Bldg 144 cleanroom samples were richer in PTU having increased transformed hybridization intensity ratios, which was indicative of a relatively greater viable population. These PTU belonged to the Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. A phylogenetic tree of PhyloChip PTU grouped at the family level is provided as Supplementary Figure 2, which shows the presence of the detected families in each sample with and without PMA treatment. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Heatmap of PTU that increased in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated samples compared with non-PMA-treated samples and were called present in the PMA-treated sample. An increase in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated sample is reflected as a positive ratio. In total, 801 PTU were identified that fulfilled this requirement, which were grouped into 70 genera. Displayed are representatives of all genera with the most drastic changes for each sample pair. Numbers in parentheses are the total number of PTU. Statistical analysis of microbial community profiles The various samples examined by bTEFAP analysis consistently showed lower Shannon–Wiener diversity indices when treated with PMA compared with their corresponding non-treated samples (Supplementary Table 1). PCoA was performed to study the environmental clustering and relatedness of community profiles derived from bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses (Figure 3). All of the samples analyzed without PMA treatment clustered together, indicative of their relatively similar community structure, compared with their coinciding PMA-treated sample fractions. The clustering observed in the PCoA plot was congruent with the dendogram clustering presented in Supplementary Figure 1, which implied a close association among all non-PMA samples. Multi-response permutation procedure analysis was performed to assess the difference in community structure between PMA-treated sample fractions and non-PMA-treated sample fractions, derived by both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analysis. The null hypothesis (no difference in PMA-treated and non-PMA-treated samples) was rejected based on the significance of the delta for both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses (0.028 and 0.037, respectively). The chance-corrected within-group agreements were fairly low for bTEFAP sequence data (A=0.0411) but high (A=0.2605) for PhyloChip data, which reflect the observed grouping in PCoA. In addition, Adonis testing clearly showed a significant change in the detected community profiles after PMA treatment (P-value bTEFAP: 0.04, P-value PhyloChip: 0.02). Based on the multiple statistical approaches used, such as Adonis, multi-response permutation procedure, a Euclidean distance-based dendogram (Supplementary Figure 1), and ordination (PCoA) analyses (Figure 3), it was clear that PMA-treated samples and non-PMA samples were significantly dissimilar with respect to diversity in bacterial community profiles.

    "discussion": "Discussion Over the past 25 years, sequence analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes has become the ‘gold standard' for assessing species richness in mixed microbial communities, and as a result, total resolvable microbial diversity is now estimated to be threefold greater than that based solely on cultivation (Pace, 1997). As sequences from organisms in greatest abundance are far more likely to be represented in clone libraries than those from singleton and low-abundance taxa, it is advantageous to use high-throughput technologies, such as bTEFAP and PhyloChip, which have been shown to render a far superior representation of community structure (Brodie et al., 2006; Sogin et al., 2006; DeSantis et al., 2007; La Duc et al., 2009). The application of PMA to assess the differential viability of microbial cells is increasing in popularity within the scientific community (Nocker et al., 2009; van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2011). When used to pre-treat samples, the PMA concentration applied in this study effectively precluded ∼90% of the total DNA template molecules from downstream manipulation, resulting in the generation of only 2827 pyrosequences, whereas 27 449 pyrosequences were obtained from the very same samples without PMA pre-treatment. With respect to diversity, all of the pyrosequences generated after PMA treatment represented a mere 171 MOTU, which corresponded to ∼12% of the total number of MOTU resulting from the very same samples without PMA treatment (Table 2). Furthermore, 2- to 3-logs fewer pyrosequences arose from PMA-treated than untreated mission-critical cleanroom samples (0.8% for floor; 2.1% for GSE). The total number of MOTU observed in the operational mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (122 MOTU) was considerably less than that associated with the quiescent Bldg 144 cleanroom floor (447 MOTU). Bioinformatic analyses of pyrosequence data demonstrated that both of these contaminant microbial populations comprised only Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The vast majority of these bacteria, if not all, were present in the SAF mission-critical cleanroom floor samples in a non-viable state. However, about 25% of the detected MOTU (108 out of 447) were observed to be viable in the Bldg 144 facility, suggesting that certain taxa are able to withstand the desiccated and nutrient-deprived conditions of these cleanroom floors (sample #GI-42-1). Actinobacterial genera such as Kineococcus, Kocuria, Modestobacter and Propionibacterium were present in high abundance in the JPL-SAF floor samples. In contrast, the floors of the Bldg 144 facility housed predominantly Proteobacterial genera, as Brevendimonas and Acinetobacter pyrosequences were generated in great numbers. Previously, members of these and other closely related genera have been isolated from spacecraft assembly environments (Osman et al., 2008; La Duc et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2010; Vaishampayan et al., 2012). The molecular biological detection and isolation of these robust microbial lineages from spacecraft-associated environments is of particular consequence to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) planetary protection practices, not to mention routine validation of these cleanroom facilities. Unlike cleanroom floors, which were treated with Kleenol 30 detergent, the GSE materials housed in either cleanroom were subjected only to alcohol wiping, and yet gave rise to similar MOTU and pyrosequence occurrence, with GSE materials kept at the Bldg 144 facility marginally enriched (∼1.3-fold increase in pyrosequences and MOTU). From these results, it is apparent that GSE need to be subjected to more rigorous cleaning regimens, as GSE-associated richness was two to four times greater than that of the floor surfaces. The most frequently encountered bacterial MOTU from the stringently maintained and frequently cleaned floors of the SAF cleanroom were members of the genera: Bacillus, Clostridium and Nocardia. These bacteria are known to survive oligotrophic conditions for extended periods of time, tolerate alkaline and oxidative stress, and avoid death by ultraviolet radiation by morphing into highly resilient, dormant endospores (La Duc et al., 2007; Ghosh et al., 2010; Probst et al., 2010). Although routine cleaning and maintenance regimens limit the number of bacterial taxa capable of persisting in cleanrooms, hardy spore-forming microorganisms like Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp. and Nocardia spp. capitalize on their selective advantage and superior fitness and survive—much to the chagrin of those challenged with bioreduction and sterilization of these environments. The presence of these organisms is detected as a result of their (a) viability, or (b) inability to be penetrated by PMA molecules while in a non-viable state. Owing to subtle nuances inherent in the PMA-chemistry-coupled techniques described herein, endospores and non-viable cells having intact cell walls and/or outer membranes will escape PMA treatment (Nocker et al., 2009; Rawsthorne et al., 2009; Probst et al., 2012), and thus be observed as false-positive viable entities. Similarly, sampling and sample processing steps (for example, the composition of the solution to collect and store microorganisms, method for cell concentration and PMA treatment) might affect the viability of the cells but in a recent study such adverse effect of sample handling procedures was not noticed for sea and canal water samples (Kort et al., 2010; Nocker et al., 2010). As was observed via bTEFAP procedures, PhyloChip-based analyses discerned noticeable differences in the bacterial diversity profiles resulting from PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples. One such observation was the reduction in diversity of proteobacteria detected in PMA-treated samples and prevalence of proteobacteria in samples not treated with PMA. Another consistent result was the observed prevalence of Firmicutes in the PMA-treated samples. This suggests that Gram-positive bacteria are more tolerable of the inhospitable conditions of the cleanroom environment that their Gram-negative kin. Numerous studies have reported varying accounts of the microbial diversity typical of spacecraft-associated cleanrooms, and what the presence of such communities might portend for life detection endeavors in extraterrestrial settings (Venkateswaran et al., 2001; La Duc et al., 2004, 2007; Moissl et al., 2007; Probst et al., 2010; Vaishampayan et al., 2010). Indeed, the introduction of contaminant microbes to extraterrestrial environments could have profound repercussions on (a) the scientific integrity of in situ and sample-return based life detection experiments, and (b) the uncompromised nature of such settings. The worst-case scenario for life-detection experimentation would be the inadvertent transfer of viable contaminant microbiota to an otherwise pristine location of interest. The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest that hitherto, the breadth of diversity enveloped within the viable fraction(s) of typical spacecraft-associated microbial communities have been overestimated. At the same time, these findings enabled the first ever statistically significant differentiation between the total and viable-only portion of microbial communities in cleanroom environments. Significant differences were shown between these two populations using two independent profiling methods, namely bTEFAP and PhyloChip G3. Consequently, these methodologies are an attractive means of discerning viable phylotypes in low-biomass environments. Such a capability is of crucial importance and benefit to numerous industries (for example, healthcare, pharma, semiconductor fabrication), not least of all the NASA, whose planetary protection program is tasked with ensuring spacecraft-borne microorganisms do not result in harmful contamination of extraterrestrial environments.",

Copyright © 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology  Copyright notice ID: 3554398 PMID: 23051695 Abstract The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation. Keywords: viability, microarray, 454 pyrosequencing, PMA, PhyloChip, 16S rRNA geneIntroduction Microbial cells are traditionally classified as either viable (maintaining active metabolism and membrane integrity), viable but dormant (because of external pressures) or non-viable (dead) (Kaprelyants et al., 1993; Keer and Birch, 2003). The vast majority of microorganisms cannot be cultivated and many that can require long cultivation times (Amann et al., 1995). To minimize the time spent in determining viability and bias associated with such analyses, advanced molecular approaches for assessing cellular viability have been recently developed, including live–dead staining (Boulos et al., 1999) and flow cytometry-based techniques (Ben-Amor et al., 2005). In such cases, however, there is inherent risk of overestimating the total number of viable cells in samples because of variation in binding affinities of the dyes used. Methods probing RNA as an alternative to DNA have also been developed for assessing viability (DeAngelis et al., 2011), but these too come with complications as RNA is difficult to purify, less stable, prone to degradation and often isolated in quantities insufficient for analysis (Hierro et al., 2006; Andorra et al., 2010). The development of high-throughput pyrosequencing and phylogenetic microarray techniques has dramatically increased the resolution and detectable spectrum of diverse microbial lineages from environmental samples (Sogin et al., 2006; La Duc et al., 2009; Mendes et al., 2011). However, DNA-based molecular technologies alone have yet to be validated for assessing the differential viability of cells across varying phylogenetic lineages in a complex microbial assemblage. DNA-derived signals, which originate from both living and dead cell types, often lead to interpretations that overestimate the viable microbial population present (Rogers et al., 2008; Pointing et al., 2009). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based analyses increase the speed, sensitivity and specificity of quantitative microbial detection (Hierro et al., 2006; Yanez et al., 2011). Unfortunately, qPCR techniques alone cannot differentiate live from dead cells, as the latter contribute template DNA to the overall PCR amplification (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008). The persistence of nucleic acids post-cell death renders cogent estimations of live–dead cellular ratios in a given sample practically impossible, as naked DNA will ultimately result in the overestimation of total cells (Nocker et al., 2006). The treatment of microbial cell suspensions with propidium monoazide (PMA), which first intercalates and on photo-activation, covalently binds DNA, before DNA extraction followed by downstream PCR and related molecular analyses has become an increasingly popular technique for the selective detection and enumeration of viable microbes (Hein et al., 2006; Nocker et al., 2006; Wagner et al., 2008; Bae and Wuertz, 2009). The use of PMA for discriminating live from dead cells has been studied across various applications and research testbeds, including food (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008), biosolids (van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2011), infectious enteric viruses in water samples (Parshionikar et al., 2010), fungi (Vesper et al., 2008), bacteriophage T4 (Fittipaldi et al., 2010), infectious parasitic protozoa (Brescia et al., 2009) and wastewater treatment plants (Lin et al., 2011). Recently, PMA treatment has been used in combination with crude microarray analysis for assessing cell viability (Nocker et al., 2009). In addition, pyrosequencing profiles of water samples exposed to high temperature and treated with and without PMA have been comparatively analyzed (Nocker et al., 2010). The development and validation of molecular methods to selectively detect and enumerate the living fraction of the microbial population resident on critical surfaces (for example, hospital operating rooms, pharmaceutical manufacturing and packaging facilities, semiconductor fabrication, and spacecraft assembly cleanrooms) is of immense importance to good manufacturing practices aimed at minimizing contaminant bioburden levels. Reported here for the first time are the results of pioneering efforts coupling PMA-based viability discrimination with innovative PhyloChip DNA microarray and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) methodologies to assess the viable bacterial population present in a typical low-biomass environmental sample.Materials and methods Sampling location The two cleanroom facilities examined in this study were both certified as ISO 8. Spacecraft hardware and componentry was housed and assembled in the first cleanroom site, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) (sample #GI-36; Table 1), whereas the second cleanroom site, JPL cleanroom Building (Bldg)144 (sample #GI-42; Table 1), did not house spacecraft hardware at the time of sample collection. Both of these cleanroom facilities operated at a positive pressure, with temperatures in the range of 20±4 °C, and relative humidity ranging from 30% to 50%. Ground support equipment (GSE) consisted of all non-flight hardware items used during spacecraft hardware receipt, assembly, integration, test, storage, shipment and pre-launch activities. All GSE materials used inside the cleanrooms were inspected for compliance to visible cleanliness. Table 1. Physical, chemical and bacterial characteristics of samples collected during this study.

All filtered samples were divided into two separate aliquots (500 ul each; equivalent to 4.5 m2), one to be subjected to PMA pre-treatment (viability assessment), and the other to serve as a null environmental sample (viable+non-viable; total DNA). The JPL–SAF is the most frequently utilized cleanroom facility, as spacecraft assembly was underway at the time of sampling. In contrast, Bldg 144 was inactive and not in use when samples were collected. The only human traffic in the Bldg 144 facility before sampling was the janitorial servicing, which occurred once a week, or to address any other miscellaneous maintenance issues. Other metadata such as usage rate, and so on, are not in place. The dimensions of the JPL-SAF cleanroom were larger and surface area of the GSE materials were more in JPL–SAF than in Bldg 144. bThe amount of total 16S rRNA PCR product subjected to hybridization on PhyloChips was normalized across samples (∼400 ng) whenever possible. cThe total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μl for strong positives (>10 ng μl−1; all non-PMA samples), 5 μl for weak positives (5 to 10 ng μl−1; GI-42-1(p)) and 20 μl for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng μl−1; all PMA-treated samples except GI-42-1(p)). This normalization step enhanced retrieval of maximum number of sequences. An all-purpose cleaning and degreasing agent (Kleenol 30, Accurate Industrial Supply, Inc., Cerritos, CA, USA, Cat #: J-CC-00040) was used to maintain cleanliness of the floor. Surface cleaning procedures were performed twice a day in the cleanroom during periods when spacecraft componentry was actively undergoing assembly (SAF; sample #GI-36). In contrast, the quiescent Bldg 144 environmental test facility certified cleanroom was cleaned only once a week since spacecraft hardware was not present in this facility at the time of sample collection. Both of the cleanroom facilities examined were maintained with stringent protocols pertaining to the replacement of tacky mats, vacuuming and mopping of floors, and wiping down of GSE surfaces with alcohol. In addition, before entering, staff were required to don cleanroom garments and comply with appropriate practices to minimize the influx of particulate matter.Sample collection Samples were collected from the cleanroom floors and GSE housed in SAF and Bldg 144. Wet-surface sampling of the cleanroom floors and GSE (each 1 m2) was performed using biological sampling kit (BiSKit; QuickSilver Analytics, Abingdon, MD, USA) as previously described (Kwan et al., 2011). To measure indigenous DNA associated with the sampling device (negative control), 15 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0, Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was first processed through each BiSKit sampling module, with the expelled liquid pooled before using the very same kit for sample collection. The collection bottle corresponding to each BiSKit sampling module was replenished with 15 ml of sterile PBS and the entire assembly was inverted, saturating the macrofoam sponge. The sampling module of the BiSKit assembly was then used to sample floors and GSE sites in the ternary, unidirectional manner described elsewhere (Kwan et al., 2011). Overall, 36 individual samples (each 1 m2) were collected from two distinct cleanroom floors and two distinct GSE locations. A detailed description of the sample types is provided in Table 1. Sterile water, PBS, DNA extraction reagent blanks and PCR reagent blanks used in sample collection, processing and analysis, respectively, served as negative controls in all molecular analyses.Sample processing Sample volumes were extracted from BiSKit devices as instructed by the manufacturer, a total of three times with 15 ml of PBS each. Previous studies have demonstrated that spacecraft-associated surfaces house extremely low-biomass and seldom yield detectable PCR amplification products (Moissl et al., 2007; Vaishampayan et al., 2010). Hence, all samples collected from the same general location or site were pooled together. The biological materials resulting from each pooled sample (∼400 ml each) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of bacterial cells, spores and exogenous nucleic acid fragments >100 bp in a final volume of 1 ml. All filtered samples were divided into two separate aliquots (500 μl each), one to be subjected to PMA pre-treatment (viability assessment), and the other to serve as a null environmental sample (viable+non-viable; total DNA). All samples, both with and without PMA pre-treatment were subjected to DNA extraction via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and resulting DNA suspensions (100 μl each) were stored at −20 °C.PMA treatment A 500 μl aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension was treated with 12.5 μl of PMA (2 mℳ; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) to a final concentration of 50 μℳ (Rawsthorne et al., 2009; Nocker et al., 2010), followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 50 min at room temperature. The tubes were inverted manually 5–6 times over a 10-min incubation interval to promote homogeneous PMA exposure. Sample tubes were then placed horizontally atop a bed of ice and exposed to a 500-W halogen lamp (Osram 64553 C318; Danvers, MA, USA) at a distance of 20 cm for 3 min. Samples without PMA treatment were also subjected to incubation in dark for 50 min and exposure to 500-W halogen lamp on ice along with PMA-treated samples.Quantitative PCR Bacteria-directed primers (1369F and 1492R) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were used for qPCR analysis (Suzuki et al., 2000). Each 25 μl reaction mixture consisted of 12.5 μl of Bio-Rad 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Hercules, CA, USA), 10.5 μl of UltraPure water (Gibco; Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.5 μl of forward primer 1369F (10 μℳ), 0.5 μl of reverse primer 1492R (10 μℳ) and 1 μl of DNA template. Purified standards and UltraPure Gibco water no-template controls were included in all qPCR runs. Thermal cycling parameters for universal 16S rRNA gene qPCR were as follows: hold at 95 °C for 3 min to achieve initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of: 10-s hold at 95 °C to denature, ramp-down to 55 °C for primer annealing and extension occurring through a 35-s ramp-up to 95 °C. In this study, all samples were analyzed in triplicate.Taxonomy For convenience and differentiation in this communication, bTEFAP-based pyrosequence discrimination results are binned hierarchically into what are referred to as molecular operational taxonomic unit(s) (MOTU; Blaxter, 2003; Blaxter et al., 2005). Variation in DNA sequence among microbes can arise via naturally occurring evolutionary events and/or methodological errors (for example, homopolymer repetition in pyrosequencing). It is the goal of the MOTU-based classification and clustering system presented here, and in detail elsewhere (Blaxter and Floyd, 2003), to separate these two sources of sequence variation based on known error rates in sequencing and measured levels of difference across various taxonomical schemes. The accuracy and specificity of a MOTU-based system can be derived from measured levels of between-taxa and within-group variation from well-defined populations, and of observational error obtained by re-sequencing (Blaxter and Floyd, 2003). In a similar vein, PhyloChip DNA microarrays use multiple ∼25-bp probes, which collectively represent the full-length ∼1.5-kb 16S rRNA gene of each taxon. In this study, PhyloChip-derived taxonomic units (PTUs) were delineated in accordance with the hybridization scores of a given set of 25-mer probes, which have been previously designed based on the prevalence of members of a given PTU, and dissimilarity in DNA sequences outside of the given PTU. Ultimately, a microorganism can be assigned to only one given MOTU/PTU, either via similarity within a homologous sequenced DNA fragment (MOTU) or hybridization score (PTU), but neither MOTU nor PTU need be congruent with other taxonomic schemes.PhyloChip G3 Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified from DNA preparations from each sample using the primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of initial melting for 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30-s melting at 95 °C, 30-s annealing over a 48–58 °C gradient (48 °C, 48.8 °C, 50.1 °C, 51.9 °C, 54.4 °C, 56.3 °C, 57.5 °C and 58 °C), and 2-min extension at 72 °C, with a final 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The amount of total 16S rRNA gene PCR product subjected to hybridization on PhyloChips was normalized across samples (∼400 ng) whenever possible. A detailed explanation of the processing of the PhyloChip assay has been described elsewhere (Hazen et al., 2010). Stage 1 and stage 2 analysis were performed and the cross-hybridization response score was adjusted as previous described (Cooper et al., 2011).PhyloChip G3 data analysis Following stage 2 analysis, hybridization intensities were transformed (log2*1000) and were henceforth referred to as transformed hybridization intensities. Representative PTU sequences were then compared against the taxonomic architecture of the SILVA database (Pruesse et al., 2007) and PTU were grouped at the genus level. In order to be identified as having been enriched in the PMA-treated samples, PTU had to meet the following two criteria: (a) the PTU must be deemed present based on standard PhyloChip analysis in PMA-treated samples and (b) the corresponding PTU must be present in greater transformed hybridization intensity in the PMA-treated sample fraction than in the non-PMA-treated sample fraction. One representative 16S rRNA gene sequence within each PTU was selected, a multiple sequence alignment was generated with the SINA aligner (Pruesse et al., 2012), and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was compiled at the family level with MEGA 4 (Tamura et al., 2007). This tree was rendered in a circular manner with the iTOL tree viewing program (Letunic and Bork, 2011).Tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing Bacterial-biased primers 28F (5′-GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG-3′) and 519R (5′-GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3′) were used to amplify ∼500-bp fragments spanning the V1–V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. This primer pair was tailored for bTEFAP by adding a fusion linker and a proprietary 12-bp barcode sequence at the 5′ end of the forward primer, and a biotin and fusion linker sequence at the 5′ end of the reverse primer (Dowd et al., 2008). A HotStarTaq Plus master mix kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used to catalyze the PCR under the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, finalized by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. Resulting PCR products were purified via Rapid Tip (Diffinity Genomics, Inc., West Henrietta, NY, USA) chemistry, and were then pooled accordingly. Small fragments (<100 bp) were removed with Agencourt Ampure Beads in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). In preparation for FLX-Titanium sequencing (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA), resulting PCR amplicon fragment size and concentration were accurately measured with DNA 1000 chips using a Bioanalyzer 2100 automated electrophoresis station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a TBS-380 Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μl for strong positives (>10 ng μl−1), 5 μl for weak positives (5 to 10 ng μl−1) and 20 μl for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng μl−1). This normalization step helped to ensure minimal bias favoring downstream amplification from initially strong PCR products. Approximately 9.6 × 106 molecules of ∼600-bp double-stranded DNA were combined with 9.6 × 106 DNA capture beads, and then subjected to emulsion PCR conditions. Following recovery and enrichment, bead-attached DNA molecules were denatured with NaOH and sequencing primers were annealed. A 454 pyrosequencing run was performed on a GS PicoTiterPlate using the Genome Sequencer FLX System in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Roche). In all, 24 to 30 tagged samples were applied to each quarter region of the PicoTiterPlate. All bTEFAP procedures were performed at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) in accordance with well-established protocols (Dowd et al., 2008).bTEFAP-derived bacterial diversity and data analysis Bacterial TEFAP sequences were processed and analyzed using the MOTHUR software package (Schloss et al., 2009), with the AmpliconNoise algorithm implemented. Raw pyrosequencing data for the PMA-untreated samples was derived from previously published work and was re-analyzed alongside PMA-treated samples (La Duc et al., 2012). Previously described standard operating procedures were followed for the analysis of sequence data in this study (Schloss et al., 2011). Sequences were removed from consideration if they (a) did not contain the primer sequence, (b) contained an uncorrectable barcode, (c) were <200 nt in length, (d) had homopolymers longer than 8 nt or (e) had a quality score of <25. Unique sequences were aligned using the Greengenes reference alignment (Schloss et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2012) and trimmed such that all the sequences overlap in the same alignment space. Filtered sequences were assigned to samples according to their 12-nt barcode. After removing chimeras, sequences were classified in accordance with the new Greengenes training set and taxonomy (McDonald et al., 2012; Werner et al., 2012), and clustered into MOTU at the 0.03 level (that is, at 97% similarity) (Schloss et al., 2011).Negative controls During this study, a negative control whereby a BiSKit was only pre-moistened with PBS, and a handling control, in which a BiSKit was pre-moistened with PBS and exposed to the sampling environment, were also prepared. These negative and handling controls were processed and analyzed both with and without PMA treatment before DNA extraction. All of the resulting qPCR indices for these controls were below detection limit. Bacterial bTEFAP sequencing was not performed on any of these controls because PCR amplification did not yield any quantifiable product. Although no detectable PCR amplification products were available, all negative and handling controls were run on a PhyloChip in order to detect possible contaminants. The resulting 447 PTU (of 8943 PTU in total) detected were omitted from the entire analysis. Only one PTU was detected in one handling control after PMA treatment. No PTU were detected in any of the negative or sampling controls after PMA treatment, supporting the conclusion that the detected PTU originated from extraneous DNA, and not from viable microbes associated with sampling materials or reagents.Statistical analysis of community data Multiple statistical analyses were performed to study the differences between the PMA-treated and non-PMA samples, all of which were based on (a) the abundance of sequences of each MOTU and (b) the transformed hybridization intensities of each PTU. This included principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), multi-response permutation procedures and Adonis testing (999 permutations), all of which were based on Bray–Curtis distance measures. Dendogram clustering was based on Euclidean distance. Diversity indices (Shannon–Wiener) were calculated for MOTU only. All statistical analyses, including heatmaps, were performed using the R programming environment (R-project 2011, Vegan, MASS and ape packages).Results Quantitative PCR Total bacterial burden, as assessed by bacteria-directed qPCR, is given in Table 1. When PMA treatment was omitted before molecular processing, the total bacterial burden (viable+non-viable) of the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples was ∼105 to 106 rRNA gene copies m−2. Samples collected from the inactive Bldg 144 facility floor and GSE yielded 1 to 2-logs higher rRNA gene copy numbers than SAF samples both with and without PMA treatment. Following treatment with PMA, a mere 7% (floors) and 4% (GSE) of the total bacterial population encountered about the mission-critical SAF was determined to be viable. However, the bacterial population present in PMA-treated Bldg 144 samples was 21% (floors) and 7% (GSE) viable. On comparative analysis, Bldg 144 floors housed a 188-fold greater viable bacterial burden than their mission-critical SAF counterparts. Similarly, Bldg 144 GSE samples contained 25-fold more viable bacteria than their SAF GSE equivalents.bTEFAP analysis A breakdown of the number of MOTU observed in the various samples examined over the course of this study is provided in Table 1. Overall, Bldg 144 cleanroom floor samples housed 3.6-fold more bacterial MOTU than the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor, whereas the GSE surfaces from each of these cleanrooms yielded a roughly equivalent number of MOTU. The effect of PMA treatment was significantly higher in both SAF (97% MOTU reduction) and Bldg 144 (75% MOTU reduction) floor samples, which indicated the presence of a large number of dead cells or extraneous DNA on these floors. A similar trend was observed in PMA-treated GSE samples from SAF (reduced from 425 to 17 MOTU) and Bldg 144 (reduced from 571 to 42 MOTU). A breakdown of MOTU, at the level of bacterial phyla or class, observed in the various samples examined is detailed in Table 2. The mission-critical SAF floor retained MOTU affiliated with physiologically recalcitrant bacteria (Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes), whereas the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor harbored predominantly proteobacterial MOTU. It was particularly apparent that a few acidobacterial types (4 MOTU) were present in great abundance (112 sequences) in the SAF floor samples. However, the GSE samples exhibited no such correlation between MOTU numbers and sequence occurrence. A closer examination of the pyrosequence reads resulting from the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples indicated a predominance of members of the genera: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Arsenicicoccus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Kineococcus, Propionibacterium, Nocardioides, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Deinococcus and Staphylococcus. Many of the sequences arising from the physiologically recalcitrant bacteria observed in cleanroom floor samples sans PMA treatment were absent or in very low number in the PMA-treated fractions of the very same sample.

Regardless of sample type, PMA-treated sample fractions consistently yielded considerably fewer pyrosequences than their untreated counterparts. Anywhere from 14 to 2196 high-quality pyrosequences (>250 bp) were obtained from samples that had been pre-treated with PMA, whereas 1783 to 15 914 high-quality pyrosequences were recovered from untreated samples. Even when PMA treatment was omitted, the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (GI-36-4) yielded far fewer pyrosequences (1783 reads) than the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor sample (GI-42-1; 15 914 reads). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the PMA-untreated cleanroom floor samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1a. Approximately 65% of the pyrosequences retrieved from these two distinct facility floor samples were detected in both cleanrooms, although this shared fraction represented only 8% of the total observed MOTU (46 out of 569; Figure 1a). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the untreated SAF samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1b. Between the SAF floor and GSE samples, ∼38% of the total number of detected pyrosequence reads were shared, although this constituted a mere 7.8% of the total MOTU (43 out of 547). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Venn diagram showing the MOTU detected in various samples of the cleanrooms. Comparison (a) between SAF and Bldg 144 cleanroom floor samples and (b) between floor and GSE samples of SAF cleanroom. Parentheses denote total number of pyrosequences generated and the numerals without parentheses are total number of MOTU present in that sample.PhyloChip analysis A drastic decrease in the total number of bacterial genera was observed in all samples on pre-treatment with PMA (Table 1). After having been treated with PMA, the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples exhibited very simple bacterial community structure, housing very few genera (9 and 3, respectively) of Firmicute and Proteobacteria lineage. Without PMA treatment, these very same floor and GSE samples yielded many more genera, which represented a diverse assemblage of taxa (Table 3) dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The Bldg 144 cleanroom floor and GSE samples also presented many more genera without PMA pre-treatment (199 and 236, respectively) than the very same samples having been treated with PMA (106 and 75).

Such analysis clearly illustrates a marked decrease in the hybridization scores of all samples treated with PMA, as compared with the very same samples not treated with PMA. For instance, the SAF GSE sample (GI-36-3) exhibited very high transformed hybridization intensities for detected PTU sans PMA treatment. However, when treated with PMA, this very same sample showed a dramatic reduction in all resulting hybridization intensity scores, which suggested that the majority of the detected 16S rRNA genes arose from deceased members of the community. In order to identify the viable members that exhibited increased hybridization intensities after PMA treatment, ratios of non-PMA-treated and PMA-treated hybridization scores were calculated for each PTU, and are presented as a heatmap (Figure 2). An observed increase in the transformed hybridization intensity of a given PTU following PMA treatment would likely stem from PCR bias in non-PMA-treated samples, where high levels of DNA originating from non-viable cells are co-amplified. This amplification of template DNA arising from non-viable cell types masks the presence of smaller levels of DNA template arising from viable cells. Hence, transformed hybridization intensities are elevated on removing the template DNA arising from non-viable cells from the equation (that is, PMA-treated sample fraction). The SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples gave rise to fewer PTU with higher transformed hybridization ratios. At the same time, PMA-treated Bldg 144 cleanroom samples were richer in PTU having increased transformed hybridization intensity ratios, which was indicative of a relatively greater viable population. These PTU belonged to the Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. A phylogenetic tree of PhyloChip PTU grouped at the family level is provided as Supplementary Figure 2, which shows the presence of the detected families in each sample with and without PMA treatment. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Heatmap of PTU that increased in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated samples compared with non-PMA-treated samples and were called present in the PMA-treated sample. An increase in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated sample is reflected as a positive ratio. In total, 801 PTU were identified that fulfilled this requirement, which were grouped into 70 genera. Displayed are representatives of all genera with the most drastic changes for each sample pair. Numbers in parentheses are the total number of PTU.Statistical analysis of microbial community profiles The various samples examined by bTEFAP analysis consistently showed lower Shannon–Wiener diversity indices when treated with PMA compared with their corresponding non-treated samples (Supplementary Table 1). PCoA was performed to study the environmental clustering and relatedness of community profiles derived from bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses (Figure 3). All of the samples analyzed without PMA treatment clustered together, indicative of their relatively similar community structure, compared with their coinciding PMA-treated sample fractions. The clustering observed in the PCoA plot was congruent with the dendogram clustering presented in Supplementary Figure 1, which implied a close association among all non-PMA samples. Multi-response permutation procedure analysis was performed to assess the difference in community structure between PMA-treated sample fractions and non-PMA-treated sample fractions, derived by both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analysis. The null hypothesis (no difference in PMA-treated and non-PMA-treated samples) was rejected based on the significance of the delta for both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses (0.028 and 0.037, respectively). The chance-corrected within-group agreements were fairly low for bTEFAP sequence data (A=0.0411) but high (A=0.2605) for PhyloChip data, which reflect the observed grouping in PCoA. In addition, Adonis testing clearly showed a significant change in the detected community profiles after PMA treatment (P-value bTEFAP: 0.04, P-value PhyloChip: 0.02). Based on the multiple statistical approaches used, such as Adonis, multi-response permutation procedure, a Euclidean distance-based dendogram (Supplementary Figure 1), and ordination (PCoA) analyses (Figure 3), it was clear that PMA-treated samples and non-PMA samples were significantly dissimilar with respect to diversity in bacterial community profiles. Figure 3. Open in a new tab PCoA based on: (a) number of pyrosequences per MOTU (PCoA1, percentage of explained variance: 22% PCoA2, percentage of explained variance: 17%) and (b) PhyloChip-derived transformed hybridization scores of each PTU (PCoA1, percentage of explained variance: 87% PCoA2, percentage of explained variance: 6%). Open and closed dots represent PMA-treated and PMA-non-treated samples, respectively.Discussion Over the past 25 years, sequence analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes has become the ‘gold standard' for assessing species richness in mixed microbial communities, and as a result, total resolvable microbial diversity is now estimated to be threefold greater than that based solely on cultivation (Pace, 1997). As sequences from organisms in greatest abundance are far more likely to be represented in clone libraries than those from singleton and low-abundance taxa, it is advantageous to use high-throughput technologies, such as bTEFAP and PhyloChip, which have been shown to render a far superior representation of community structure (Brodie et al., 2006; Sogin et al., 2006; DeSantis et al., 2007; La Duc et al., 2009). The application of PMA to assess the differential viability of microbial cells is increasing in popularity within the scientific community (Nocker et al., 2009; van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2011). When used to pre-treat samples, the PMA concentration applied in this study effectively precluded ∼90% of the total DNA template molecules from downstream manipulation, resulting in the generation of only 2827 pyrosequences, whereas 27 449 pyrosequences were obtained from the very same samples without PMA pre-treatment. With respect to diversity, all of the pyrosequences generated after PMA treatment represented a mere 171 MOTU, which corresponded to ∼12% of the total number of MOTU resulting from the very same samples without PMA treatment (Table 2). Furthermore, 2- to 3-logs fewer pyrosequences arose from PMA-treated than untreated mission-critical cleanroom samples (0.8% for floor; 2.1% for GSE). The total number of MOTU observed in the operational mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (122 MOTU) was considerably less than that associated with the quiescent Bldg 144 cleanroom floor (447 MOTU). Bioinformatic analyses of pyrosequence data demonstrated that both of these contaminant microbial populations comprised only Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The vast majority of these bacteria, if not all, were present in the SAF mission-critical cleanroom floor samples in a non-viable state. However, about 25% of the detected MOTU (108 out of 447) were observed to be viable in the Bldg 144 facility, suggesting that certain taxa are able to withstand the desiccated and nutrient-deprived conditions of these cleanroom floors (sample #GI-42-1). Actinobacterial genera such as Kineococcus, Kocuria, Modestobacter and Propionibacterium were present in high abundance in the JPL-SAF floor samples. In contrast, the floors of the Bldg 144 facility housed predominantly Proteobacterial genera, as Brevendimonas and Acinetobacter pyrosequences were generated in great numbers. Previously, members of these and other closely related genera have been isolated from spacecraft assembly environments (Osman et al., 2008; La Duc et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2010; Vaishampayan et al., 2012). The molecular biological detection and isolation of these robust microbial lineages from spacecraft-associated environments is of particular consequence to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) planetary protection practices, not to mention routine validation of these cleanroom facilities. Unlike cleanroom floors, which were treated with Kleenol 30 detergent, the GSE materials housed in either cleanroom were subjected only to alcohol wiping, and yet gave rise to similar MOTU and pyrosequence occurrence, with GSE materials kept at the Bldg 144 facility marginally enriched (∼1.3-fold increase in pyrosequences and MOTU). From these results, it is apparent that GSE need to be subjected to more rigorous cleaning regimens, as GSE-associated richness was two to four times greater than that of the floor surfaces. The most frequently encountered bacterial MOTU from the stringently maintained and frequently cleaned floors of the SAF cleanroom were members of the genera: Bacillus, Clostridium and Nocardia. These bacteria are known to survive oligotrophic conditions for extended periods of time, tolerate alkaline and oxidative stress, and avoid death by ultraviolet radiation by morphing into highly resilient, dormant endospores (La Duc et al., 2007; Ghosh et al., 2010; Probst et al., 2010). Although routine cleaning and maintenance regimens limit the number of bacterial taxa capable of persisting in cleanrooms, hardy spore-forming microorganisms like Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp. and Nocardia spp. capitalize on their selective advantage and superior fitness and survive—much to the chagrin of those challenged with bioreduction and sterilization of these environments. The presence of these organisms is detected as a result of their (a) viability, or (b) inability to be penetrated by PMA molecules while in a non-viable state. Owing to subtle nuances inherent in the PMA-chemistry-coupled techniques described herein, endospores and non-viable cells having intact cell walls and/or outer membranes will escape PMA treatment (Nocker et al., 2009; Rawsthorne et al., 2009; Probst et al., 2012), and thus be observed as false-positive viable entities. Similarly, sampling and sample processing steps (for example, the composition of the solution to collect and store microorganisms, method for cell concentration and PMA treatment) might affect the viability of the cells but in a recent study such adverse effect of sample handling procedures was not noticed for sea and canal water samples (Kort et al., 2010; Nocker et al., 2010). As was observed via bTEFAP procedures, PhyloChip-based analyses discerned noticeable differences in the bacterial diversity profiles resulting from PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples. One such observation was the reduction in diversity of proteobacteria detected in PMA-treated samples and prevalence of proteobacteria in samples not treated with PMA. Another consistent result was the observed prevalence of Firmicutes in the PMA-treated samples. This suggests that Gram-positive bacteria are more tolerable of the inhospitable conditions of the cleanroom environment that their Gram-negative kin. Numerous studies have reported varying accounts of the microbial diversity typical of spacecraft-associated cleanrooms, and what the presence of such communities might portend for life detection endeavors in extraterrestrial settings (Venkateswaran et al., 2001; La Duc et al., 2004, 2007; Moissl et al., 2007; Probst et al., 2010; Vaishampayan et al., 2010). Indeed, the introduction of contaminant microbes to extraterrestrial environments could have profound repercussions on (a) the scientific integrity of in situ and sample-return based life detection experiments, and (b) the uncompromised nature of such settings. The worst-case scenario for life-detection experimentation would be the inadvertent transfer of viable contaminant microbiota to an otherwise pristine location of interest. The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest that hitherto, the breadth of diversity enveloped within the viable fraction(s) of typical spacecraft-associated microbial communities have been overestimated. At the same time, these findings enabled the first ever statistically significant differentiation between the total and viable-only portion of microbial communities in cleanroom environments. Significant differences were shown between these two populations using two independent profiling methods, namely bTEFAP and PhyloChip G3. Consequently, these methodologies are an attractive means of discerning viable phylotypes in low-biomass environments. Such a capability is of crucial importance and benefit to numerous industries (for example, healthcare, pharma, semiconductor fabrication), not least of all the NASA, whose planetary protection program is tasked with ensuring spacecraft-borne microorganisms do not result in harmful contamination of extraterrestrial environments.Acknowledgments Part of the research described in this study was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to global public health and years of progress made towards ending TB have been reversed by the COVID19 pandemic [1]. Predictive preclinical models for testing novel drugs and vaccine candidates are required to achieve the targets set forth in the End TB Strategy. Laboratory mice have played a critical role in TB preclinical therapy development and studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) immunopathology. However, they do not always align closely with clinical observations [2, 3]. Most of the common mouse strains used in research have been inbred for many decades under specific pathogen-free conditions in a controlled environment without dietary variations that led to a loss in microbiota diversity and richness [4]. Moreover, laboratory animals are not exposed to microbes that wild-living mice constantly encounter. Several studies have highlighted that exposure to microbes and pathogens, including mites and pinworms, and the presence of the wild mouse microbiota may improve the translational value of murine models and better reflect human immune responses [4–8]. However, introduction of murine pathogens to research poses significant challenges for laboratory animal facilities and is often prohibitive because such pathogens are notoriously difficult to contain [9]. Rosshart et al. have defined the wild mouse gut microbiota, which was significantly more diverse and various species were differentially represented as compared to conventional laboratory mice [4]. Reconstitution of germ-free laboratory mice with the wild-mouse gut microbiota enabled their offspring, termed “WildR” by vertical transfer, to experience microbiota-mediated effects before and after birth [10, 11]. The gut microbiota of WildR mice was stable over several generations, promoted host fitness and improved disease resistance to influenza virus infection and mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis [4]. A recent study showed that previous intestinal infections in WildR mice increase the gut microbiota’s resistance to subsequent infections by inhibiting pathogen respiration [12]. Taken altogether, WildR mice have demonstrated translational value in several research fields owing to their wild mouse gut microbiota. The onset and recurrence of active TB infection in humans are characterized by a decline in the diversity of the gut microbiota [13, 14]. Similarly, mice experience a rapid loss of fecal microbiota diversity upon Mtb infection [15]. Depletion of the microbiome by broad-spectrum antibiotics rendered mice more susceptible to TB and restoring the gut microbiota by fecal transfer reduced the bacterial load of Mtb [16]. Chemotherapy with first-line antimycobacterials led to dysbiosis that persisted beyond the end of drug treatment for at least 3 months in Mtb-infected mice and at least 1.2 years in TB patients [17, 18]. Taken altogether, the crosstalk through the gut-lung axis is bidirectional and impacts both Mtb in the lung and the microbial community of the gut. Because there are striking differences between the microbiota of laboratory mice and wild-living mice, we examine whether laboratory mice reconstituted with the wild-mouse gut microbiome may better resemble the hallmarks of clinical TB than conventional laboratory mice. We chose the BALB/c mouse as the host organism for our studies as this strain is widely used in TB preclinical development. Here we investigate the impact of the wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB infection in the BALB/c model using organ bacterial burden, lung histopathology, microbiome changes, cytokine profiles, and T cell responses as readouts.",

    "results": "Results WildR mice control initial acute TB lung infection better than conventional mice We used commercially available age-matched cohorts of LabC mice and WildR mice [10, 11] that were generated in the BALB/c background. To study the impact of wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB, we simultaneously infected both cohorts in the same aerosol generator chamber by a low dose of aerosolized Mtb. Strict separation between the two animal groups was maintained during the infection process and throughout the experiment to prevent microbiome transfer. We verified delivery of the initial inoculum dose at 24 h post-infection and monitored the progress of TB thereafter by determining the pathogen load of organs at 14, 28 and 56 days. The study design is depicted in Fig 1A. The course of low dose Mtb infection in mice can be divided into the acute phase characterized by rapid Mtb growth (until ~4 weeks), and the chronic phase during which a high pathogen load in organs is maintained [32]. The lungs of WildR mice at 1 day and 14 days post-infection had a significantly lower bacterial burden than LabC mice, and this difference dissipated thereafter (Fig 1B left). In contrast, animals of both cohorts had a similar pathogen load in the spleen at individual time points (Fig 1B right). This suggests that the gut microbiota may shape innate immunity leading to different degrees of TB control in WildR mice and LabC mice in the early time points following infection. Dissemination of TB to secondary organs such as the spleen was not affected by the gut microbiota. Fig 1. WildR mice control acute pulmonary TB infection better than LabC mice.

At designated time points, half of the organs of 6 mice per cohort were homogenized and plated on agar to determine the pathogen load in lungs (left panel) and spleen (right panel) over time.

TB infection affects the composition of the LabC and WildR gut microbiome The conventional BALB/c mouse model is widely used in TB research, including preclinical development of novel therapies. Laboratory mice have been bred under specific pathogen-free conditions for many generations which led to alteration of their gut microbiota, and consequently, changes in their immune responses relative to wild living mice [8]. It has been reported that TB infection has a profound impact on the gut microbiota of humans and mice [13, 14]. To investigate whether the gut microbiota impacts the course of TB in the BALB/c model, we used animals born to germ-free mothers that were inoculated with the gut microbiota of wild-living mice, and age-matched conventional BALB/c mice. Fecal samples obtained from individual mice of both cohorts prior to and during TB infection were subjected to DNA isolation and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. DADA2 denoising of paired-end reads identified an average of 102,631 (± 7,160) amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) per sample (S1 Table). Microbial community analysis of LabC and WildR gut microbiomes revealed that the two communities were similar in community richness prior to and during acute TB infection but were both reduced during chronic infection (Fig 2A). LabC and WildR communities significantly differed in microbial composition prior to and during TB infection suggesting that TB infection induced a dysbiosis of the gut microbiome regardless of the initial community structure (Fig 2B). In support of this, we assessed the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of samples collected during TB infection compared to pre-infection samples. Infection with TB significantly increased the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of microbial community relative to pre-infection samples within the first 14 days of infection and persisted through day 56 (Fig 2C). This TB-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been previously reported in both human and mouse TB infections (reviewed in [33]). Fig 2.

At the phylum level, Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes) and Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria) were dominant in WildR mice, whereas Bacillota (formerly Firmicutes) and Actinobacteriodota were enriched in the LabC mice. Verrucomicrobiota and Campylobacterota were only detected in LabC and WildR mice, respectively. Members of the Bacillota phylum including Ruminococcus (Family Ruminococcaceae), Butyricicoccus (Family Butyricicoccaceae), and multiple Lachnospiraceae groups were enriched in LabC mice. LabC mice also exhibited a higher proportion of Roseburia compared to WildR mice. Interestingly, Roseburia are butyrate-producing bacteria that are associated with beneficial health outcomes in mice and in humans [34]. WildR mice were enriched for Odoribacter (Family Marinifilaceae), Helicobacter (Family Helicobacteraceae), and genera within the Rikenellaceae family. The sulfur-reducing genera Bilophila and Desulfovibrio were also differentially abundant in WildR mice. A full list of differentially abundant taxa at the phylum, family, and genus levels is provided in S2 Table. Our findings in the BALB/c WildR model are consistent with the C57BL/6 WildR mice [4]. LabC mice and WildR mice develop comparable pulmonary TB histopathology The gut microbiota of WildR mice was shown to promote host fitness and improve resistance to influenza infection [4]. To examine whether the microbiome impacts the lung histopathology of TB, we compared H&E-stained lung sections of LabC mice and WildR mice at 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection. Typical TB lung lesions in conventional BALB/c mice are cellular and consist of lymphocyte aggregates, epithelioid histocytes and intra-alveolar foamy macrophages [35–37]. At 14 days post-infection lymphocytes had accumulated in the lungs of LabC mice and WildR mice, mostly around larger airways (Fig 3A). At 28 days post-infection, unstructured cellular lesions were present, with a diameter often exceeding 0.5 mm that further increased until the end of the study at 56 days (Fig 3A). Foamy macrophages appearing more transparent due to their accumulation of lipid bodies filled out many alveolar spaces and were infected with acid-fast bacilli (Fig 3A, two right panels). The representation of TB lung pathology in both cohorts was very similar (Fig 3A, top and bottom row) and closely resembled reports in conventional BALB/c mice [35–37]. We then quantified the number of pulmonary immune cell infiltrates in H&E-stained sections. As expected, the number of TB lesions increased over the course of infection reaching 45 to 55 infiltrates per animal at the end of the study with no significant difference between the two cohorts (Fig 3B). We conclude that the wild mouse gut microbiome does not impact the number of lung lesions and the lesion organization in the BALB/c model. Fig 3. Pulmonary histopathology of TB is independent of the intestinal microbiome. Open in a new tab A. At 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection lungs of animals were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 3 μm, mounted on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin & eosin (eight panels on the left) or Ziehl-Neelsen (two panels on the right) and examined by brightfield microscopy. Acid-fast positive bacilli are shown as purple rods. Representative areas of LabC mice and WildR mice are shown. B. All lung lobes of two mice per cohort were completely sectioned with 50 μm steps between individual sections. Pulmonary infiltrates with a diameter of >100 μm were quantified. Infiltrates present in multiple sections were only counted once. Data are shown as mean and SD. The unpaired student’s t-test was used to perform pairwise comparisons at designated time points. Sections of all lung lobes at designated time points are shown in S2 Fig. WildR mice have a less pronounced T cell response during acute TB infection T cells play an essential role in controlling TB infection [38] and growing evidence suggest that T-cell responses can be shaped by the microbiota [39]. To determine the impact of the gut microbiota on T cell immunity to TB, we measured the dynamics of CD4, CD8 and γδ T cells during acute and chronic infection. WildR and LabC mice showed a robust expansion of pulmonary and splenic T cell subsets in response to TB infection (Fig 4A and 4B), which is consistent with the literature [40]. At 14 days post-infection, lungs of WildR mice had lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells than LabC mice and these differences faded to undetectable levels at later time points (Fig 4A). Similarly, WildR mice has slightly less γδ T-cells in the lungs at 28 days (Fig 4A). In the spleen, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts were on par throughout the experiment (Fig 4B). In addition, lungs of WildR mice had slightly more γδ T-cells than LabC mice at days 14 post-infection (Fig 4B). CD4 and CD8 T cells represented the majority of T-cell populations in WildR and LabC mice during infection (Fig 4C). WildR mice generally had a less pronounced T-cell response in the lungs at early time points, compared to LabC mice, and a comparable T-cell response in the spleen throughout the TB infections. Fig 4. WildR mice have a less pronounced T cell response in the lungs during acute TB infection.

Unpaired Student’s t-tests were performed for pairwise analysis of T cell subsets of four LabC mice and four WildR mice at 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection. *p<0.05, **p<0.001. E. Flow cytometry markers used in this study and definitions of analyzed T cell subsets.We also examined the protein levels of 23 cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and spleen of LabC and WildR mice at the acute and chronic phases of TB infection. Most cytokine and chemokine levels were much higher in the lungs than in the spleens (S1 Fig). We thus performed principal component analysis to explore if different gut microbiomes would affect cytokine expressions in response to TB infection (Fig 5). Cytokine profiles of mice from the same time points tend to cluster together regardless of their gut microbiome. This suggested that measured cytokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In summary, our data shows that the fecal microbiome impacts early T cell responses during acute infection which did not translate into changes in the cytokine profiles. Fig 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion The BALB/c mouse model has been a workhorse in TB preclinical therapy development for many decades, but results do not always align with humans. Mice having the gut microbiota of their wild-living relatives have better host fitness, improved disease resistance and might model humans more closely [4]. Here we tested whether introducing the wild mouse gut microbiota to the BALB/c host (WildR) would alter the representation and course of TB infection. Conventional BALB/c mice with the microbiome of continuously inbred animals (LabC) served as a reference. Consistent with previous reports, the compositions of the intestinal microbiomes of LabC and WildR mice had differently composed microbial gut communities (Fig 2D) [4]. The WildR mice were enrichen in Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota, whereas Bacillota and Actinobacteriodota were enriched in the LabC mice. Both LabC mice and WildR mice had microbiome taxa that are not common in specific pathogen free research environments and might be specific to our animal supplier’s facility. Helicobacter and Odoribacter were enriched in WildR mice. Colonization of the murine gut with Helicobacter hepaticus was associated with increased Mtb growth, elevated inflammation through CD4 and CD8 T cell activation [41] and more sever pulmonary pathology [42]. In contrast, Helicobacter pylori infection was associated with immunoprotection against TB in macaques and in humans [43]. The presence of Helicobacter species (H. bilis, H. ganmani, H. hepaticus, H. mastomyrinus, H. rodentium, H. typhlonius) that are part of the WildR gut microbiota [4] were beneficial or had no impact on TB infection in our studies. TB infection caused a major perturbation of the intestinal microbiome of both cohorts and induced a significant loss in community richness during the chronic infection stage (Fig 2A). Roseburia species, were more abundant in LabC mice than in WildR mice. The higher abundance of Roseburia might be beneficial for mice during chronic TB infections [34]. Our data is consistent with previous reports indicating significant differences in the relative abundance of members of the Lachospiraceae family in response to TB infection [15]. LabC mice showed the typical biphasic course of pulmonary TB infection, including the acute phase until day 28 followed by the chronic phase [32]. While in principle WildR mice phenocopied the pathogen kinetics of LabC mice, the number of bacilli detected in lungs was lower at 1- and 14-days post-infection (Fig 1B). The observed difference in lungs did not impact dissemination to the spleen (Fig 1C). Both cohorts share the same genetic background, were age-matched and were infected simultaneously in one infection chamber while maintaining strict separation between microbiomes. Therefore, a comparable Mtb dose was likely deposited in lungs of all study animals. The lower lung bacterial load we observed at 1- and 14-days in WildR cohort might indicate a better early innate immune control in these mice, which quickly faded at later study time points (Fig 1B). The axis of innate immunity and the microbiome is an area of ongoing research [44–46]. Germ-free mice for instance have a profoundly altered innate immune system and the gut is a signal hub that integrates environmental inputs to affect immunity and the response to infection [47]. The communication of the intestinal microbiota and innate immunity is bidirectional [48]. In line with this, we find that Mtb triggers gut microbiota dysbiosis, and in turn the wild mouse microbiome may have impacted the early events of TB infection when innate immune responses dominate. Growing evidence suggests that TB susceptibility is impacted by the microbial community in the gut (reviewed in [49]) and our results further support this key finding. The lower pathogen load in the lungs of WildR mice at 14 days post-infection did not translate into a measurable difference in pulmonary histopathology including the number of lesions and their organization and the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in our studies correlated with the organ bacterial load rather than the microbiome changes (Figs 3 and 4). The cytokine and chemokine profiles we measured in infected organs of LabC and WildR mice showed a large overlap (S1 Fig). A principal component analysis of data revealed a clear separation of animals by time points post-infection but not between microbiomes (Fig 5), demonstrating that cytokine and chemokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In a high-dose influenza A infection model using C57BL/6 mice, the wild mouse gut microbiota led to significant changes in cytokine profiles and was protective [4]. Such high-dose pathogen models typically assess immunity in a short time window after inoculation which was not the focus of our experiments. The nature of the infectious agent, the vastly different inoculation dose, the mouse strain and the choice of experimental endpoints may have contributed to the lack of cytokine profile changes in our studies. In summary, TB infection in BALB/c mice causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiome regardless of the initial community structure. WildR mice control initial acute infection (low pathogen burden) better, possibly through enhanced immunity. With the onset of chronic TB characterized by a high pathogen load however, this advantage fades over the course of infection. Further studies are required to elucidate how the intestinal microbiome shapes immunity in the BALB/c model.",

Copyright notice ID: 10370681 PMID: 37494371 Abstract Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to global public health and years of progress made towards ending TB have been reversed by the COVID19 pandemic [1]. Predictive preclinical models for testing novel drugs and vaccine candidates are required to achieve the targets set forth in the End TB Strategy. Laboratory mice have played a critical role in TB preclinical therapy development and studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) immunopathology. However, they do not always align closely with clinical observations [2, 3]. Most of the common mouse strains used in research have been inbred for many decades under specific pathogen-free conditions in a controlled environment without dietary variations that led to a loss in microbiota diversity and richness [4]. Moreover, laboratory animals are not exposed to microbes that wild-living mice constantly encounter. Several studies have highlighted that exposure to microbes and pathogens, including mites and pinworms, and the presence of the wild mouse microbiota may improve the translational value of murine models and better reflect human immune responses [4–8]. However, introduction of murine pathogens to research poses significant challenges for laboratory animal facilities and is often prohibitive because such pathogens are notoriously difficult to contain [9]. Rosshart et al. have defined the wild mouse gut microbiota, which was significantly more diverse and various species were differentially represented as compared to conventional laboratory mice [4]. Reconstitution of germ-free laboratory mice with the wild-mouse gut microbiota enabled their offspring, termed “WildR” by vertical transfer, to experience microbiota-mediated effects before and after birth [10, 11]. The gut microbiota of WildR mice was stable over several generations, promoted host fitness and improved disease resistance to influenza virus infection and mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis [4]. A recent study showed that previous intestinal infections in WildR mice increase the gut microbiota’s resistance to subsequent infections by inhibiting pathogen respiration [12]. Taken altogether, WildR mice have demonstrated translational value in several research fields owing to their wild mouse gut microbiota. The onset and recurrence of active TB infection in humans are characterized by a decline in the diversity of the gut microbiota [13, 14]. Similarly, mice experience a rapid loss of fecal microbiota diversity upon Mtb infection [15]. Depletion of the microbiome by broad-spectrum antibiotics rendered mice more susceptible to TB and restoring the gut microbiota by fecal transfer reduced the bacterial load of Mtb [16]. Chemotherapy with first-line antimycobacterials led to dysbiosis that persisted beyond the end of drug treatment for at least 3 months in Mtb-infected mice and at least 1.2 years in TB patients [17, 18]. Taken altogether, the crosstalk through the gut-lung axis is bidirectional and impacts both Mtb in the lung and the microbial community of the gut. Because there are striking differences between the microbiota of laboratory mice and wild-living mice, we examine whether laboratory mice reconstituted with the wild-mouse gut microbiome may better resemble the hallmarks of clinical TB than conventional laboratory mice. We chose the BALB/c mouse as the host organism for our studies as this strain is widely used in TB preclinical development. Here we investigate the impact of the wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB infection in the BALB/c model using organ bacterial burden, lung histopathology, microbiome changes, cytokine profiles, and T cell responses as readouts.Materials and methods Ethics statement This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hackensack Meridian Health (Protocol Number: 265) and all efforts were made to minimize suffering and pain.Bacterial strains and media Mtb H37Rv (ATCC #27294) was cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80, 0.2% glycerol and 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Becton Dickinson) at 37°C and 80 rpm or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing 0.5% glycerol and 10% oleic-acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Becton Dickinson) at 37°C. Colonies were counted after 3–4 weeks of incubation.Aerosol infection of mice and pathogen load determination Cohorts of 8–9 weeks old female BALB/c mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the gut microbiota of wild-living mice, termed WildR herein, and age-matched conventional laboratory BALB/c females, termed LabC, were obtained from Taconic and maintained under sterile conditions using individually ventilated cages. Both cohorts were simultaneously infected while maintaining strict separation. The infection dose of 100–200 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerosolized Mtb H37Rv was delivered by a whole-body inhalation exposure system (Glas-Col) and verified 3 h post-infection [15]. The bacterial loads of lungs and spleens were determined by plating serial dilutions of individual organs homogenized in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/0.05% Tween 80 onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar.Feces collection, DNA extraction, 16S rRNA library preparation and sequencing Up to 2 pieces of feces from individual mice were sterilely collected, heat inactivated and subjected to bead-beating using Lysing Matrix B, 0.1 mm silica spheres (MP Biomedicals). DNA was extracted using a column-based DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Final DNA concentrations and quality were determined by fluorometric analysis (Qubit 2.0 Invitrogen) using quant-iT BR dsDNA reagent kits (Invitrogen) and normalized to a uniform concentration and volume. Microbial 16S rRNA amplicons were constructed by amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene with universal primers previously developed against the V4 region, flanked by Illumina standard adapter sequences [19, 20]. Dual-indexed forward and reverse primers were used in all reactions. Amplicon pools at equal concentrations were combined, thoroughly mixed, and purified using Axyprep MagPCR clean-up beads (Axygen) prior to final analysis on a fragment analyzer automated electrophoresis system (Advanced Analytical). Amplicon pools were then diluted following Illumina’s standard protocol for sequencing on a MiSeq instrument generating 2x250 bp paired-end reads.Informatics analysis 16S rRNA amplicon sequences were processed using Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) [21] v2021.8. Briefly, forward and reverse reads were timed of the universal (515F/806R) primers using cutadapt [22]. If found, the reverse complement of the primer to the reverse read was then removed from the forward reads as were all bases downstream. Thus, a forward read could be trimmed at both ends if the insert was shorter than the amplicon length. The same approach was taken on reverse read, but with the primer ins in the opposite role. Read pairs were rejected if one read or the other did not match a 5’ primer, and an error rate of 0.1 was allowed. Two passes were made over each read to ensure the removal of the second primer. A minimal overlap of 3 bases with the 3’ end of the primer sequence was required for removal. DADA2 (q2-dada2) was used to denoise, de-replicate, and count amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) incorporating the following parameters: (i) forward and reverse reads were truncated to 150 bases; (ii) forward and reverse reads with the number of expected errors higher than 2.0 were discarded; and (iii) chimeras were detected using the “consensus” method and removed. ASVs were filtered to between 249 and 257 bp in length. Taxonomies were assigned to final sequences using the Silva V138 16S (515F/806R) rRNA SSU reference database [23] using the classify-sklearn procedure. Microbiome data were analyzed using the open-source R statistical software v4.2.2 [24]. The DADA2-generated feature table was rarefied to 87,953 total features per sample using the rrarefy function from the vegan library [25, 26]. Community richness (i.e., number of unique taxa within a community) was determined using the microbiome library [27]. To assess differences in community composition between samples, a distance matrix was first generated from a quarter-root-transformed feature table with Bray-Curtis distance metrics. A principal coordinate analysis of the distance matrix was then performed using the pcoa function from the ape [28] library with a Calliez correction. Statistical differences in community composition were determined using the adonis2 function from the vegan library [25, 26] which performs a two-way permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Differential abundance testing was performed using ALDEx2 [29] with the recommended 128 Monte Carlo simulations. Differentially abundant features were determined based on a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test p value < 0.05.Bacterial load of organs and histopathology analysis Organs of euthanized animals were aseptically collected. Half of the spleen and the left lung lobe were homogenized individually in gentleMACS M tubes (Miltenyi) with 1 ml PBS/0.05% Tween 80 using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi). Subsequently, serial dilutions of organ homogenates were plated on Middlebrook 7H11 agar. For histopathology analysis entire lungs of two mice were perfused with 10 ml PBS and fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Organs were processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm thickness with 50 μm between pairs of two adjacent sections throughout the organ. Each pair of sections was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and to Ziehl-Neelsen staining, respectively. Histology slides were imaged using a 3D HiStech slide scanner (Pannoramic Desk) to quantify the number of immune cell infiltrates per slide. Images of pathology details were taken using a NiE Research Microscope equipped with CFI Plan APO Lambda objectives and NIS-Elements AR Software (Nikon Instruments).Multiplex cytokine analysis of organ homogenates Organ homogenates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge and the supernatants were sterilized by passing them twice through 0.22 μm Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filters (Corning). For cytokine profiling, we utilized the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex mouse cytokine assay (BioRAD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and the FLEXMAP 3D system (Luminex) for data acquisition. The instrument was calibrated, and performance was verified using the FLEXMAP 3D Calibration Kit and the FLEXMAP 3D Performance Verification Kit (Luminex) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Raw data was analyzed using the Belysa Immunoassay Curve-Fitting software V1.0.19 (Merck) and the GraphPad Prism 11 software was used to visualize cytokine profiles and to perform statistical analysis. Principal component analysis was performed in R v.4.2.0 (2022-04-22) with Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit). The following R packages were used: dplyr (v.1.0.9), ggplot2 (v.3.3.6) [30, 31].Preparation of single cell suspension, cell staining and flow cytometry analysis The superior-, middle-, inferior- and postcaval-lung lobes were dissociated with 2.5 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium (RPMI)/53 μg liberase (Roche) in C tubes using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi). The tissue suspension was then incubated for 1 h at 37°C and single cells were counted using an automatic instrument (Lunar II). For cell surface staining, ~2 million cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% sodium azide). Cells were first incubated with Live/Dead Fixable Near-IR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing, cells were incubated for 30 min with a cocktail of fluorochrome-conjugated specific antibodies at appropriate concentrations: anti-mouse CD45 Alexa Fluor 700 (clone 30-F11, Biolegend), anti-mouse CD3 BV605 (clone 17A2, Biolegend), anti-mouse CD4 BUV395 (clone GK1.5, BD), anti-mouse CD8a BB700 (clone 53–6.7, BD), anti-mouse γδTCR FITC (clone GL3, Biolegend) and anti-mouse B220 BUV496 (clone RA3-6B2, BD). Cells were then washed, fixed for 60 min with Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation and Permeabilization Solution (BD Biosciences) and then acquired on a FACSymphony A3 Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo Software V10.8.1 (BD Biosciences).Results WildR mice control initial acute TB lung infection better than conventional mice We used commercially available age-matched cohorts of LabC mice and WildR mice [10, 11] that were generated in the BALB/c background. To study the impact of wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB, we simultaneously infected both cohorts in the same aerosol generator chamber by a low dose of aerosolized Mtb. Strict separation between the two animal groups was maintained during the infection process and throughout the experiment to prevent microbiome transfer. We verified delivery of the initial inoculum dose at 24 h post-infection and monitored the progress of TB thereafter by determining the pathogen load of organs at 14, 28 and 56 days. The study design is depicted in Fig 1A. The course of low dose Mtb infection in mice can be divided into the acute phase characterized by rapid Mtb growth (until ~4 weeks), and the chronic phase during which a high pathogen load in organs is maintained [32]. The lungs of WildR mice at 1 day and 14 days post-infection had a significantly lower bacterial burden than LabC mice, and this difference dissipated thereafter (Fig 1B left). In contrast, animals of both cohorts had a similar pathogen load in the spleen at individual time points (Fig 1B right). This suggests that the gut microbiota may shape innate immunity leading to different degrees of TB control in WildR mice and LabC mice in the early time points following infection. Dissemination of TB to secondary organs such as the spleen was not affected by the gut microbiota. Fig 1. WildR mice control acute pulmonary TB infection better than LabC mice. Open in a new tab BALB/c mice with conventional laboratory mouse gut microbiome (LabC) and BALB/c mice born to germ-free mothers reconstituted with wild-mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were infected with a low dose of aerosolized Mtb H37Rv. A. Study design and readouts. B. At designated time points, half of the organs of 6 mice per cohort were homogenized and plated on agar to determine the pathogen load in lungs (left panel) and spleen (right panel) over time.

Data of individual time points were analyzed using the two-sided Student’s t-test. *p<0.05, **p<0.001.TB infection affects the composition of the LabC and WildR gut microbiome The conventional BALB/c mouse model is widely used in TB research, including preclinical development of novel therapies. Laboratory mice have been bred under specific pathogen-free conditions for many generations which led to alteration of their gut microbiota, and consequently, changes in their immune responses relative to wild living mice [8]. It has been reported that TB infection has a profound impact on the gut microbiota of humans and mice [13, 14]. To investigate whether the gut microbiota impacts the course of TB in the BALB/c model, we used animals born to germ-free mothers that were inoculated with the gut microbiota of wild-living mice, and age-matched conventional BALB/c mice. Fecal samples obtained from individual mice of both cohorts prior to and during TB infection were subjected to DNA isolation and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. DADA2 denoising of paired-end reads identified an average of 102,631 (± 7,160) amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) per sample (S1 Table). Microbial community analysis of LabC and WildR gut microbiomes revealed that the two communities were similar in community richness prior to and during acute TB infection but were both reduced during chronic infection (Fig 2A). LabC and WildR communities significantly differed in microbial composition prior to and during TB infection suggesting that TB infection induced a dysbiosis of the gut microbiome regardless of the initial community structure (Fig 2B). In support of this, we assessed the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of samples collected during TB infection compared to pre-infection samples. Infection with TB significantly increased the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of microbial community relative to pre-infection samples within the first 14 days of infection and persisted through day 56 (Fig 2C). This TB-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been previously reported in both human and mouse TB infections (reviewed in [33]). Fig 2.

At the phylum level, Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes) and Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria) were dominant in WildR mice, whereas Bacillota (formerly Firmicutes) and Actinobacteriodota were enriched in the LabC mice. Verrucomicrobiota and Campylobacterota were only detected in LabC and WildR mice, respectively. Members of the Bacillota phylum including Ruminococcus (Family Ruminococcaceae), Butyricicoccus (Family Butyricicoccaceae), and multiple Lachnospiraceae groups were enriched in LabC mice. LabC mice also exhibited a higher proportion of Roseburia compared to WildR mice. Interestingly, Roseburia are butyrate-producing bacteria that are associated with beneficial health outcomes in mice and in humans [34]. WildR mice were enriched for Odoribacter (Family Marinifilaceae), Helicobacter (Family Helicobacteraceae), and genera within the Rikenellaceae family. The sulfur-reducing genera Bilophila and Desulfovibrio were also differentially abundant in WildR mice. A full list of differentially abundant taxa at the phylum, family, and genus levels is provided in S2 Table. Our findings in the BALB/c WildR model are consistent with the C57BL/6 WildR mice [4].LabC mice and WildR mice develop comparable pulmonary TB histopathology The gut microbiota of WildR mice was shown to promote host fitness and improve resistance to influenza infection [4]. To examine whether the microbiome impacts the lung histopathology of TB, we compared H&E-stained lung sections of LabC mice and WildR mice at 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection. Typical TB lung lesions in conventional BALB/c mice are cellular and consist of lymphocyte aggregates, epithelioid histocytes and intra-alveolar foamy macrophages [35–37]. At 14 days post-infection lymphocytes had accumulated in the lungs of LabC mice and WildR mice, mostly around larger airways (Fig 3A). At 28 days post-infection, unstructured cellular lesions were present, with a diameter often exceeding 0.5 mm that further increased until the end of the study at 56 days (Fig 3A). Foamy macrophages appearing more transparent due to their accumulation of lipid bodies filled out many alveolar spaces and were infected with acid-fast bacilli (Fig 3A, two right panels). The representation of TB lung pathology in both cohorts was very similar (Fig 3A, top and bottom row) and closely resembled reports in conventional BALB/c mice [35–37]. We then quantified the number of pulmonary immune cell infiltrates in H&E-stained sections. As expected, the number of TB lesions increased over the course of infection reaching 45 to 55 infiltrates per animal at the end of the study with no significant difference between the two cohorts (Fig 3B). We conclude that the wild mouse gut microbiome does not impact the number of lung lesions and the lesion organization in the BALB/c model. Fig 3. Pulmonary histopathology of TB is independent of the intestinal microbiome. Open in a new tab A. At 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection lungs of animals were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 3 μm, mounted on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin & eosin (eight panels on the left) or Ziehl-Neelsen (two panels on the right) and examined by brightfield microscopy. Acid-fast positive bacilli are shown as purple rods. Representative areas of LabC mice and WildR mice are shown. B. All lung lobes of two mice per cohort were completely sectioned with 50 μm steps between individual sections. Pulmonary infiltrates with a diameter of >100 μm were quantified. Infiltrates present in multiple sections were only counted once. Data are shown as mean and SD. The unpaired student’s t-test was used to perform pairwise comparisons at designated time points. Sections of all lung lobes at designated time points are shown in S2 Fig.WildR mice have a less pronounced T cell response during acute TB infection T cells play an essential role in controlling TB infection [38] and growing evidence suggest that T-cell responses can be shaped by the microbiota [39]. To determine the impact of the gut microbiota on T cell immunity to TB, we measured the dynamics of CD4, CD8 and γδ T cells during acute and chronic infection. WildR and LabC mice showed a robust expansion of pulmonary and splenic T cell subsets in response to TB infection (Fig 4A and 4B), which is consistent with the literature [40]. At 14 days post-infection, lungs of WildR mice had lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells than LabC mice and these differences faded to undetectable levels at later time points (Fig 4A). Similarly, WildR mice has slightly less γδ T-cells in the lungs at 28 days (Fig 4A). In the spleen, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts were on par throughout the experiment (Fig 4B). In addition, lungs of WildR mice had slightly more γδ T-cells than LabC mice at days 14 post-infection (Fig 4B). CD4 and CD8 T cells represented the majority of T-cell populations in WildR and LabC mice during infection (Fig 4C). WildR mice generally had a less pronounced T-cell response in the lungs at early time points, compared to LabC mice, and a comparable T-cell response in the spleen throughout the TB infections. Fig 4. WildR mice have a less pronounced T cell response in the lungs during acute TB infection. Open in a new tab At designated time points after Mtb infection, groups of four mice were used to prepare organ single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis of T cell subsets.

Unpaired Student’s t-tests were performed for pairwise analysis of T cell subsets of four LabC mice and four WildR mice at 14-, 28- and 56-days post-infection. *p<0.05, **p<0.001. E. Flow cytometry markers used in this study and definitions of analyzed T cell subsets.We also examined the protein levels of 23 cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and spleen of LabC and WildR mice at the acute and chronic phases of TB infection. Most cytokine and chemokine levels were much higher in the lungs than in the spleens (S1 Fig). We thus performed principal component analysis to explore if different gut microbiomes would affect cytokine expressions in response to TB infection (Fig 5). Cytokine profiles of mice from the same time points tend to cluster together regardless of their gut microbiome. This suggested that measured cytokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In summary, our data shows that the fecal microbiome impacts early T cell responses during acute infection which did not translate into changes in the cytokine profiles. Fig 5.

Concentrations of individual cytokines are shown in S1 Fig.Discussion The BALB/c mouse model has been a workhorse in TB preclinical therapy development for many decades, but results do not always align with humans. Mice having the gut microbiota of their wild-living relatives have better host fitness, improved disease resistance and might model humans more closely [4]. Here we tested whether introducing the wild mouse gut microbiota to the BALB/c host (WildR) would alter the representation and course of TB infection. Conventional BALB/c mice with the microbiome of continuously inbred animals (LabC) served as a reference. Consistent with previous reports, the compositions of the intestinal microbiomes of LabC and WildR mice had differently composed microbial gut communities (Fig 2D) [4]. The WildR mice were enrichen in Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota, whereas Bacillota and Actinobacteriodota were enriched in the LabC mice. Both LabC mice and WildR mice had microbiome taxa that are not common in specific pathogen free research environments and might be specific to our animal supplier’s facility. Helicobacter and Odoribacter were enriched in WildR mice. Colonization of the murine gut with Helicobacter hepaticus was associated with increased Mtb growth, elevated inflammation through CD4 and CD8 T cell activation [41] and more sever pulmonary pathology [42]. In contrast, Helicobacter pylori infection was associated with immunoprotection against TB in macaques and in humans [43]. The presence of Helicobacter species (H. bilis, H. ganmani, H. hepaticus, H. mastomyrinus, H. rodentium, H. typhlonius) that are part of the WildR gut microbiota [4] were beneficial or had no impact on TB infection in our studies. TB infection caused a major perturbation of the intestinal microbiome of both cohorts and induced a significant loss in community richness during the chronic infection stage (Fig 2A). Roseburia species, were more abundant in LabC mice than in WildR mice. The higher abundance of Roseburia might be beneficial for mice during chronic TB infections [34]. Our data is consistent with previous reports indicating significant differences in the relative abundance of members of the Lachospiraceae family in response to TB infection [15]. LabC mice showed the typical biphasic course of pulmonary TB infection, including the acute phase until day 28 followed by the chronic phase [32]. While in principle WildR mice phenocopied the pathogen kinetics of LabC mice, the number of bacilli detected in lungs was lower at 1- and 14-days post-infection (Fig 1B). The observed difference in lungs did not impact dissemination to the spleen (Fig 1C). Both cohorts share the same genetic background, were age-matched and were infected simultaneously in one infection chamber while maintaining strict separation between microbiomes. Therefore, a comparable Mtb dose was likely deposited in lungs of all study animals. The lower lung bacterial load we observed at 1- and 14-days in WildR cohort might indicate a better early innate immune control in these mice, which quickly faded at later study time points (Fig 1B). The axis of innate immunity and the microbiome is an area of ongoing research [44–46]. Germ-free mice for instance have a profoundly altered innate immune system and the gut is a signal hub that integrates environmental inputs to affect immunity and the response to infection [47]. The communication of the intestinal microbiota and innate immunity is bidirectional [48]. In line with this, we find that Mtb triggers gut microbiota dysbiosis, and in turn the wild mouse microbiome may have impacted the early events of TB infection when innate immune responses dominate. Growing evidence suggests that TB susceptibility is impacted by the microbial community in the gut (reviewed in [49]) and our results further support this key finding. The lower pathogen load in the lungs of WildR mice at 14 days post-infection did not translate into a measurable difference in pulmonary histopathology including the number of lesions and their organization and the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in our studies correlated with the organ bacterial load rather than the microbiome changes (Figs 3 and 4). The cytokine and chemokine profiles we measured in infected organs of LabC and WildR mice showed a large overlap (S1 Fig). A principal component analysis of data revealed a clear separation of animals by time points post-infection but not between microbiomes (Fig 5), demonstrating that cytokine and chemokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In a high-dose influenza A infection model using C57BL/6 mice, the wild mouse gut microbiota led to significant changes in cytokine profiles and was protective [4]. Such high-dose pathogen models typically assess immunity in a short time window after inoculation which was not the focus of our experiments. The nature of the infectious agent, the vastly different inoculation dose, the mouse strain and the choice of experimental endpoints may have contributed to the lack of cytokine profile changes in our studies. In summary, TB infection in BALB/c mice causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiome regardless of the initial community structure. WildR mice control initial acute infection (low pathogen burden) better, possibly through enhanced immunity. With the onset of chronic TB characterized by a high pathogen load however, this advantage fades over the course of infection. Further studies are required to elucidate how the intestinal microbiome shapes immunity in the BALB/c model.Supporting information S1 Fig. The cytokine profile measured in BALB/c mice having TB is independent of the gut microbiota.Organ homogenates obtained at designated time points were subjected to cytokine and chemokine quantification using the multiplex technology.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment.Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-015-0116-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: International Space Station, Air, Surface, Microbiome, Closed habitat, Cleanroom, Propidium monoazide",

    "methods": "Methods Sample characteristics Particulate materials were collected from the ISS HEPA filter element (ISS HEPA) and vacuum cleaner bag components (ISS Debris) used aboard the ISS as well as at two cleanrooms at JPL (one each originating from the SAF and building 103, Pasadena, CA), during this study. Table 1 lists sample characteristics, usage time of the material collection devices or system(s), model, make, and cleanroom conditions where the devices were used. The materials collected using the HEPA filter system represented the air and the vacuum cleaner bag represented the surface locations. ISS HEPA The environmental control system (ECS) aboard the ISS includes a distributed ventilation system that contains HEPA filter elements to remove suspended particulate matter from the cabin atmosphere and protect humidity control and air purification equipment from debris accumulation and biofouling [53]. Particle counts are not routinely measured aboard crewed spacecraft. A study conducted during space shuttle mission STS-32 (January 1990) found that the particle size distribution approximated a class 100,000 cleanroom for particles <2.5 μm, a class 400,000 cleanroom for particles 2.5 μm to <10 μm, and a class 3000 cleanroom for particles >10 μm [53, 54]. The particle size distributions are defined using cleanroom standard definitions (FED-STD-209 1992). The HEPA filters used aboard the ISS retain 99.97 % particles of 0.3 μm via a pleated borosilicate media. A 20-mesh (841-μm sieve openings) inlet screen located at the filter element’s face removes larger debris and fibers. The pleated, non-woven borosilicate HEPA filter media was installed by Flanders Filters, Inc. (Washington, NC) in the filter element housing. Flanders Filters, Inc.’s commercial “NaturalAire” cut-to-fit filtration media has the greatest similarity to the ISS HEPA filter media (http://flandersfilters.com/products/naturalaire/). Twenty-one filter elements are distributed throughout the ISS in several modules and astronauts replace them on a scheduled maintenance cycle ranging from 2.5 to 5 years, depending on the location. The part number of the HEPA filter system analyzed during this study was SV810010-1 and the serial number was 0049. The HEPA filter element analyzed during this study was manufactured in September 1998, installed in ISS on January 2008, and returned aboard space shuttle flight STS-134/ULF6 in late May 2011. This filter was installed in ISS Node 2 and was in service for 40 months, although the typical service time is only 30 months for this location. Typically, ground testing is performed to characterize a filter element’s pressure drop at various process air flow rates [53] after retrieval from the ISS, but in this case, the HEPA filter remained untouched in its shipment packaging from the time it was removed from the ISS until particulates were recovered at JPL for microbial characterization. The particulate materials collected from this sample were designated as ISS HEPA during this study. ISS debris The vacuum cleaner bag contained debris that had collected on the HEPA filter inlet screens. The vacuum cleaner bag components are representative of the collected debris (lint, food particles, skin/hair, and miscellaneous debris) that had been airborne in the cabin but had collected over time on the filter element inlet screen. The molecular microbial community analysis for the ISS vacuum bag debris (ISS Debris) was previously documented [14]. These results were utilized here for comparative purposes. The previous molecular characterizations of the ISS Debris sample were extended here with Illumina-based deep sequencing using archived DNA aliquots [14]. Sample characteristics of the ISS Debris are described in Table 1. Briefly, during the period of ISS Expeditions 30 and 31, reports by some crewmembers cited differences in the cabin environment compared to earlier experience as well as allergic responses to the cabin environment. One of the noted observations was a high level of visible dust in the ISS Node 3 cabin, to the extent it was sticking to the walls. Flight surgeons indicated that this had been reported not just in Node 3 but also throughout the US on-orbit segment and expressed a concern for crew health. Dust on the ISS is expected, with humans being major contributors (via skin shedding, eating, exercising, etc.). Other sources such as on-orbit maintenance activities can release dust from sources such as payloads and systems, clothing, and visiting vehicles. As a precautionary measure, in the middle of 2012, an investigation was launched to define and mitigate dust sources and to determine if exposure to dust might elicit an adverse effect on crew health. As a result of these crewmember reports, particulate and fiber debris samples were collected during ISS Expedition 31 using a handheld portable vacuum cleaner and returned to Earth aboard Soyuz flight 29S in early July 2012 for analyses. Details of the novel “Prime” vacuum cleaner developed for NASA habitats were reported elsewhere [55]. Portions of the samples were aseptically collected for microbiological testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC), with the remaining bag and its contents repacked in a biological hood, sealed, and shipped to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for particle size testing, as well as to JPL to determine their molecular microbiological composition. The vacuum cleaner bag was shipped via FedEx at room temperature with instructions that the samples not be irradiated in transport. Earth analogs For comparison, particles collected from two JPL cleanroom floors using a Nilfisk GM80CR vacuum cleaner (the disposable bag part number is 81620000; Morgantown, PA) were analyzed (Table 1). Cleanroom certification is based on the maximum number of particles greater than 0.5 μm per cubic foot of air. The air within Class 1 K cleanrooms is maintained at fewer than 1000 particulates per cubic foot, Class 10 K cleanrooms are allowed to harbor a density of 10,000 particles per cubic foot, and so on. The cleanroom samples were from (a) the JPL-SAF cleanroom floor where various Mars mission spacecraft were built (Class 10 K; JPL-SAF Debris) and (b) JPL building 103 where non-mission critical activities were conducted (Class 1 K; JPL-103 Debris). The vacuum cleaner bag debris from the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 buildings was transported to the microbiology laboratories for storage. Sample processing was carried out immediately after aseptic collection of the materials, usually within 7 days from the retrieval of the vacuum bags from the cleanrooms. Both Earth-analog samples were processed at the same time as the ISS Debris samples. However, the ISS HEPA sample was received ~3 months later and hence was analyzed separately. Sample processing All samples were subjected to a variety of microbiological and molecular techniques to elucidate composition of cultivable, viable, and total microorganisms. Independent of the samples taken to cultivate bacterial and fungal analyses, subsamples of the same samples were taken for DNA extraction. Weighing vacuum debris samples was possible, whereas the HEPA filter elements were divided into small pieces and particulates associated with the pieces were aseptically collected using sterile scalpels before being quantitatively measured. Approximately 1 g of each vacuum debris and HEPA filter associated particle was weighed and placed into a sterile tube containing 25 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortexed for 1 min. After vigorous mixing, large particles were allowed to settle, and aliquots of samples were carefully siphoned and allocated for culture-based (1 mL) and culture-independent analyses (15 mL). Traditional culture-based microbial examination For estimating bacterial populations, after suitable serial tenfold dilution in sterile PBS, 100 μL of the sample suspension was spread onto two plates of R2A media (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25 °C for 2–7 days. For the fungal population enumeration, 100 μL was spread onto two plates of potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25 °C for 2–7 days. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted and reported as CFU/g of material. Identifications and phylogenetic affiliations were carried out via sequencing for both bacteria and fungi by targeting the 16S rRNA gene [42] and the ITS region [56], respectively. When identifications were ambiguous, sequencing of an additional gene (gyrB) was performed to confirm the phylogenetic identity of the purified bacterial isolates [57, 58]. The nucleotide sequences of bacteria (KT763339–KT763368) and fungi (KT832780-KT832790) were deposited in GenBank. Sample processing for molecular analysis The biological materials associated with each sample (15 mL) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of microbial cells, spores, and exogenous nucleic acid fragments greater than 100 bp in a final volume of 2.5 mL. All filtered samples were then divided into three separate aliquots: the first aliquot (1000 μL) was subjected to PMA pretreatment (viability assessment), the second (1000 μL) was an untreated environmental sample (viable + nonviable; total DNA), and the third (500 μL) was used for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis (see below). For measuring viable microbial population, one aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension (1000 μL) was treated with 12.5 μL of PMA (2 mM; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA) to a final concentration of 25 μM [26, 32], followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 5 min at room temperature [15]. The sample was exposed to PhAST blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L., Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min (in parallel with the non-PMA-treated sample). This step enabled blocking DNA from dead cells [15]. The samples were then split in half and one half was subjected to bead beating with the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) with parameters set at 5 m/s for 60 s. The second half of the unprocessed sample was then combined with the mechanically disrupted counterpart before DNA was extracted via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions [59]. Resulting DNA suspensions (100 μL each) were stored at −20 °C. Quantitation of total and viable microorganisms using molecular methods ATP assay A bioluminescence assay was performed to determine the total ATP and intracellular ATP from all samples using the CheckLite HS kit (Kikkoman Corp., Noda, Japan), as described previously [60]. Briefly, to determine the total ATP (dead and viable microbes), 100-μL sample aliquots (four replicates) were each combined with 100 μL of a cell lysing detergent (benzalkonium chloride) then incubated at room temperature for 1 min prior to the addition of 100 μL of a luciferin-luciferase reagent. The sample was mixed, and the resulting bioluminescence was measured with a luminometer, the Lumitester K-210 (Kikkoman Corp.). To determine intracellular ATP (viable microbes), 50 μL of an ATP-eliminating reagent (apyrase, adenosine deaminase) was added to a 500-μL portion of the sample and allowed to incubate for 30 min to remove any extracellular ATP, after which the assay for ATP was carried out, as described above, in four replicates, including sterile PBS as negative controls. As previously established, one RLU, the unit of measurement of ATP, was assumed to be approximately equal to one CFU [42].qPCR assay Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, targeting the 16S rRNA gene, was performed in triplicate with a CFX-96 thermal cycling Instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to quantify the bacterial burden. Bacteria-directed primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene 1369 F (5′-CGG TGA ATACGT TCY CGG-3′) and modified 1492R (5′-GGW TAC CTTGTT ACG ACT T-3′) were used for this analysis [61]. Each 25-μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), and 1 μL of template DNA. Purified DNA from B. pumilus cells served as the positive control and DNase/RNase-free molecular-grade distilled water (UltraPure, Gibco) was used as the negative control. These controls were included in all qPCR runs. Reaction conditions were as follows: a 3-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and a combined annealing and extension at 55 °C for 35 s. Molecular microbial diversity analysis using next-generation sequencing methods Pyrosequencing conditions Bacterial primers 28 F (5′-GAG TTT GAT CNT GGC TCA G-3′) and 519R (5′-GTN TTA CNG CGG CKG CTG-3′) were used to amplify ~500-bp fragments spanning the V1–V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Archaeal primers 341 F (5′-GYG CAS CAG KCG MGA AW-3′) and 958R (5′-GGA CTA CVS GGG TAT CTA AT-3′) were used to amplify ~600-bp fragments spanning the V3–V5 hypervariable regions of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene. A fungal primer set ITS1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) and ITS4R (5′-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3′) was employed to amplify ~600-bp fragments of the fungal ITS region. These primer pairs were tailored for pyrosequencing by adding a fusion linker and a proprietary 8-nt barcode sequence at the 5′ end of the forward primer and a biotin and fusion linker sequence at the 5′ end of the reverse primer [62]. A HotStarTaq Plus master mix kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to catalyze the PCR under the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, finalized by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. Resulting PCR products were purified via Diffinity Rapid Tip (Diffinity Genomics, Inc., West Henrietta, NY) chemistry and were then pooled accordingly. Small fragments were removed with Agencourt Ampure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). In preparation for FLX-Titanium sequencing (Roche, Nutley, NJ), resulting PCR amplicon fragment size and concentration were accurately measured with DNA 1000 chips using a Bioanalyzer 2100 automated electrophoresis station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a TBS-380 Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μL for strong positives (>10 ng/μL), 5 μL for weak positives (5 to 10 ng/μL), and 20 μL for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng/μL). This normalization step helped to ensure minimal bias favoring downstream amplification from initially strong PCR products. Approximately 9.6 × 106 molecules of ~600-bp double-stranded DNA were combined with 9.6 × 106 DNA capture beads and then subjected to emulsion PCR conditions. Following recovery and enrichment, bead-attached DNA molecules were denatured with NaOH and sequencing primers were annealed. A four-region 454 pyrosequencing run was performed on a GS PicoTiterPlate (PTP) using the Genome Sequencer FLX System, in accordance with manufacturer instructions (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Twenty-four to 30 tagged samples were applied to each quarter region of the PTP. All pyrosequencing procedures were performed at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX) in accordance with well-established protocols [62].Illumina sequencing conditions The library preparations for next-generation sequencing and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and DNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis (0.8 % agarose gel). The sequencing library was constructed using a MetaVx™ Library Preparation kit (GENEWIZ, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). In brief, 5–50 ng of DNA was used for amplicon generation to cover the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA. Indexed and universal adapters were added to the ends of the 16S rDNA amplicons by limited-cycle PCR. The DNA libraries were validated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and quantified using Qubit and real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA libraries were multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq following the instructions from the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) configuration was used for sequencing. The image analysis and base calling were processed using MiSeq Control Software. The initial taxonomy was performed on Illumina’s BaseSpace cloud computing platform.Bioinformatic analyses of bacterial pyrosequences High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing data were processed. Bacterial and archaeal sequences were processed and analyzed using the mothur software [16, 63]. Sequences were quality filtered by removing sequences that (a) did not contain the primer sequence, (b) contained an uncorrectable barcode, (c) were <250 nt in length, (d) had homopolymers longer than 8 nt, or (e) had a quality score of <25; and then demultiplexed using the respective sample nucleotide barcodes. These sequences were searched against the Greengenes reference database [64, 65] and clustered into OTUs based on their sequence similarity (97 %) with UCLUST [66]. A representative sequence was picked from each OTU and taxonomic classification was assigned using mothur’s Bayesian classifier [67] and Greengenes training sequences and taxonomy [64, 65].Bioinformatic analyses of fungal pyrosequences The sequences were run through ITSx 1.0.9 [68] to remove non-ITS sequences, assembly chimeras, and sequences for which none of the 3′ end of SSU rDNA or the 5′ end of 5.8S rDNA was detected. The ITS1 sub-region was extracted from the remaining sequences for further analyses. Chimera control was exercised through UCHIME 7 [69] using the UNITE chimera reference dataset [70] as reference corpus. The sequences were subjected to clustering and taxonomic assignment in the Sequence Clustering and Analysis of Tagged Amplicons (SCATA) next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline (http://scata.mykopat.slu.se) using the February 2014 release of UNITE as taxonomic reference corpus. The default sequence quality control settings of SCATA were used; however, the clustering threshold was set to 98.5 % [71]. All taxonomic affiliations proposed by SCATA were examined manually using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) 2.2.30 [72] in GenBank [73] and UNITE [74] and occasionally refined using the principles outlined in Koljalg et al. [75] and Nilsson et al. [76].Preprocessing of bacterial Illumina sequences The 12 sets of 16S rDNA V3 amplicon data were sequenced at GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ,), where the obtained reads were trimmed to remove primer sequences. The raw sequence dataset was composed of 10,241,173 paired-end reads, 150 bp in length, with exceptionally high quality (<0.1 % error rate) (Resphera DiscoveryTM protocol, Baltimore, MD). After trimming noisy reads and removal of low-quality and chimeric sequences, we identified a moderate level of expected contaminants, including chloroplast and mammalian mitochondrial sequence (range 0.0001–9.3 %), as well as a low level of unknown contaminants (range 0.01–1.8 %). Exploratory characterization of unknown contaminant representatives indicated nonspecific amplification mitochondrial sequences from various eukaryotic organisms. After completion of preprocessing, the resulting high-quality R1 and R2 read sets contained 9.1 M and 9.3 M sequences, respectively, with an average length of 128 bp. Due to the primer set and sequencing technology selected by the vendor, we were unable to merge paired-end sequences into longer consensus fragments as they did not overlap. Therefore, in this analysis, we compared our findings between the R1 (forward)- and R2 (reverse)-associated datasets to evaluate consistency. Across R1 and R2 datasets, each sample had on average 917,060 clean sequences. After clustering sequences into OTUs, OTU tables were rarefied to an even coverage of 525,000 sequences per sample. On average, Good’s coverage statistic for rarefied samples was 99.78 %, indicating we have observed the vast majority of OTU diversity in each community.Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial Illumina sequences Sequences were de-multiplexed using 5′ barcode identifiers and analyzed using the Resphera Discovery™ protocol (Baltimore, MD). Briefly, 16S rRNA sequence fragments were first screened in Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [77] for quality and length requiring: (a) trimming at the first 5-bp run of Phred quality scores below 20, (b) one ambiguous base call or less, and (c) a minimum final length of 125 bp after trimming of forward and reverse primer sequences. Passing sequences were screened for PhiX-174 spiked fragments and PCR-associated chimeras by UCHIME [69] (de novo mode). Non-chimeric reads were then filtered for contaminant chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences using the RDP classifier [17], followed by a broad nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN) [78] search of the GreenGenes 16S rRNA reference database [65] (v1.1) to identify potential unknown contaminants. The resulting high-quality dataset was clustered into de novo OTUs using UCLUST [66] with a 95 % identity threshold. OTU representatives were assigned to a taxonomic lineage using the RDP classifier trained on the Resphera 16S rRNA database (v1.1) requiring a minimum confidence score of 0.50.Statistical analyses To perform pairwise statistical comparisons of sample groups of interest, a negative binomial test implemented in DESeq [79] or Fisher’s exact test was utilized and controlled for false positives using the false discovery rate (FDR) [80]. For the comparison of bacterial pyrosequence and Illumina data and fungal pyrosequence analysis, multivariate statistical analyses of community profiles were performed using an “in-house R-script” employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac [81]. First, each dataset composed of OTU abundances per sample was rarefied to the lowest number of reads and a Bray-Curtis index was calculated. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times and the average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated for each dataset in order to avoid biases arising from rarefication. The Bray-Curtis distance was then utilized to calculate principal coordinate (PCoA) analyses, PERMANOVA (1000 permutations), and MRPP (1000 permutations).",
    "results": "Results Microbial burden The samples analyzed during this study were the following: ISS HEPA filter particulates, vacuum cleaner bag components of ISS (ISS Debris), JPL Class 10 K cleanroom (JPL-SAF Debris), and JPL Class 1 K cleanroom (JPL-103 Debris) (Table 1). Microbial burdens estimated via traditional cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods are given in Table 2. The bacteria capable of growth in nutrient-rich media were in the range of 105 CFU per gram in the ISS HEPA filter sample and an order of magnitude greater (106 CFU per gram) for the ISS Debris. Relatively, the bacterial populations were larger in the ISS Debris sample than in the JPL cleanroom debris samples. When compared to the ISS Debris, the JPL-SAF Debris harbored an order of magnitude smaller bacterial population (105 CFU per gram) and the JPL-103 Debris sample was two orders of magnitude fewer (1.4 × 104 CFU per gram). In general, cultivable fungi were less represented than bacteria in all samples tested. The cultivable fungal population was two logs less for the ISS samples when compared to their bacterial counts, whereas the JPL cleanroom samples exhibited one-log difference. The ISS Debris possessed a similar fungal burden as that of the JPL-SAF Debris sample, which is higher than the more stringent JPL-103 area. The ISS HEPA harbored less fungi when compared to the ISS Debris. Table 1.

This trend was not noticed in the samples that were treated with PMA (viable bacterial population), where ~107 16S rRNA gene copies per gram accounted for all samples except in the JPL-SAF, which exhibited ~108 16S rRNA gene copies. The percentage of the viable bacterial population (PMA-treated samples) was ~1.7 % in the ISS HEPA, ~2.7 % in ISS Debris, and ~4.5 % in the JPL-103 samples. However, approximately 67 % of the bacteria in the JPL-SAF Debris were viable. The total ATP contents derived from both dead and alive cells were in the range of 107 relative light unit (RLU) per gram, except for the sample collected from the Class 1 K JPL-103 cleanroom, which showed ~2.6 × 106 RLU per gram. The microbial estimation carried out via an intracellular ATP assay (viable cells only) indicated that only 1.7 % of the total microorganisms were viable in the ISS HEPA sample. In the case of the ISS Debris sample, this percentage was much higher (75 %); similarly, JPL-SAF and JPL-103 constituted approximately 11 % and 46 % viable microorganisms, respectively. Culture-based microbial diversity The 16S rRNA sequencing-based identification and phylogenetic affiliation of the bacterial and fungal strains isolated during this study are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. Among 41 bacterial strains isolated and identified, 36 belonged to 29 different species, five strains were only identified to the genus level. The majority of the identified isolates belong to Firmicutes and only four strains were affiliated to the members of the Proteobacteria group. The highest number of isolates was represented by Bacillus and Staphylococcus genera. While Bacillus was dominant in both ISS samples, Staphylococcus was only present in ISS Debris. Both genera were either absent or underrepresented in the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 samples. Single representatives of other spore-forming lineages were also identified (Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, and Solibacillus). Notably, five strains belonging to the B. anthracis-cereus-thuringiensis group were isolated from the HEPA filter, and more detailed phylogenetic, pathogenic, and whole genome sequence characterizations are underway to confirm the functional characteristics of these isolates. The pathogenic properties specific to B. anthracis were not present in these five strains (data not shown). Among 19 fungal strains sequenced, 13 strains were identified to six different species. Out of 19 fungal strains, 16 were isolated from the ISS samples and the other three strains were from JPL samples. All the cultivated fungal strains affiliated phylogenetically to the members of the Ascomycota phylum. The most common fungal isolate in the ISS samples was Aspergillus niger, although other diverse species of Aspergillus were also identified, along with Penicillium as the second most dominant genus (Additional file 1: Table S1). Based on these results, most of the cultivated bacteria or fungi from the ISS locations were not noticed in the Earth-analog cleanrooms. Pyrosequencing-derived bacterial diversity The number of pyrosequences belonging to various bacterial phyla and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is presented in Additional file 1: Table S2. Approximately, 100,000 reads of bacterial pyrosequences of >500 bp in length were generated from eight samples during this study. When the software mothur [16] was employed for the bioinformatics analysis, ~71 % of the sequences were deemed to be of good quality and used for further analysis, resulting in 70,669 sequences (Additional file 1: Table S2). Among PMA-untreated samples, the ISS Debris yielded the highest number of sequences (30,111 reads) whereas the lowest number of sequences was seen in the ISS HEPA (1,720). Likewise, more sequences were retrieved from the JPL-SAF (8,482 reads) as compared with the JPL-103 (5,062) sample. Contrary to the pyrosequence abundance, higher numbers of OTUs were present in the JPL-SAF sample (1,448 OTUs) than in the ISS Debris (452 OTUs) sample. However, as noticed in the pyrosequence abundance, the number of OTUs was also higher in the JPL-103 sample (301 OTUs) as compared to the ISS HEPA (133 OTUs) sample. The PMA-untreated samples constituted ~65 % of the high-quality sequences, while only 35 % of the sequences were retrieved from PMA-treated samples (25,294 sequences). Among the PMA-treated (viable) portions, ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples possessed ~38 % and 60 % of sequences, respectively. Similar to the ISS Debris sample, a higher percent of viable sequences was retrieved from the JPL-SAF Debris (77 %) but surprisingly, only ~3 % of the viable sequences were from the PMA-treated JPL-103 Debris sample. Almost all of the viable bacterial pyrosequences retrieved from the ISS HEPA filter were members of Corynebacterium. This organism was also dominant in the ISS Debris sample (Additional file 1: Table S2). Genera such as Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus were only present in the ISS Debris sample. While the ISS-HEPA sample contained fewer sequence reads representing only five genera, the ISS Debris sample was dominated by low abundance of more diverse genera (Stenotrophomonas, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Delftia). Bacillus species were predominant when traditional cultivation methods were employed (Additional file 1: Table S1), but Bacillus pyrosequences were not retrieved. When PMA-treated samples from the ISS samples were compared to the Earth-analog cleanroom samples, the dominant phyla were found to be very similar (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes). However, on the genus level, the JPL-SAF yielded many more viable sequences representing diverse genera (data not shown). Illumina-derived bacterial diversity The Illumina sequencing generated ~6.8 million high-quality reads, which is ~100 times more coverage than was obtained with pyrosequencing yield Additional file 2: Figure S1. Since Illumina sequences were short (~150 bp each), it was not possible to reliably resolve taxonomic affiliation beyond the genus level. We characterized high-quality reads using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier [17] and summarized community composition at multiple taxonomic levels. Among the ISS-associated samples, profiles were dominated by Actinobacteria, Bacilli, and Clostridia, while samples from the JPL-associated sites maintained higher levels of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 1). At the family level, the differences between ISS and JPL profiles were substantial, with complete distinction between the two sites using actinobacterial members alone—the ISS samples were dominated by Corynebacterium, while the actinobacterial groups among JPL samples were predominantly Geodermatophilaceae. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Taxonomic profiles of R1 samples at the class levelActinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla together constituted 80 % or more in all cases. When compared on the family level, sequences associated with any family did not exceed more than 10 % of the total sequences. Characteristics of bacterial phyla that are dominant during this study are depicted in Table 3. A clear-cut trend was noticed on the presence of bacterial phylum dominance on the ISS as well as in the Earth-analog cleanroom samples. Viable sequences arising from Actinobacteria were the most abundant in the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples (~95 and ~66 %, respectively), while Proteobacteria was present in the least numbers (0.41 and ~3 %, respectively). Among these three dominant phyla, the lowest percentage was found for Firmicutes and differed significantly between cleanroom samples as well (JPL-SAF: 11.05 % and JPL-103: 0.98 %). In-depth analysis showed that the ISS HEPA sample accumulated more sequences of the genus Corynebacterium than ISS Debris sample. In addition to the latter, the ISS Debris had sequences associated with the order Actinomycetales and the genus Staphylococcus. In contrast, the JPL-SAF Debris sample possessed larger numbers of Bacillus and unclassified Proteobacteria genera sequences, whereas JPL-103 Debris mimicked ISS locations and members of Actinobacteria were more dominant.

Hierarchical clustering of samples using genus taxonomic profiles resulted in clustering of samples by collection site but not strong clustering of paired PMA or no PMA samples (Fig. 2). Both the negative binomial test and Fisher’s exact test provided valuable information and supported the hierarchical clustering scenario. Searching for differentially abundant genus-level groups with significant P values using the negative binomial test, we saw that the vast majority of differentially abundant taxa were relatively depleted in the PMA-treated group. The only well-represented genera that were relatively enriched were Clostridium (0.34 % vs. 2.46 %, P = 0.009) and Rheinheimera (0.005 % vs. 0.472 %, P = 7E-06). In contrast, genera such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Neisseria were all relatively enriched in the untreated samples. Alpha diversity estimators also indicated a significant drop in diversity associated with PMA treatment. On average, PMA samples had 48 % fewer OTUs than their untreated pairs (paired T-test P = 0.004). This consistent reduction in the PMA samples was also true for Faith’s diversity, Chao1, and Shannon diversity measures (Fig. 3) and is consistent with the depletion of many taxa identified by differential abundance analysis. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering of samples using taxonomic profiles at the genus level (R1 dataset). The taxonomic profiles clustered based on sampling location. The color scale reflects log-normalized proportional values (e.g. −1 ~ 10 %, −2 ~ 1 %, −3 ~ 0.1 %). JPL-SAF samples clustering together and showing several unique low abundance members were not found in the JPL-103 Debris and ISS samples (e.g., Mollicutes, Nitrospira, and members of Chloroflexi). Rows and columns are clustered independently using the furthest neighbor algorithm with a Euclidean distance metric. o order, f family, g genusFig. 3. Open in a new tab PMA treatment is associated with a reduction in alpha diversity. Alpha diversity values are normalized as a percentage of their mean value across all eight samples in the chartTo better characterize the shared community composition among samples, beta-diversity metrics (e.g., Bray-Curtis distances) were computed and evaluated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Figure 4 displays PCoA plots associated with the R1 dataset. The samples from the same site are highly similar in composition regardless of PMA treatment. Using Procrustes analysis, we compared PCoA plots generated for both the R1 and R2 datasets. In this case, Procrustes analysis was employed to transform the R2-based principal coordinate set (by rotation, scaling, and translation) to minimize the distances between corresponding points in the R1 principal coordinate space. We found that virtually identical distances were derived between the R1 and R2 PCoA plots, further supporting the clustering of PMA and untreated paired samples. This high-resolution comparison stood in contrast to broader composition comparisons, such as the hierarchical clustering above. At the OTU level, the bacterial composition was strongly associated with the sampling site, and the reduced overall diversity of PMA treatment did not dramatically impact the composition relative to sample origin. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analysis plot (R1 data) based on Bray-Curtis distances. Percentage of variance explained by each principal coordinate axis is shown in parentheses Pyrosequencing-derived archaeal diversity When the samples were subjected to the archaeal characterization, neither qPCR nor PCR for next-generation sequencing generated archaeal amplification products (data not shown). It is likely that the presence of archaea in these samples was at a very low concentration (<100 gene copies per PCR reaction), below the detection limits of the technology [14]. Alternatively, materials associated with the dust samples might have inhibited the archaeal DNA amplification. However, this is unlikely because the dust samples spiked with a purified archaeal DNA did exhibit an appropriate band after PCR amplification (data not shown). Pyrosequencing-derived fungal diversity In total, ~35,000 fungal pyrosequences were retrieved from the eight samples. The detailed breakdown of the number of sequences and OTUs is given in Table 4. The comparison is made on the class level, as fungal taxonomy is not as well described on the genus level as bacterial taxonomy when it comes to sequencing of environmental substrates. The fungal OTUs represented 153 distinct taxa. Most OTUs were obtained for three classes: Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Tremellomycetes. As noticed for the bacterial abundance, fungal species richness was also location specific. The dry cleanroom surfaces were found to harbor different fungal species (mostly Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes) whereas ISS samples possessed more Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Exobasidiomycetes members.

In contrast, viable fungal sequences for Dothideomycetes and Tremellomycetes were common in the ISS Debris samples. Viable fungal diversity was far higher in the JPL-SAF Debris sample than in JPL-103 Debris. The JPL-SAF Debris sample revealed the highest diversity that are viable and the highest number of sequences. The great number of Eurotiomycetes sequences was confirmed by cultivation of Aspergillus and Penicillium isolates from the ISS HEPA and ISS debris. Significant differences of microbial communities between ISS and Earth cleanroom samples The differences between the ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiomes were assessed using multivariate statistics. Independent analyses of bacterial sequences derived from pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing revealed a significant difference in the community profile of ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiomes. These differences are displayed in ordination analyses (Additional file 3: Figure S2) and are supported by Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analyses (Additional file 1: Table S4). Irrespective of the sample origin, the viable community profile was highly similar to the total community profile, revealing no significant differences in PERMANOVA or MRPP indices. However, the differences between the viable and total community profile were outweighed by the substantial differences of the ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiome, which ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 concerning the chance-corrected within-group agreement (Additional file 1: Table S4). Bacterial and fungal taxa that showed a significant difference between ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom samples are presented in Additional file 3: Figure S2.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The safety and health of spaceflight crewmembers are of the highest importance for current and future missions. Individuals living and/or working in built environments are often susceptible to health issues associated with microorganisms [18, 19]. Moreover, the microbial ecology of ISS remains largely unknown, as study efforts have been mostly focused on microbiological surveillance using cultivation procedures. The NRC recommended use of state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques to develop better microbial monitoring of future closed habitat(s) and response system(s) against potential biohazards originating from microbiological sources, using the ISS as a test bed [1, 4]. Exploration of the microbial diversity associated with unusual built-in environments such as the ISS would further contribute to the indoor microbiome research. This will benefit the development of spaceflight applications as well as basic and applied research on Earth. The main goal of this study was to determine ISS air and surface viable microbiomes and unveil the differences of viable microbiomes on the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The ISS is a very unique environment due to microgravity, and a suitable Earth analog of this ecosystem is not available. The cleanrooms used for comparison in this study are environmentally controlled and represent oligotrophic conditions in an Earth-based setting. Comprehensive characterization and cataloguing of microbial species in NASA cleanrooms has been taking place since the 1970s. This extensive data set renders these facilities the best-characterized closed environments with limited human traffic that the ISS samples can be compared with [20–24]. A lower incidence of cultivable microorganisms in Earth cleanrooms than ISS surfaces suggests that regular thorough maintenance and cleaning practices are required to reduce microbial burden in closed habitats. Multiple studies have used PMA for the estimation of viable bioburden, but they were mostly interpreted by qPCR [25–27], next-generation sequencing [15, 28, 29], or PhyloChipG3 [15]. The utilization of PMA combined with Illumina MiSeq technology for exploring viable microbiome of ISS-related environmental surfaces is not yet reported. The NGS technology resulting in information on millions of base pairs might have included genetic information from dead cells including contaminant DNA associated with the sample processing reagents [30, 31]. Thus, PMA treatment would eliminate these contaminants, making it possible to elucidate viable microbiomes. However, it was documented that PMA might not work for all kinds of microbial populations, especially spores where the dye was not able to penetrate the dead but intact spores [32]. Despite this, none of the other current methodologies can precisely estimate viable populations; PMA treatment has the highest potential to lead to the substantial differentiation between dead and live cells [15]. The statistical analysis of the viable bacterial community in this study revealed the significant variance in viable microbiome (Fig. 4; Additional file 1: Table S3 and S4), between the ISS and the cleanroom samples. The ISS HEPA filter was in service for ~40 months whereas debris collected from the ISS surface was only 1 day old (Table 1). The HEPA filter system employed in ISS was designed to revitalize the air by passing through a heat-exchange process. Hence, particulates associated with ISS HEPA filter might have been exposed to drier conditions than the crew living quarter debris (relative humidity >50 %) and therefore the microorganisms that could withstand dry conditions only survived in the HEPA filter. Any microbial species that could withstand a prolonged period of time (~40 months during this study) requires survival capabilities against harsh conditions, and members of the Actinobacteria phylum are known to withstand desiccation, dry conditions, and high pH [33, 34], which explains their abundance in ISS HEPA filters (~95.28 %; Table 3). Comparatively, sequences of viable Actinobacteria were retrieved in more numbers in ISS surface debris (~66 %) than in Earth cleanroom debris (~25 %) samples. The members of Actinobacteria phylum represent human skin commensals and also soil-borne microorganisms [35]. The dominance of Actinobacteria might be due to the presence of astronauts who live and perform work activities on board the ISS. However, characterization of astronauts’ skin microbiome is warranted and such studies will add more insights into the source of these bacteria associated with the ISS environmental surfaces and atmosphere. Actinobacteria have been previously reported in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and these non-spore-forming bacteria were considered a potential contamination risk of spacecraft due to their resistance to desiccation and ultraviolet radiation [34]. In this study, the viable population of the Actinobacteria did not constitute high population of the Earth cleanrooms, although this can be explained by the different gowning procedures required before entering these facilities unlike practiced in the ISS. In this study, both the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples contained high number of viable Corynebacterium sequences whereas Propionibacterium sequences were more in the ISS Debris sample. Since these microorganisms require special growth conditions, they were not isolated when traditional cultivation methods were employed during this study. Although the Propionibacterium species represent natural skin commensals, P. acnes is considered an opportunistic pathogen that leads to various infections [36, 37]. Similar concerns refer to Corynebacterium, which has received attention for being a genus containing several opportunistic pathogens [38]. Even though viable sequences of these opportunistic pathogens were retrieved from both ISS locations, their virulence characteristics are to be studied before correlating their influence on human health in a closed habitat. The risk of acquiring infection from opportunistic bacterial and fungal pathogens might pose a threat to crewmembers’ health and needs to be studied in the future. In contrast, both of the Earth-based cleanrooms contained more Proteobacterial members when compared to the ISS locations. This trend has previously been seen in the studies of cleanroom-associated microbiomes when Sanger sequencing or DNA microarray method(s) were attempted, where human-associated Proteobacteria constituted the dominating phylum [11, 15, 39]. Low abundance (<100 sequences) of Gammaproteobacteria, human commensals, in ISS samples appears reasonable since at any given time only a maximum of six astronauts are present [40]. Despite more human traffic in Earth cleanrooms, lower abundance of Gammaproteobacterial members were noticed. This might be due to the fact that appropriate countermeasures (cleaning) were in place to prevent contamination in these indoor facilities. The high abundance of Acinetobacter and Brevundimonas in the ISS Debris sample showed that these microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and associated with the debris [41] suggesting that their presence cannot be avoided. The members of the oligotrophic class Sphingomonodaceae were more abundant in the JPL-SAF sample and were previously found to persist in these nutrient-deprived environments [42]. Among the Firmicutes, species belonging to the genus Staphylococcus were common on the ISS surfaces but not present in the ISS air. This indicates that co-inhabiting astronauts might have shed more skin microorganisms that were captured by the vacuum cleaner than the HEPA system. The cultivation-dependent method confirmed the presence of several Staphylococcus species in the ISS surface samples and these species were not isolated from other samples investigated during this study. In contrast, the higher abundance of viable Bacillus species in the JPL-SAF (Class 10 K) sample suggests that they might have originated from the surrounding soil [43]. Lower abundance of Bacillus species in the more stringent JPL-103 cleanroom (Class 1 K) further reiterated that appropriate maintenance could regulate microbial presence in a much cleaner indoor environment [42]. The dominant cultivable isolates of bacteria from both ISS air and ISS surfaces were spore-forming Bacillus. As members of this genus are common inhabitants of soil and dust, they were highly probable to be cultured from the ISS samples on a nutrient-rich media. When the phylogenetic affiliation results for the cultivable strains were compared to the NGS results, only Illumina-derived deep sequencing yielded Bacillus sequences. In our previous efforts, Bacillus eluded detection when traditional Sanger sequencing [44], PhyloChip G2 technology [45], or 454-pyrosequencing analysis of amplicons were employed [11]. Likewise, in this study, the pyrosequencing method again did not retrieve sequences of spore formers. In contrast, the Illumina method frequently yielded the sequences indicative of the spore formers, including members of the genus Bacillus and Paenibacillus. The absence of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus sequences might be either attributed to the specificity of the iTag primer sets or the efficiency of the DNA extraction method employed. However, the Promega Maxwell-16 DNA extraction system used in this study was successful in extracting nucleic acids from the pure cultures of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus. Despite the same sample preparation, the Illumina-based sequencing generated more reads (40–2400 times; average ~100 times), thus providing a deeper coverage of microbial diversity than the 454 platform. Choosing an appropriate technology is important when abundance and richness of the microbial diversity are considered. Although Illumina can be employed to understand yet-to-be cultivated microorganisms, the use of well-established traditional techniques should not be completely abandoned. Fungal strains have been detected on the ISS multiple times as actively growing molds on the environmental surfaces or responsible microorganisms deteriorating the components of ISS hardware [4]. The abundance of the fungal molds in indoor environments was reported to be associated with invasive infections and allergies [46, 47]. Therefore, a high number of fungal isolates from the ISS locations confirmed a need for continuous monitoring of the ISS for fungal populations. Aspergillus niger was the predominant isolate, and although it does not have the potential to cause disease at the same rate as other Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, A. flavus), it was correlated with pulmonary and ear infections [48]. Aspergillus species are repeatedly isolated in indoor microbiomes [49]. The detection of multiple isolates of A. niger is consistent with its frequent presence in built environments including ISS surfaces [50]. However, its survival capability, proliferation, and molecular alteration in response to ISS microgravity conditions need to be studied further. On the other hand, A. niger is known for production of many beneficial substances. The potential for production of novel beneficial secondary metabolites under microgravity conditions needs to be explored for use in diverse biotechnological and pharmaceutical fields [51, 52].",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions This study provided important insight into the ISS microbial diversity with a focus on significant differences between the closed habitats of the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The NGS data, supported by traditional microbiology techniques and selective molecular bioburden estimation assays, provided a preliminary but detailed report on the ISS environmental microbiome. Future work will be able to build on these initial results by determining how stable that environment is over time. In contrast with the JPL cleanrooms, the most common organisms in the ISS environment were members of the Actinobacteria that are frequently associated with humans. As on the ISS, human traffic is common in the cleanrooms, but clearly the more stringent procedures possible on Earth are more effective in eradicating these organisms. The current results provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of future ISS procedural changes. This study also allowed an evaluation of the utility of coupling PMA treatment with NGS sequencing for more accurate estimation of viable population. The bacterial diversity of each sample decreased after the PMA treatment but this was strongly associated with the sampling site. Since exposure to viable organisms is best minimized, it is important to know which areas are most problematic and hence should be avoided and/or targeted for more stringent cleaning conditions. It is clear from the results presented here that viable cell studies with PMA can provide this information. It was also found that the relative numbers of various types of viable cells in each sample closely resembled the distribution obtained when all (dead and viable) cells were considered. This is likely to be a usual result unless the population at a sampling site has been recently and dramatically changed such that the prior dominant organisms have been replaced in only the pool of viable cells.",

Copyright notice ID: 4624184 PMID: 26502721 Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment.Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-015-0116-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: International Space Station, Air, Surface, Microbiome, Closed habitat, Cleanroom, Propidium monoazideBackground The microbial characterization of the International Space Station (ISS) has been mostly limited to traditional culture-based microbiology and selective molecular biology methods, such as Sanger sequencing, for supporting tasks such as water remediation, food safety, and crewmember health [1–5]. Since built environments are known to have specific microbiomes [6], it is of the highest interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific community to explore the environmental microbiome of the ISS as a closed environment. Moreover, the National Research Council (NRC) specifically recommended that NASA study changes in microbial populations in response to selective pressure associated with microgravity, which characterizes life aboard the ISS [7]. Previous studies show that permanent changes have occurred within the microbial species during experiments aboard the ISS [8, 9]. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses are now broadly implemented in many microbiology-related scientific fields, especially in microbial ecology [10, 11] and human microbiome projects [12, 13], use of these techniques for closed habitats has just begun [14] and warrants more research. “Deep” sequencing of ISS samples can answer questions on abundance and diversity of the microorganisms. However, differentiating viable and yet-to-be-cultivable microbial populations requires an appropriate sample processing technology [15]. The use of the reagent propidium monoazide (PMA) before DNA extraction eliminates cells with a compromised membrane. The PMA-based assay thus allows for a more accurate approximation of the viable microbial community in terms of richness as well as abundance [15]. Due to the technically rigorous methods required for culturing many microorganisms, characterization of human-associated microbial populations in the ISS environment remains a significant challenge. However, it is important to monitor the presence of any opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms. As long-duration human missions are planned in the future, detection of human pathogens and possible mitigation practices must be developed. In addition, understanding of the ISS microbiome could facilitate the necessary maintenance of this closed habitat and thereby assist in preventing degradation of its components by some microorganisms [4]. Both ISS environment and cleanrooms on Earth are maintained by high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters. Importantly, considerable prior knowledge of the microbial communities associated with these cleanrooms exists from prior studies. The ISS has been exposed to these communities indirectly by the fact that some of the cargos sent to the ISS were packaged in these specific NASA cleanrooms. As in the case of the ISS closed habitat, the Earth-based cleanrooms are controlled for humidity, temperature, and circulation. Furthermore, NASA quality assurance engineers perform periodic audits to ensure that certified-facility cleanliness levels conform to the requirements delineated for both the ISS and Earth cleanrooms. The ISS environment is zero gravity with exposure to space radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels. By necessity the air is re-circulated whereas on Earth the cleanrooms are constantly replenished with fresh air. An important difference is human habitation, which does not occur in the Earth cleanrooms. However, the human traffic in Earth cleanrooms is actually rather high (at least 50+ people in a given working day) when compared to the ISS where only 6 astronauts are allowed at a single time. This study is the first to analyze samples from the ISS air and surface using the traditional (colony counts [i.e., cultivable bacteria]) and state-of-the-art molecular techniques (adenosine triphosphate [ATP] and quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] assays) to measure the abundance of microorganisms (i.e., live and dead cells). Furthermore, the abundance and diversity of viable bacterial community were assessed using molecular methods (PMA treatment followed by qPCR [i.e., bacterial burden] or Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing [i.e., microbial diversity]). Additionally, the microbial diversity of the ISS was compared with samples from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) cleanrooms, which also represent closed and environmentally controlled built ecosystems.Results Microbial burden The samples analyzed during this study were the following: ISS HEPA filter particulates, vacuum cleaner bag components of ISS (ISS Debris), JPL Class 10 K cleanroom (JPL-SAF Debris), and JPL Class 1 K cleanroom (JPL-103 Debris) (Table 1). Microbial burdens estimated via traditional cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods are given in Table 2. The bacteria capable of growth in nutrient-rich media were in the range of 105 CFU per gram in the ISS HEPA filter sample and an order of magnitude greater (106 CFU per gram) for the ISS Debris. Relatively, the bacterial populations were larger in the ISS Debris sample than in the JPL cleanroom debris samples. When compared to the ISS Debris, the JPL-SAF Debris harbored an order of magnitude smaller bacterial population (105 CFU per gram) and the JPL-103 Debris sample was two orders of magnitude fewer (1.4 × 104 CFU per gram). In general, cultivable fungi were less represented than bacteria in all samples tested. The cultivable fungal population was two logs less for the ISS samples when compared to their bacterial counts, whereas the JPL cleanroom samples exhibited one-log difference. The ISS Debris possessed a similar fungal burden as that of the JPL-SAF Debris sample, which is higher than the more stringent JPL-103 area. The ISS HEPA harbored less fungi when compared to the ISS Debris. Table 1.

This trend was not noticed in the samples that were treated with PMA (viable bacterial population), where ~107 16S rRNA gene copies per gram accounted for all samples except in the JPL-SAF, which exhibited ~108 16S rRNA gene copies. The percentage of the viable bacterial population (PMA-treated samples) was ~1.7 % in the ISS HEPA, ~2.7 % in ISS Debris, and ~4.5 % in the JPL-103 samples. However, approximately 67 % of the bacteria in the JPL-SAF Debris were viable. The total ATP contents derived from both dead and alive cells were in the range of 107 relative light unit (RLU) per gram, except for the sample collected from the Class 1 K JPL-103 cleanroom, which showed ~2.6 × 106 RLU per gram. The microbial estimation carried out via an intracellular ATP assay (viable cells only) indicated that only 1.7 % of the total microorganisms were viable in the ISS HEPA sample. In the case of the ISS Debris sample, this percentage was much higher (75 %); similarly, JPL-SAF and JPL-103 constituted approximately 11 % and 46 % viable microorganisms, respectively.Culture-based microbial diversity The 16S rRNA sequencing-based identification and phylogenetic affiliation of the bacterial and fungal strains isolated during this study are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. Among 41 bacterial strains isolated and identified, 36 belonged to 29 different species, five strains were only identified to the genus level. The majority of the identified isolates belong to Firmicutes and only four strains were affiliated to the members of the Proteobacteria group. The highest number of isolates was represented by Bacillus and Staphylococcus genera. While Bacillus was dominant in both ISS samples, Staphylococcus was only present in ISS Debris. Both genera were either absent or underrepresented in the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 samples. Single representatives of other spore-forming lineages were also identified (Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, and Solibacillus). Notably, five strains belonging to the B. anthracis-cereus-thuringiensis group were isolated from the HEPA filter, and more detailed phylogenetic, pathogenic, and whole genome sequence characterizations are underway to confirm the functional characteristics of these isolates. The pathogenic properties specific to B. anthracis were not present in these five strains (data not shown). Among 19 fungal strains sequenced, 13 strains were identified to six different species. Out of 19 fungal strains, 16 were isolated from the ISS samples and the other three strains were from JPL samples. All the cultivated fungal strains affiliated phylogenetically to the members of the Ascomycota phylum. The most common fungal isolate in the ISS samples was Aspergillus niger, although other diverse species of Aspergillus were also identified, along with Penicillium as the second most dominant genus (Additional file 1: Table S1). Based on these results, most of the cultivated bacteria or fungi from the ISS locations were not noticed in the Earth-analog cleanrooms.Pyrosequencing-derived bacterial diversity The number of pyrosequences belonging to various bacterial phyla and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is presented in Additional file 1: Table S2. Approximately, 100,000 reads of bacterial pyrosequences of >500 bp in length were generated from eight samples during this study. When the software mothur [16] was employed for the bioinformatics analysis, ~71 % of the sequences were deemed to be of good quality and used for further analysis, resulting in 70,669 sequences (Additional file 1: Table S2). Among PMA-untreated samples, the ISS Debris yielded the highest number of sequences (30,111 reads) whereas the lowest number of sequences was seen in the ISS HEPA (1,720). Likewise, more sequences were retrieved from the JPL-SAF (8,482 reads) as compared with the JPL-103 (5,062) sample. Contrary to the pyrosequence abundance, higher numbers of OTUs were present in the JPL-SAF sample (1,448 OTUs) than in the ISS Debris (452 OTUs) sample. However, as noticed in the pyrosequence abundance, the number of OTUs was also higher in the JPL-103 sample (301 OTUs) as compared to the ISS HEPA (133 OTUs) sample. The PMA-untreated samples constituted ~65 % of the high-quality sequences, while only 35 % of the sequences were retrieved from PMA-treated samples (25,294 sequences). Among the PMA-treated (viable) portions, ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples possessed ~38 % and 60 % of sequences, respectively. Similar to the ISS Debris sample, a higher percent of viable sequences was retrieved from the JPL-SAF Debris (77 %) but surprisingly, only ~3 % of the viable sequences were from the PMA-treated JPL-103 Debris sample. Almost all of the viable bacterial pyrosequences retrieved from the ISS HEPA filter were members of Corynebacterium. This organism was also dominant in the ISS Debris sample (Additional file 1: Table S2). Genera such as Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus were only present in the ISS Debris sample. While the ISS-HEPA sample contained fewer sequence reads representing only five genera, the ISS Debris sample was dominated by low abundance of more diverse genera (Stenotrophomonas, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Delftia). Bacillus species were predominant when traditional cultivation methods were employed (Additional file 1: Table S1), but Bacillus pyrosequences were not retrieved. When PMA-treated samples from the ISS samples were compared to the Earth-analog cleanroom samples, the dominant phyla were found to be very similar (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes). However, on the genus level, the JPL-SAF yielded many more viable sequences representing diverse genera (data not shown).Illumina-derived bacterial diversity The Illumina sequencing generated ~6.8 million high-quality reads, which is ~100 times more coverage than was obtained with pyrosequencing yield Additional file 2: Figure S1. Since Illumina sequences were short (~150 bp each), it was not possible to reliably resolve taxonomic affiliation beyond the genus level. We characterized high-quality reads using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier [17] and summarized community composition at multiple taxonomic levels. Among the ISS-associated samples, profiles were dominated by Actinobacteria, Bacilli, and Clostridia, while samples from the JPL-associated sites maintained higher levels of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 1). At the family level, the differences between ISS and JPL profiles were substantial, with complete distinction between the two sites using actinobacterial members alone—the ISS samples were dominated by Corynebacterium, while the actinobacterial groups among JPL samples were predominantly Geodermatophilaceae. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Taxonomic profiles of R1 samples at the class levelActinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla together constituted 80 % or more in all cases. When compared on the family level, sequences associated with any family did not exceed more than 10 % of the total sequences. Characteristics of bacterial phyla that are dominant during this study are depicted in Table 3. A clear-cut trend was noticed on the presence of bacterial phylum dominance on the ISS as well as in the Earth-analog cleanroom samples. Viable sequences arising from Actinobacteria were the most abundant in the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples (~95 and ~66 %, respectively), while Proteobacteria was present in the least numbers (0.41 and ~3 %, respectively). Among these three dominant phyla, the lowest percentage was found for Firmicutes and differed significantly between cleanroom samples as well (JPL-SAF: 11.05 % and JPL-103: 0.98 %). In-depth analysis showed that the ISS HEPA sample accumulated more sequences of the genus Corynebacterium than ISS Debris sample. In addition to the latter, the ISS Debris had sequences associated with the order Actinomycetales and the genus Staphylococcus. In contrast, the JPL-SAF Debris sample possessed larger numbers of Bacillus and unclassified Proteobacteria genera sequences, whereas JPL-103 Debris mimicked ISS locations and members of Actinobacteria were more dominant.

Hierarchical clustering of samples using genus taxonomic profiles resulted in clustering of samples by collection site but not strong clustering of paired PMA or no PMA samples (Fig. 2). Both the negative binomial test and Fisher’s exact test provided valuable information and supported the hierarchical clustering scenario. Searching for differentially abundant genus-level groups with significant P values using the negative binomial test, we saw that the vast majority of differentially abundant taxa were relatively depleted in the PMA-treated group. The only well-represented genera that were relatively enriched were Clostridium (0.34 % vs. 2.46 %, P = 0.009) and Rheinheimera (0.005 % vs. 0.472 %, P = 7E-06). In contrast, genera such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Neisseria were all relatively enriched in the untreated samples. Alpha diversity estimators also indicated a significant drop in diversity associated with PMA treatment. On average, PMA samples had 48 % fewer OTUs than their untreated pairs (paired T-test P = 0.004). This consistent reduction in the PMA samples was also true for Faith’s diversity, Chao1, and Shannon diversity measures (Fig. 3) and is consistent with the depletion of many taxa identified by differential abundance analysis. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering of samples using taxonomic profiles at the genus level (R1 dataset). The taxonomic profiles clustered based on sampling location. The color scale reflects log-normalized proportional values (e.g. −1 ~ 10 %, −2 ~ 1 %, −3 ~ 0.1 %). JPL-SAF samples clustering together and showing several unique low abundance members were not found in the JPL-103 Debris and ISS samples (e.g., Mollicutes, Nitrospira, and members of Chloroflexi). Rows and columns are clustered independently using the furthest neighbor algorithm with a Euclidean distance metric. o order, f family, g genusFig. 3. Open in a new tab PMA treatment is associated with a reduction in alpha diversity. Alpha diversity values are normalized as a percentage of their mean value across all eight samples in the chartTo better characterize the shared community composition among samples, beta-diversity metrics (e.g., Bray-Curtis distances) were computed and evaluated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Figure 4 displays PCoA plots associated with the R1 dataset. The samples from the same site are highly similar in composition regardless of PMA treatment. Using Procrustes analysis, we compared PCoA plots generated for both the R1 and R2 datasets. In this case, Procrustes analysis was employed to transform the R2-based principal coordinate set (by rotation, scaling, and translation) to minimize the distances between corresponding points in the R1 principal coordinate space. We found that virtually identical distances were derived between the R1 and R2 PCoA plots, further supporting the clustering of PMA and untreated paired samples. This high-resolution comparison stood in contrast to broader composition comparisons, such as the hierarchical clustering above. At the OTU level, the bacterial composition was strongly associated with the sampling site, and the reduced overall diversity of PMA treatment did not dramatically impact the composition relative to sample origin. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analysis plot (R1 data) based on Bray-Curtis distances. Percentage of variance explained by each principal coordinate axis is shown in parentheses Pyrosequencing-derived archaeal diversity When the samples were subjected to the archaeal characterization, neither qPCR nor PCR for next-generation sequencing generated archaeal amplification products (data not shown). It is likely that the presence of archaea in these samples was at a very low concentration (<100 gene copies per PCR reaction), below the detection limits of the technology [14]. Alternatively, materials associated with the dust samples might have inhibited the archaeal DNA amplification. However, this is unlikely because the dust samples spiked with a purified archaeal DNA did exhibit an appropriate band after PCR amplification (data not shown).Pyrosequencing-derived fungal diversity In total, ~35,000 fungal pyrosequences were retrieved from the eight samples. The detailed breakdown of the number of sequences and OTUs is given in Table 4. The comparison is made on the class level, as fungal taxonomy is not as well described on the genus level as bacterial taxonomy when it comes to sequencing of environmental substrates. The fungal OTUs represented 153 distinct taxa. Most OTUs were obtained for three classes: Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Tremellomycetes. As noticed for the bacterial abundance, fungal species richness was also location specific. The dry cleanroom surfaces were found to harbor different fungal species (mostly Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes) whereas ISS samples possessed more Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Exobasidiomycetes members.

In contrast, viable fungal sequences for Dothideomycetes and Tremellomycetes were common in the ISS Debris samples. Viable fungal diversity was far higher in the JPL-SAF Debris sample than in JPL-103 Debris. The JPL-SAF Debris sample revealed the highest diversity that are viable and the highest number of sequences. The great number of Eurotiomycetes sequences was confirmed by cultivation of Aspergillus and Penicillium isolates from the ISS HEPA and ISS debris.Significant differences of microbial communities between ISS and Earth cleanroom samples The differences between the ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiomes were assessed using multivariate statistics. Independent analyses of bacterial sequences derived from pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing revealed a significant difference in the community profile of ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiomes. These differences are displayed in ordination analyses (Additional file 3: Figure S2) and are supported by Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analyses (Additional file 1: Table S4). Irrespective of the sample origin, the viable community profile was highly similar to the total community profile, revealing no significant differences in PERMANOVA or MRPP indices. However, the differences between the viable and total community profile were outweighed by the substantial differences of the ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiome, which ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 concerning the chance-corrected within-group agreement (Additional file 1: Table S4). Bacterial and fungal taxa that showed a significant difference between ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom samples are presented in Additional file 3: Figure S2.Discussion The safety and health of spaceflight crewmembers are of the highest importance for current and future missions. Individuals living and/or working in built environments are often susceptible to health issues associated with microorganisms [18, 19]. Moreover, the microbial ecology of ISS remains largely unknown, as study efforts have been mostly focused on microbiological surveillance using cultivation procedures. The NRC recommended use of state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques to develop better microbial monitoring of future closed habitat(s) and response system(s) against potential biohazards originating from microbiological sources, using the ISS as a test bed [1, 4]. Exploration of the microbial diversity associated with unusual built-in environments such as the ISS would further contribute to the indoor microbiome research. This will benefit the development of spaceflight applications as well as basic and applied research on Earth. The main goal of this study was to determine ISS air and surface viable microbiomes and unveil the differences of viable microbiomes on the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The ISS is a very unique environment due to microgravity, and a suitable Earth analog of this ecosystem is not available. The cleanrooms used for comparison in this study are environmentally controlled and represent oligotrophic conditions in an Earth-based setting. Comprehensive characterization and cataloguing of microbial species in NASA cleanrooms has been taking place since the 1970s. This extensive data set renders these facilities the best-characterized closed environments with limited human traffic that the ISS samples can be compared with [20–24]. A lower incidence of cultivable microorganisms in Earth cleanrooms than ISS surfaces suggests that regular thorough maintenance and cleaning practices are required to reduce microbial burden in closed habitats. Multiple studies have used PMA for the estimation of viable bioburden, but they were mostly interpreted by qPCR [25–27], next-generation sequencing [15, 28, 29], or PhyloChipG3 [15]. The utilization of PMA combined with Illumina MiSeq technology for exploring viable microbiome of ISS-related environmental surfaces is not yet reported. The NGS technology resulting in information on millions of base pairs might have included genetic information from dead cells including contaminant DNA associated with the sample processing reagents [30, 31]. Thus, PMA treatment would eliminate these contaminants, making it possible to elucidate viable microbiomes. However, it was documented that PMA might not work for all kinds of microbial populations, especially spores where the dye was not able to penetrate the dead but intact spores [32]. Despite this, none of the other current methodologies can precisely estimate viable populations; PMA treatment has the highest potential to lead to the substantial differentiation between dead and live cells [15]. The statistical analysis of the viable bacterial community in this study revealed the significant variance in viable microbiome (Fig. 4; Additional file 1: Table S3 and S4), between the ISS and the cleanroom samples. The ISS HEPA filter was in service for ~40 months whereas debris collected from the ISS surface was only 1 day old (Table 1). The HEPA filter system employed in ISS was designed to revitalize the air by passing through a heat-exchange process. Hence, particulates associated with ISS HEPA filter might have been exposed to drier conditions than the crew living quarter debris (relative humidity >50 %) and therefore the microorganisms that could withstand dry conditions only survived in the HEPA filter. Any microbial species that could withstand a prolonged period of time (~40 months during this study) requires survival capabilities against harsh conditions, and members of the Actinobacteria phylum are known to withstand desiccation, dry conditions, and high pH [33, 34], which explains their abundance in ISS HEPA filters (~95.28 %; Table 3). Comparatively, sequences of viable Actinobacteria were retrieved in more numbers in ISS surface debris (~66 %) than in Earth cleanroom debris (~25 %) samples. The members of Actinobacteria phylum represent human skin commensals and also soil-borne microorganisms [35]. The dominance of Actinobacteria might be due to the presence of astronauts who live and perform work activities on board the ISS. However, characterization of astronauts’ skin microbiome is warranted and such studies will add more insights into the source of these bacteria associated with the ISS environmental surfaces and atmosphere. Actinobacteria have been previously reported in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and these non-spore-forming bacteria were considered a potential contamination risk of spacecraft due to their resistance to desiccation and ultraviolet radiation [34]. In this study, the viable population of the Actinobacteria did not constitute high population of the Earth cleanrooms, although this can be explained by the different gowning procedures required before entering these facilities unlike practiced in the ISS. In this study, both the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples contained high number of viable Corynebacterium sequences whereas Propionibacterium sequences were more in the ISS Debris sample. Since these microorganisms require special growth conditions, they were not isolated when traditional cultivation methods were employed during this study. Although the Propionibacterium species represent natural skin commensals, P. acnes is considered an opportunistic pathogen that leads to various infections [36, 37]. Similar concerns refer to Corynebacterium, which has received attention for being a genus containing several opportunistic pathogens [38]. Even though viable sequences of these opportunistic pathogens were retrieved from both ISS locations, their virulence characteristics are to be studied before correlating their influence on human health in a closed habitat. The risk of acquiring infection from opportunistic bacterial and fungal pathogens might pose a threat to crewmembers’ health and needs to be studied in the future. In contrast, both of the Earth-based cleanrooms contained more Proteobacterial members when compared to the ISS locations. This trend has previously been seen in the studies of cleanroom-associated microbiomes when Sanger sequencing or DNA microarray method(s) were attempted, where human-associated Proteobacteria constituted the dominating phylum [11, 15, 39]. Low abundance (<100 sequences) of Gammaproteobacteria, human commensals, in ISS samples appears reasonable since at any given time only a maximum of six astronauts are present [40]. Despite more human traffic in Earth cleanrooms, lower abundance of Gammaproteobacterial members were noticed. This might be due to the fact that appropriate countermeasures (cleaning) were in place to prevent contamination in these indoor facilities. The high abundance of Acinetobacter and Brevundimonas in the ISS Debris sample showed that these microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and associated with the debris [41] suggesting that their presence cannot be avoided. The members of the oligotrophic class Sphingomonodaceae were more abundant in the JPL-SAF sample and were previously found to persist in these nutrient-deprived environments [42]. Among the Firmicutes, species belonging to the genus Staphylococcus were common on the ISS surfaces but not present in the ISS air. This indicates that co-inhabiting astronauts might have shed more skin microorganisms that were captured by the vacuum cleaner than the HEPA system. The cultivation-dependent method confirmed the presence of several Staphylococcus species in the ISS surface samples and these species were not isolated from other samples investigated during this study. In contrast, the higher abundance of viable Bacillus species in the JPL-SAF (Class 10 K) sample suggests that they might have originated from the surrounding soil [43]. Lower abundance of Bacillus species in the more stringent JPL-103 cleanroom (Class 1 K) further reiterated that appropriate maintenance could regulate microbial presence in a much cleaner indoor environment [42]. The dominant cultivable isolates of bacteria from both ISS air and ISS surfaces were spore-forming Bacillus. As members of this genus are common inhabitants of soil and dust, they were highly probable to be cultured from the ISS samples on a nutrient-rich media. When the phylogenetic affiliation results for the cultivable strains were compared to the NGS results, only Illumina-derived deep sequencing yielded Bacillus sequences. In our previous efforts, Bacillus eluded detection when traditional Sanger sequencing [44], PhyloChip G2 technology [45], or 454-pyrosequencing analysis of amplicons were employed [11]. Likewise, in this study, the pyrosequencing method again did not retrieve sequences of spore formers. In contrast, the Illumina method frequently yielded the sequences indicative of the spore formers, including members of the genus Bacillus and Paenibacillus. The absence of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus sequences might be either attributed to the specificity of the iTag primer sets or the efficiency of the DNA extraction method employed. However, the Promega Maxwell-16 DNA extraction system used in this study was successful in extracting nucleic acids from the pure cultures of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus. Despite the same sample preparation, the Illumina-based sequencing generated more reads (40–2400 times; average ~100 times), thus providing a deeper coverage of microbial diversity than the 454 platform. Choosing an appropriate technology is important when abundance and richness of the microbial diversity are considered. Although Illumina can be employed to understand yet-to-be cultivated microorganisms, the use of well-established traditional techniques should not be completely abandoned. Fungal strains have been detected on the ISS multiple times as actively growing molds on the environmental surfaces or responsible microorganisms deteriorating the components of ISS hardware [4]. The abundance of the fungal molds in indoor environments was reported to be associated with invasive infections and allergies [46, 47]. Therefore, a high number of fungal isolates from the ISS locations confirmed a need for continuous monitoring of the ISS for fungal populations. Aspergillus niger was the predominant isolate, and although it does not have the potential to cause disease at the same rate as other Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, A. flavus), it was correlated with pulmonary and ear infections [48]. Aspergillus species are repeatedly isolated in indoor microbiomes [49]. The detection of multiple isolates of A. niger is consistent with its frequent presence in built environments including ISS surfaces [50]. However, its survival capability, proliferation, and molecular alteration in response to ISS microgravity conditions need to be studied further. On the other hand, A. niger is known for production of many beneficial substances. The potential for production of novel beneficial secondary metabolites under microgravity conditions needs to be explored for use in diverse biotechnological and pharmaceutical fields [51, 52].Conclusions This study provided important insight into the ISS microbial diversity with a focus on significant differences between the closed habitats of the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The NGS data, supported by traditional microbiology techniques and selective molecular bioburden estimation assays, provided a preliminary but detailed report on the ISS environmental microbiome. Future work will be able to build on these initial results by determining how stable that environment is over time. In contrast with the JPL cleanrooms, the most common organisms in the ISS environment were members of the Actinobacteria that are frequently associated with humans. As on the ISS, human traffic is common in the cleanrooms, but clearly the more stringent procedures possible on Earth are more effective in eradicating these organisms. The current results provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of future ISS procedural changes. This study also allowed an evaluation of the utility of coupling PMA treatment with NGS sequencing for more accurate estimation of viable population. The bacterial diversity of each sample decreased after the PMA treatment but this was strongly associated with the sampling site. Since exposure to viable organisms is best minimized, it is important to know which areas are most problematic and hence should be avoided and/or targeted for more stringent cleaning conditions. It is clear from the results presented here that viable cell studies with PMA can provide this information. It was also found that the relative numbers of various types of viable cells in each sample closely resembled the distribution obtained when all (dead and viable) cells were considered. This is likely to be a usual result unless the population at a sampling site has been recently and dramatically changed such that the prior dominant organisms have been replaced in only the pool of viable cells.Methods Sample characteristics Particulate materials were collected from the ISS HEPA filter element (ISS HEPA) and vacuum cleaner bag components (ISS Debris) used aboard the ISS as well as at two cleanrooms at JPL (one each originating from the SAF and building 103, Pasadena, CA), during this study. Table 1 lists sample characteristics, usage time of the material collection devices or system(s), model, make, and cleanroom conditions where the devices were used. The materials collected using the HEPA filter system represented the air and the vacuum cleaner bag represented the surface locations.ISS HEPA The environmental control system (ECS) aboard the ISS includes a distributed ventilation system that contains HEPA filter elements to remove suspended particulate matter from the cabin atmosphere and protect humidity control and air purification equipment from debris accumulation and biofouling [53]. Particle counts are not routinely measured aboard crewed spacecraft. A study conducted during space shuttle mission STS-32 (January 1990) found that the particle size distribution approximated a class 100,000 cleanroom for particles <2.5 μm, a class 400,000 cleanroom for particles 2.5 μm to <10 μm, and a class 3000 cleanroom for particles >10 μm [53, 54]. The particle size distributions are defined using cleanroom standard definitions (FED-STD-209 1992). The HEPA filters used aboard the ISS retain 99.97 % particles of 0.3 μm via a pleated borosilicate media. A 20-mesh (841-μm sieve openings) inlet screen located at the filter element’s face removes larger debris and fibers. The pleated, non-woven borosilicate HEPA filter media was installed by Flanders Filters, Inc. (Washington, NC) in the filter element housing. Flanders Filters, Inc.’s commercial “NaturalAire” cut-to-fit filtration media has the greatest similarity to the ISS HEPA filter media (http://flandersfilters.com/products/naturalaire/). Twenty-one filter elements are distributed throughout the ISS in several modules and astronauts replace them on a scheduled maintenance cycle ranging from 2.5 to 5 years, depending on the location. The part number of the HEPA filter system analyzed during this study was SV810010-1 and the serial number was 0049. The HEPA filter element analyzed during this study was manufactured in September 1998, installed in ISS on January 2008, and returned aboard space shuttle flight STS-134/ULF6 in late May 2011. This filter was installed in ISS Node 2 and was in service for 40 months, although the typical service time is only 30 months for this location. Typically, ground testing is performed to characterize a filter element’s pressure drop at various process air flow rates [53] after retrieval from the ISS, but in this case, the HEPA filter remained untouched in its shipment packaging from the time it was removed from the ISS until particulates were recovered at JPL for microbial characterization. The particulate materials collected from this sample were designated as ISS HEPA during this study.ISS debris The vacuum cleaner bag contained debris that had collected on the HEPA filter inlet screens. The vacuum cleaner bag components are representative of the collected debris (lint, food particles, skin/hair, and miscellaneous debris) that had been airborne in the cabin but had collected over time on the filter element inlet screen. The molecular microbial community analysis for the ISS vacuum bag debris (ISS Debris) was previously documented [14]. These results were utilized here for comparative purposes. The previous molecular characterizations of the ISS Debris sample were extended here with Illumina-based deep sequencing using archived DNA aliquots [14]. Sample characteristics of the ISS Debris are described in Table 1. Briefly, during the period of ISS Expeditions 30 and 31, reports by some crewmembers cited differences in the cabin environment compared to earlier experience as well as allergic responses to the cabin environment. One of the noted observations was a high level of visible dust in the ISS Node 3 cabin, to the extent it was sticking to the walls. Flight surgeons indicated that this had been reported not just in Node 3 but also throughout the US on-orbit segment and expressed a concern for crew health. Dust on the ISS is expected, with humans being major contributors (via skin shedding, eating, exercising, etc.). Other sources such as on-orbit maintenance activities can release dust from sources such as payloads and systems, clothing, and visiting vehicles. As a precautionary measure, in the middle of 2012, an investigation was launched to define and mitigate dust sources and to determine if exposure to dust might elicit an adverse effect on crew health. As a result of these crewmember reports, particulate and fiber debris samples were collected during ISS Expedition 31 using a handheld portable vacuum cleaner and returned to Earth aboard Soyuz flight 29S in early July 2012 for analyses. Details of the novel “Prime” vacuum cleaner developed for NASA habitats were reported elsewhere [55]. Portions of the samples were aseptically collected for microbiological testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC), with the remaining bag and its contents repacked in a biological hood, sealed, and shipped to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for particle size testing, as well as to JPL to determine their molecular microbiological composition. The vacuum cleaner bag was shipped via FedEx at room temperature with instructions that the samples not be irradiated in transport.Earth analogs For comparison, particles collected from two JPL cleanroom floors using a Nilfisk GM80CR vacuum cleaner (the disposable bag part number is 81620000; Morgantown, PA) were analyzed (Table 1). Cleanroom certification is based on the maximum number of particles greater than 0.5 μm per cubic foot of air. The air within Class 1 K cleanrooms is maintained at fewer than 1000 particulates per cubic foot, Class 10 K cleanrooms are allowed to harbor a density of 10,000 particles per cubic foot, and so on. The cleanroom samples were from (a) the JPL-SAF cleanroom floor where various Mars mission spacecraft were built (Class 10 K; JPL-SAF Debris) and (b) JPL building 103 where non-mission critical activities were conducted (Class 1 K; JPL-103 Debris). The vacuum cleaner bag debris from the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 buildings was transported to the microbiology laboratories for storage. Sample processing was carried out immediately after aseptic collection of the materials, usually within 7 days from the retrieval of the vacuum bags from the cleanrooms. Both Earth-analog samples were processed at the same time as the ISS Debris samples. However, the ISS HEPA sample was received ~3 months later and hence was analyzed separately.Sample processing All samples were subjected to a variety of microbiological and molecular techniques to elucidate composition of cultivable, viable, and total microorganisms. Independent of the samples taken to cultivate bacterial and fungal analyses, subsamples of the same samples were taken for DNA extraction. Weighing vacuum debris samples was possible, whereas the HEPA filter elements were divided into small pieces and particulates associated with the pieces were aseptically collected using sterile scalpels before being quantitatively measured. Approximately 1 g of each vacuum debris and HEPA filter associated particle was weighed and placed into a sterile tube containing 25 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortexed for 1 min. After vigorous mixing, large particles were allowed to settle, and aliquots of samples were carefully siphoned and allocated for culture-based (1 mL) and culture-independent analyses (15 mL).Traditional culture-based microbial examination For estimating bacterial populations, after suitable serial tenfold dilution in sterile PBS, 100 μL of the sample suspension was spread onto two plates of R2A media (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25 °C for 2–7 days. For the fungal population enumeration, 100 μL was spread onto two plates of potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25 °C for 2–7 days. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted and reported as CFU/g of material. Identifications and phylogenetic affiliations were carried out via sequencing for both bacteria and fungi by targeting the 16S rRNA gene [42] and the ITS region [56], respectively. When identifications were ambiguous, sequencing of an additional gene (gyrB) was performed to confirm the phylogenetic identity of the purified bacterial isolates [57, 58]. The nucleotide sequences of bacteria (KT763339–KT763368) and fungi (KT832780-KT832790) were deposited in GenBank.Sample processing for molecular analysis The biological materials associated with each sample (15 mL) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of microbial cells, spores, and exogenous nucleic acid fragments greater than 100 bp in a final volume of 2.5 mL. All filtered samples were then divided into three separate aliquots: the first aliquot (1000 μL) was subjected to PMA pretreatment (viability assessment), the second (1000 μL) was an untreated environmental sample (viable + nonviable; total DNA), and the third (500 μL) was used for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis (see below). For measuring viable microbial population, one aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension (1000 μL) was treated with 12.5 μL of PMA (2 mM; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA) to a final concentration of 25 μM [26, 32], followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 5 min at room temperature [15]. The sample was exposed to PhAST blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L., Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min (in parallel with the non-PMA-treated sample). This step enabled blocking DNA from dead cells [15]. The samples were then split in half and one half was subjected to bead beating with the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) with parameters set at 5 m/s for 60 s. The second half of the unprocessed sample was then combined with the mechanically disrupted counterpart before DNA was extracted via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions [59]. Resulting DNA suspensions (100 μL each) were stored at −20 °C.Quantitation of total and viable microorganisms using molecular methods ATP assay A bioluminescence assay was performed to determine the total ATP and intracellular ATP from all samples using the CheckLite HS kit (Kikkoman Corp., Noda, Japan), as described previously [60]. Briefly, to determine the total ATP (dead and viable microbes), 100-μL sample aliquots (four replicates) were each combined with 100 μL of a cell lysing detergent (benzalkonium chloride) then incubated at room temperature for 1 min prior to the addition of 100 μL of a luciferin-luciferase reagent. The sample was mixed, and the resulting bioluminescence was measured with a luminometer, the Lumitester K-210 (Kikkoman Corp.). To determine intracellular ATP (viable microbes), 50 μL of an ATP-eliminating reagent (apyrase, adenosine deaminase) was added to a 500-μL portion of the sample and allowed to incubate for 30 min to remove any extracellular ATP, after which the assay for ATP was carried out, as described above, in four replicates, including sterile PBS as negative controls. As previously established, one RLU, the unit of measurement of ATP, was assumed to be approximately equal to one CFU [42].qPCR assay Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, targeting the 16S rRNA gene, was performed in triplicate with a CFX-96 thermal cycling Instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to quantify the bacterial burden. Bacteria-directed primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene 1369 F (5′-CGG TGA ATACGT TCY CGG-3′) and modified 1492R (5′-GGW TAC CTTGTT ACG ACT T-3′) were used for this analysis [61]. Each 25-μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), and 1 μL of template DNA. Purified DNA from B. pumilus cells served as the positive control and DNase/RNase-free molecular-grade distilled water (UltraPure, Gibco) was used as the negative control. These controls were included in all qPCR runs. Reaction conditions were as follows: a 3-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and a combined annealing and extension at 55 °C for 35 s.Molecular microbial diversity analysis using next-generation sequencing methods Pyrosequencing conditions Bacterial primers 28 F (5′-GAG TTT GAT CNT GGC TCA G-3′) and 519R (5′-GTN TTA CNG CGG CKG CTG-3′) were used to amplify ~500-bp fragments spanning the V1–V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Archaeal primers 341 F (5′-GYG CAS CAG KCG MGA AW-3′) and 958R (5′-GGA CTA CVS GGG TAT CTA AT-3′) were used to amplify ~600-bp fragments spanning the V3–V5 hypervariable regions of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene. A fungal primer set ITS1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) and ITS4R (5′-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3′) was employed to amplify ~600-bp fragments of the fungal ITS region. These primer pairs were tailored for pyrosequencing by adding a fusion linker and a proprietary 8-nt barcode sequence at the 5′ end of the forward primer and a biotin and fusion linker sequence at the 5′ end of the reverse primer [62]. A HotStarTaq Plus master mix kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to catalyze the PCR under the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, finalized by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. Resulting PCR products were purified via Diffinity Rapid Tip (Diffinity Genomics, Inc., West Henrietta, NY) chemistry and were then pooled accordingly. Small fragments were removed with Agencourt Ampure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). In preparation for FLX-Titanium sequencing (Roche, Nutley, NJ), resulting PCR amplicon fragment size and concentration were accurately measured with DNA 1000 chips using a Bioanalyzer 2100 automated electrophoresis station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a TBS-380 Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μL for strong positives (>10 ng/μL), 5 μL for weak positives (5 to 10 ng/μL), and 20 μL for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng/μL). This normalization step helped to ensure minimal bias favoring downstream amplification from initially strong PCR products. Approximately 9.6 × 106 molecules of ~600-bp double-stranded DNA were combined with 9.6 × 106 DNA capture beads and then subjected to emulsion PCR conditions. Following recovery and enrichment, bead-attached DNA molecules were denatured with NaOH and sequencing primers were annealed. A four-region 454 pyrosequencing run was performed on a GS PicoTiterPlate (PTP) using the Genome Sequencer FLX System, in accordance with manufacturer instructions (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Twenty-four to 30 tagged samples were applied to each quarter region of the PTP. All pyrosequencing procedures were performed at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX) in accordance with well-established protocols [62].Illumina sequencing conditions The library preparations for next-generation sequencing and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and DNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis (0.8 % agarose gel). The sequencing library was constructed using a MetaVx™ Library Preparation kit (GENEWIZ, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). In brief, 5–50 ng of DNA was used for amplicon generation to cover the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA. Indexed and universal adapters were added to the ends of the 16S rDNA amplicons by limited-cycle PCR. The DNA libraries were validated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and quantified using Qubit and real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA libraries were multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq following the instructions from the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) configuration was used for sequencing. The image analysis and base calling were processed using MiSeq Control Software. The initial taxonomy was performed on Illumina’s BaseSpace cloud computing platform.Bioinformatic analyses of bacterial pyrosequences High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing data were processed. Bacterial and archaeal sequences were processed and analyzed using the mothur software [16, 63]. Sequences were quality filtered by removing sequences that (a) did not contain the primer sequence, (b) contained an uncorrectable barcode, (c) were <250 nt in length, (d) had homopolymers longer than 8 nt, or (e) had a quality score of <25; and then demultiplexed using the respective sample nucleotide barcodes. These sequences were searched against the Greengenes reference database [64, 65] and clustered into OTUs based on their sequence similarity (97 %) with UCLUST [66]. A representative sequence was picked from each OTU and taxonomic classification was assigned using mothur’s Bayesian classifier [67] and Greengenes training sequences and taxonomy [64, 65].Bioinformatic analyses of fungal pyrosequences The sequences were run through ITSx 1.0.9 [68] to remove non-ITS sequences, assembly chimeras, and sequences for which none of the 3′ end of SSU rDNA or the 5′ end of 5.8S rDNA was detected. The ITS1 sub-region was extracted from the remaining sequences for further analyses. Chimera control was exercised through UCHIME 7 [69] using the UNITE chimera reference dataset [70] as reference corpus. The sequences were subjected to clustering and taxonomic assignment in the Sequence Clustering and Analysis of Tagged Amplicons (SCATA) next-generation sequencing analysis pipeline (http://scata.mykopat.slu.se) using the February 2014 release of UNITE as taxonomic reference corpus. The default sequence quality control settings of SCATA were used; however, the clustering threshold was set to 98.5 % [71]. All taxonomic affiliations proposed by SCATA were examined manually using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) 2.2.30 [72] in GenBank [73] and UNITE [74] and occasionally refined using the principles outlined in Koljalg et al. [75] and Nilsson et al. [76].Preprocessing of bacterial Illumina sequences The 12 sets of 16S rDNA V3 amplicon data were sequenced at GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ,), where the obtained reads were trimmed to remove primer sequences. The raw sequence dataset was composed of 10,241,173 paired-end reads, 150 bp in length, with exceptionally high quality (<0.1 % error rate) (Resphera DiscoveryTM protocol, Baltimore, MD). After trimming noisy reads and removal of low-quality and chimeric sequences, we identified a moderate level of expected contaminants, including chloroplast and mammalian mitochondrial sequence (range 0.0001–9.3 %), as well as a low level of unknown contaminants (range 0.01–1.8 %). Exploratory characterization of unknown contaminant representatives indicated nonspecific amplification mitochondrial sequences from various eukaryotic organisms. After completion of preprocessing, the resulting high-quality R1 and R2 read sets contained 9.1 M and 9.3 M sequences, respectively, with an average length of 128 bp. Due to the primer set and sequencing technology selected by the vendor, we were unable to merge paired-end sequences into longer consensus fragments as they did not overlap. Therefore, in this analysis, we compared our findings between the R1 (forward)- and R2 (reverse)-associated datasets to evaluate consistency. Across R1 and R2 datasets, each sample had on average 917,060 clean sequences. After clustering sequences into OTUs, OTU tables were rarefied to an even coverage of 525,000 sequences per sample. On average, Good’s coverage statistic for rarefied samples was 99.78 %, indicating we have observed the vast majority of OTU diversity in each community.Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial Illumina sequences Sequences were de-multiplexed using 5′ barcode identifiers and analyzed using the Resphera Discovery™ protocol (Baltimore, MD). Briefly, 16S rRNA sequence fragments were first screened in Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [77] for quality and length requiring: (a) trimming at the first 5-bp run of Phred quality scores below 20, (b) one ambiguous base call or less, and (c) a minimum final length of 125 bp after trimming of forward and reverse primer sequences. Passing sequences were screened for PhiX-174 spiked fragments and PCR-associated chimeras by UCHIME [69] (de novo mode). Non-chimeric reads were then filtered for contaminant chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences using the RDP classifier [17], followed by a broad nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN) [78] search of the GreenGenes 16S rRNA reference database [65] (v1.1) to identify potential unknown contaminants. The resulting high-quality dataset was clustered into de novo OTUs using UCLUST [66] with a 95 % identity threshold. OTU representatives were assigned to a taxonomic lineage using the RDP classifier trained on the Resphera 16S rRNA database (v1.1) requiring a minimum confidence score of 0.50.Statistical analyses To perform pairwise statistical comparisons of sample groups of interest, a negative binomial test implemented in DESeq [79] or Fisher’s exact test was utilized and controlled for false positives using the false discovery rate (FDR) [80]. For the comparison of bacterial pyrosequence and Illumina data and fungal pyrosequence analysis, multivariate statistical analyses of community profiles were performed using an “in-house R-script” employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac [81]. First, each dataset composed of OTU abundances per sample was rarefied to the lowest number of reads and a Bray-Curtis index was calculated. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times and the average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated for each dataset in order to avoid biases arising from rarefication. The Bray-Curtis distance was then utilized to calculate principal coordinate (PCoA) analyses, PERMANOVA (1000 permutations), and MRPP (1000 permutations).Availability of supporting data The data set supporting the results of this article is available in the  SRA repository, under SRA #280254.Acknowledgements Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.

A variety of bioactive compounds produced by fungi are used in pharmaceutical and food industries, agriculture, and beyond. However, some fungi are plant, animal, and human pathogens. Fungal pathogens could cause serious health complications in immunocompromised populations. Pathogenic fungi can produce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (melanins, siderophores, species-specific toxins) and immunologic potential. Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, filamentous fungus that is ubiquitous outdoors (soil, decaying vegetation) and indoors (hospitals, simulated closed habitats, etc.). Aspergillus fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g., noninvasive and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts. In on-going microbial observatory experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), molecular phylogeny and radiation resistance of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from a HEPA filter (1) and cupola wall (unpublished) of the ISS. Because A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathologies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we assessed several pathogenic characteristics of the ISS isolates in comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates, Af293 (2) and CEA10 (3). Virulence assessment in a larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 as significantly more lethal compared to both clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) (4). In addition, the ISS strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited significantly greater resistance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates (4, 5). The genomics of these ISS isolates might reveal the molecular mechanisms of the increased virulence. Subsequently, if the enhanced virulence is attributed to the microgravity, NASA potentially should consider developing countermeasures to protect the health of astronauts, whose immune systems are reported to be compromised under microgravity (6). In this study, we determined the draft genome sequences of A. fumigatus strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument with a paired-end module. A total of 27,987,752 and 10,752,032 paired-end reads of 101-nucleotides were collected for ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4. The NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (7) was used to filter the data for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). A total of 25,515,334 (~230× coverage) for ISSFT-021 and 8,466,430 (~75× coverage) for IF1SW-F4 high-quality vector-filtered reads were used for assembly with MaSuRCA (8) genome assembler (k-mer size = 70). The final assembly of the strain ISSFT-021 contains 301 scaffolds with a total size of 28,526,023 bp and an N50 contig length of 275.468 kb; the largest contigs assembled measures 813.103 kb and the G+C% was 49.41. Similarly, the final assembly of the IF1SW-F4 strain contains 208 scaffolds with a total size of 28,240,437 bp and an N50 contig length of 367.421 kb; the largest contig assembled measures 900.278 kb and the G+C content was 49.45%. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The whole-genome sequences of both the strains were deposited at DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers LWRT00000000 and LWRU00000000. The versions described in this paper are LWRT01000000 and LWRU01000000. These A. fumigatus strains were also deposited in the USDA Agricultural Research Station and DSMZ public culture collections.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.

INTRODUCTION The International Space Station (ISS) is a man-made closed habitat that functions as a platform to study the impact of the distinct space environment, which includes enhanced irradiation and microgravity on humans1–7, animals8,9, plants10–14 and microorganisms15–19. Most experiments conducted on board the ISS are precisely planned. Studied organisms are intentionally sent to the ISS to investigate the possible alterations in their physiology, using ground controls for comparison. However, one on-going ISS Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO) experiment focuses on studying hitchhikers that have followed humans and cargo aboard the ISS20. Thorough investigation of microbiological characteristics of closed habitats, like the ISS, are indispensable to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as manned long-term space flight missions are within reach. A deeper understanding of microbes that coexist in closed habitats with humans remains imperative to astronauts’ health and the overall maintenance of closed systems. Strict scrutiny of the microbiome and mycobiome of the ISS20–25, Mir26,27, and Skylab28, in the past, has revealed prevalence of fungal genera: Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus in space environments. These fungi can be both beneficial and detrimental to mankind, as they produce a myriad of commercially useful bioactive compounds29–34, while also causing allergies35, infections36,37 and biodeterioration of habitats38–40. Aspergillus fumigatus, one of many fungal isolates identified in a recent ISS-MO study22, is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus41. Its enormous adaptation capacity enables it to not only be omnipresent in the environment, but also to be a successful opportunistic pathogen42. A. fumigatus causes variety of health conditions spanning from allergies to potentially life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised individuals43,44. Initial characterization of two A. fumigatus ISS-isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, showed no outstanding differences in their genomes and secondary metabolites profiles when compared to clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293, however both isolates were significantly more lethal in a larval zebra fish model of IA45. Considering that A. fumigatus becomes more virulent in space and therefore potentially more dangerous to astronauts’ health, it was pertinent to further investigate molecular changes of ISS-isolated strains. Presented in this study are the unique differences observed in proteome of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, when compared to Af293 and CEA10. The goal of this study was to understand if the distinct environment of the ISS (low-nutrients, enhanced irradiation and microgravity) alters the proteome of A. fumigatus. Due to an existing gap in our understanding of how filamentous fungi molecularly adapt to space conditions, proteome investigation of these two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was prudent.2. METHODS 2.1. Isolation and identification of A. fumigatus. Procedures to isolate and identify A. fumigatus collected from the ISS were described previously45. In brief, HEPA filter associated particulates were scraped, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates22. Cupola surfaces were sampled with sterile polyester wipes assembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to space flight. After each sampling event on board the ISS, wipes were returned to JPL for subsequent processing. During that process, two of multiple isolates were identified via ITS region and subsequently whole genome sequencing (WGS) as A. fumigatus.2.2. Growth conditions. Af293, CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were cultivated for 5 days at 30°C on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 g/L NaNO3, 0.52 g/L KCl, 0.52 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g/L KH2PO4, 10 g/L D-glucose, 15 g/L agar supplemented with 1 mL/L of Hutner’s trace elements) covered with cellophane membrane. Each Petri plate (D=10 cm) was inoculated with 10*106 spores/plate. For supplementary comparison, each strain was also cultured in potato-dextrose (PD, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Czapek-dox (CD, BD Difco) liquid media for 2 days and 10 days, respectively.2.3. Protein extraction. Mycelia and spores from GMM agar plates were collected. The hyphae from the liquid media were collected on Whatman paper filter and washed with cell culture grade water. All samples were stored at −80 °C prior to protein extraction. The lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 μg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The hyphae from the liquid media were first homogenized on ice using a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Bohemia, NY) with a speed setting of 5 for 3–5 times (1 min/time, 30 sec pause). Subsequently, the crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2 mL cryotube with 0.5 mm glass beads three times (at 4 °C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 sec pauses in between). Mycelia from GMM were homogenized directly by bead beating due to their small volume. The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA).2.4. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. 200 μg proteins from each group were TCA-precipitated. Obtained protein pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolubilized in 25 μL TEAB (100 mM) and 25 μL 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Subsequently, proteins were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested overnight using mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). 40 μg of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (Af293 with TMT6-126, CEA10 with TMT6-127, ISSFT-021 with TMT6-128, and IF1SW-F4 with TMT6-130) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-131 label was used as a reference that contained an equal amount of peptides from each of the samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated into eight fractions using the Thermo Scientific Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1% (v/v) formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.2.5. LC-MS/MS analysis. An Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with the Thermo EASY-nLC ion source, 75 μm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and 75 μm × 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column was used to analyze the samples. Peptides were eluted at 45°C with a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3–30% solvent B (100 min), 30–50% solvent B (3 min), 50–90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400–1500) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2×105 in the Orbitrap with the 50 ms maximum injection time for MS scans. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with charge states 2–7, within a ±10 ppm mass window, using a 70 s dynamic exclusion function. MS2 scans (m/z 400–2000) were performed using the linear ion trap with the 35% CID collision energy. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid”, with an AGC target of 4×103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Subsequently, ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subjected to an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (m/z 100–500) generated the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a 55% collision energy, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5×103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.2.6. Proteome data processing. The Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Scientific) with searching engines Sequest-HT against an A. fumigatus Af293 protein database from  containing 9845 non-redundant sequences was used to search all MS/MS spectra. The following parameters: 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses were selected. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, whereas dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of peptide N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co-isolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from a protein was used to determine the total intensity of a reporter ion for that protein. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ions (TMT6–131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For the statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was Log2 transformed and technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. One-way ANOVA was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with p-value ≤ 0.05 were further evaluated for up- and down-regulation using a cut-off value of ≥ ±1 fold (Log2) change.3. RESULTS 3.1. Proteome analysis overview. Proteins with altered abundance in ISS-isolated strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, and clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10, were investigated upon extraction of total protein from each strain. Extracted proteins were digested into peptides and labeled using tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated, and analyzed via LC-MS/MS followed by spectrum/sequence matching using A. fumigatus Af293 protein database (). The abundance ratios of all identified proteins were normalized to Af293, that enabled identification of 553, 464 and 626 increased and 314, 289 and 317 decreased in abundance proteins in CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 strains respectively (Table S-1, Figure S-1). When compared to both, Af293 and CEA10, 60 proteins showed increased and 32 decreased abundance in space strains only (fold change (FC) > |2|) (Table S-2). AspGD GO Slim terms46 were used to study the distribution of differentially abundant proteins in space strains. Analysis of proteins with increased abundance revealed involvement of 14 proteins in carbohydrate metabolic processes, eight in stress responses, five in secondary metabolism and toxins biosynthesis, and two in pathogenesis whereas five, three, one and zero proteins showed respectively decreased abundance in these categories. Proteins associated with cellular amino acid metabolic process (6), lipid cellular homeostasis (3), metabolic processes (2), pathogenesis (2), and translation (2) exhibited increased abundance in space strains only (Figure 1). FungiDB47 was used to carry out GO term enrichment analysis to gain a general understanding of biological processes possibly affected by unique environment of the ISS. The results revealed that significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included secondary metabolic processes (40% of all up-regulated proteins), carbohydrate metabolic processes (23%), and response to chemical (~15%), whereas significantly over-represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), response to heat (6%), and mRNA metabolic processes (6%) (Table S-3).

Categories containing at least 2 up- or down-regulated proteins are presented.3.2. Secondary metabolism and toxins. The proteomic analysis revealed altered abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Table 1). Proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, including emodin O-methyltransferase TpcA (AFUA_4G14580), glutathione S-transferase TpcF (AFUA_4G14530), and dehydratase TpcK (AFUA_4G14470)48–50, were at least threefold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains than in clinical isolates. Arp1 (AFUA_2G17580), a scytalone dehydratase involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis51–53 was threefold more abundant, whereas Asp-hemolysin (Asp-HS; AFUA_3G00590)54 was eight times more abundant in ISS strains.

Examination of the production yields of monomethylsulochrin, the final intermediate in trypacidin biosynthesis, (trypacidin is not detectable until 7–8 days of growth50) showed ~600% and ~200% increased production in ISSFT-021 ad IF1SW-F4, respectively (Figure S-2). Additionally, proteome of clinical and ISS strains was examined in liquid CD and PD media and confirmed significant up-regulation of AspHS (Table S-4). Lastly, observed differences in sporulation capacity between the strains do not seem to be directly correlated with conidiaassociated protein expression levels (Figure S-3), suggesting that the observed variations are due to exposure to space environment rather than different growth rates.3.3. Stress response. Among proteins with altered abundance, 11 were involved in the stress response of A. fumigatus (Table 2). AFUA_5G11430, a quinone oxidoreductase, and Pst2 (AFUA_1G02820), an NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, involved in oxidative stress response were three and four times more abundant in space strains. Erythromycin esterase, AFUA_1G05850, and 3’ exoribonuclease AFUA_2G1598056 were at least twofold more abundant in ISS strains. Among proteins with decreased abundance several were heat shock proteins including Scf1 (AFUA_1G17370)57,58, and Awh11 (AFUA_6G12450)56. Other down-regulated protein was dehydrin-like protein DprA (AFUA_4G00860) that is known to play a role in oxidative stress response59. Table 2.

Carbohydrate metabolic processes. Comparative analysis of proteomes of ISS-isolated strains, IF1SW-F4 and ISST-021, with clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293 revealed changes in abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (Table 3). Pyruvate decarboxylase PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), which catalyzes the first step in anaerobic conversion of pyruvate to ethanol60, was about three times more abundant in space strains when compared to clinical isolates. Proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, including glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730), and glycerol kinase AFUA_4G1154055 were at least 2.5-fold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains. AFUA_5G10540 and AFUA_1G02140, which are homologues of A. niger An14g04190 and GdbA (An01g06120)61, respectively, and involved in glycogen biosynthesis and metabolism were at least twofold more abundant. Protein abundance of AFUA_3G08470, AFUA_4G08880, AFUA_7G_01830, and AFUA_1G14710 involved in glucose metabolism, increased twofold at minimum. Both, the 14–3-3 family protein ArtA (AFUA_2G03290)62 and malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540)63 were threefold more abundant when compared to clinical isolates. At minimum twofold increased abundance of phosphoketolase (AFUA_3G00370) and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910)64 was observed. Among the decreased in abundance proteins were hydrolase Exg17 (AFUA_6G14490)65 and β−1,3-glucan modifying enzyme Sun1 (AFUA_7G05450)66. Table 3.

DISCUSSION The proteome of A. fumigatus has been studied under various conditions, including short-67, and long-term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58. However, in this report we present unique proteome differences observed in the two ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates. To date, there is no report which elucidates the molecular response of filamentous fungi to the distinct environment of the ISS, despite previous reports of their presence on board of the ISS22 and Mir27,71. In-depth understanding of alterations triggered in the proteome of omnipresent A. fumigatus remains imperative for astronauts’ health, as it is an opportunistic pathogen that affects individuals with impaired immune system functions41. Both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains displayed higher abundance of several proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthesis. Trypacidin is a potent mycotoxin produced by A. fumigatus conidia. It has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against A549 alveolar lung cells suggesting its importance during the infection76. Further, it has been reported that A. fumigatus conidia with disrupted production of trypacidin exhibit higher susceptibility to macrophage clearance49. Increased abundance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of trypacidin in both ISS–isolated strains may be possible cause of the reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates45. Moreover, emodin and questin, precursors of trypacidin, are pigmented anthraquinones that have been reported to have a protective effect against UV in other organisms (Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica) that produce these types of compounds50,77. It is therefore reasonable to assume that up-regulation of trypacidin production may be another adaptation to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, however this hypothesis has to be validated by further experiments. Further, the level of Asp-HS, which is a known toxin produced by A. fumigatus54,78 was highly increased in both ISS-isolates. While several studies have reported its hemolytic79 and cytotoxic80,81 activities in the past, a recent report showed lack of attenuated virulence when Asp-HS gene was deleted82. This discrepancy may be strain specific as the studies used different A. fumigatus strains to carry out the experiments or related to experimental models used in both studies, as at times results observed for in vitro analyses do not correlated with the outcomes observed in in vivo studies. The exact role of Asp-HS in the pathogenicity remains to be determined during future studies. Nonetheless, increased abundance of Asp-HS observed in both ISS-isolated strains appears to be a part of the A. fumigatus adaptation response to the unique ISS environment. One of the increased in abundance proteins in ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was Arp1, which is one of the six enzymes involved in the DHN-melanin production51–53. Arp1 disruption resulted in production of reddish pink conidia with induced C3 binding that led to phagocytosis and killing of conidial spores during infection51,52. Increased abundance of Arp1 protein may, therefore, be another cause of the previously reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model45. Additionally, higher AlbA abundance, involved in DHN-melanin production72, was observed in JSC-093350089 A. niger isolated from the ISS73. Seemingly, both ISS-isolated species, A. fumigatus and A. niger, responded with increased melanin production to enhanced irradiation on board of the ISS. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of increased melanin production in fungi isolated from high-radiation environments such as the Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites or “Evolution Canyon”74,75. However, because none of the other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis showed increased abundance when compared to both clinical isolates simultaneously, further assessment of melanin production is necessary to definitively conclude its increased production under ISS conditions. Proteome analysis of both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains revealed altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress response. ArtA, a regulatory protein, was reported to be increased in abundance in response to incubation with H2O2, suggesting its importance in overcoming oxidative stress62. Pst2, which is also present in Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was shown to be induced in response to oxidative stress83,84. Additionally, Pst2 was reported to be a post-translational modification target protein that is ubiquitinated under peroxide stress conditions in C. albicans85. Interestingly, such post-translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage86. These data are in agreement with previous reports of induced oxidative stress response in humans, mice and yeast while in space87–91. Overall, increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was also observed in Acinetobacter sp. Ver3 when exposed to UV irradiation92 and JSC-093350089 A. niger73. Although increased abundance of several oxidative stress-correlated proteins was observed in this study, it was previously reported that ISS-isolated strains were more resistant than Af293 to H2O2 exposure, but less resistant than CEA10, suggesting no adaptation45. Among the more abundant proteins in both ISS-isolated strains several were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540) is one of the three key enzymes involved in glyoxylate cycle63, which has been shown to be crucial for fungal growth on C2 compounds and fatty acids as a sole carbon source93. In our earlier study it was documented that these two ISS-isolated strains significantly outgrew both clinical isolates45. Further, more abundant PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), a pyruvate decarboxylase, has been shown to be involved in ethanol fermentation60. These data therefore suggest possible adaptation of A. fumigatus to low-nutrient environment of the ISS20,22, which is in agreement with changes observed in proteome of A. fumigatus during starvation94. Similarly, up-regulation of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in ISS-isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger73. This study presents comparative proteomic analysis of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinically established isolates Af293 and CEA10. Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report that focused on studying the proteomic changes in filamentous fungus isolated from on board of the ISS. Complex analyses of possible molecular alterations triggered by microgravity and enhanced irradiation will be pertinent to the future long-term manned space flights, as such an understanding is crucial for astronauts’ health and biodeterioration of the closed habitat.
