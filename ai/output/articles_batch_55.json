The WGS will allow for detailed genomic characterization to determine the possible applications and importance for space and biotechnological industries.ANNOUNCEMENT During an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), 30 strains representing seven species belonging to the Penicillium (n = 5) and Aspergillus (n = 2) genera were isolated (1), and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The Penicillium genus encompasses more than 350 species found worldwide in soil, vegetation, air, indoor environments, and food (2). Aspergillus species are saprophytes found in a variety of environmental niches; however, some of them are also opportunistic human pathogens (3, 4). Members of the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera are of economic and industrial importance, including Penicillium chrysogenum, which is used to produce β-lactam antibiotics (5), Penicillium camemberti, which is used for maturation of soft cheeses such as Camembert, Brie, and Neufchatel (6), and Aspergillus niger, which is a known producer of citric acid (7, 8). Recently, Penicillium polonicum has been shown to tolerate and effectively remove lead (Pb) from polluted water, indicating a promising solution for new remediation strategies to purify contaminated water (9). Lastly, Aspergillus unguis, Penicillium dipodomyicola, and Penicillium griseoroseum have been reported to produce novel bioactive compounds (10–13). Considering existing and yet-to-be uncovered, versatile applications of Penicillium and Aspergillus species, characterization of WGS of these fungi is critical. Additionally, since fungi are excellent models for studying evolution and adaptation, due to their experimental features (14), the ISS-isolated species are of unique significance for investigating how microgravity and irradiation affect them when compared to their ground counterparts. The procedure for collecting samples and performing consecutive processing steps has been described elsewhere (1). Briefly, surface samples were collected with premoistened polyester wipes and then resuspended in 200 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with vigorous shaking. The extracted samples were concentrated using InnovaPrep (Drexel, MO) CP-150 concentrating pipettes. Aliquots (100 μl) of each sample were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. A single colony was picked, restreaked onto PDA, and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. About 1 μg of biomass grown overnight was collected and used for DNA extraction with the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit (Zymo Corp., Irvine, CA). To acquire the WGS, shotgun libraries were prepared following the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol (15), and paired-end sequencing of 30 strains was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. The quality of the raw reads obtained was confirmed with FastQC (v0.11.7) (16). Assessment of the quality filtering steps and adapter removal were performed using fastp (v0.20.0) (17). The cleaned sequences were assembled with SPAdes using the automatic coverage cutoff value (v3.11.1) (18). Assembly quality, number of contigs, N50 values, and genome size were calculated using QUAST (v5.0.2). Default parameters were used for all software. The species were identified based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), calmodulin, and β-tubulin sequences extracted from the assembled genomes. The details of the final assemblies and phylogenetic identification are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation. Keywords: climate change, evolutionary processes, genetic diversity, host–parasite interactions, MHC",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction We are facing a severe biodiversity crisis attributable to human activities (Allentoft and O'Brien 2010). Habitat loss and climate change are leading to population declines, loss of genetic diversity and increased extinction risk. Genetic diversity is considered one of the vital pillars of biodiversity and is essential for the capacity of a population to adapt to new environments (Alberto et al. 2013; Frankham 2010; Pauls et al. 2013). The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have garnered wide interest for their role in parasite recognition and immune defense at the individual and population level (Sommer 2005). The MHC is typically highly polymorphic, but genetic erosion of the MHC may severely compromise a population's capacity to adapt to changing parasitic environments or the emergence of novel parasites. In this review, we summarize the key features of the MHC and discuss the dynamics influencing MHC diversity across spatial and temporal scales. We also explore these dynamics in the context of future climate change. Finally, we present how to integrate immunogenetic, environmental, and parasite data across taxa to test hypotheses and uncover the spatial and temporal patterns. Understanding overarching geographical and long‐term temporal patterns has exceptional merit for conservation biology, informing appropriate actions to limit parasite spread within and across populations (Ekroth et al. 2021; Langwig et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2009). 1.1. MHC Diversity and the Processes Maintaining Variation MHC is a multi‐gene family found in all jawed vertebrates, which is considered the most variable set of genes in the genome (Hood et al. 1983; Hughes 2002; Kaufman et al. 1985; Klein 1975; Rock et al. 2016). The MHC plays a crucial role in parasite recognition and activation of the immune response. Each MHC class I and II protein binds to a specific set of peptides, with distinct MHC proteins recognizing and interacting with different antigenic peptides (Kaufman et al. 1985). The high genetic diversity in the MHC region is concentrated in the domains that encode antigen‐binding sites of the classical MHC class I and class II molecules (Klein 1975). MHC class I is predominately expressed on nucleated cells and is involved in the surveillance of intracellular parasites, such as viruses. MHC class II is expressed on specialized immune cells, such as B‐cells and dendritic cells, and is thus involved in the surveillance of extracellular parasites, such as bacteria and macro‐parasites (Klein 1979). The high variation in MHC molecules is directly linked to their ability to bind a wide array of antigens from various pathogens—viruses, bacteria, and macro‐parasites—thereby enhancing recognition by the host immune system (Kaufman et al. 1985). MHC diversity is further amplified by copy number variation within species, such that multiple gene copies can be found across individuals (Minias 2024). This variation expands the repertoire of antigen presentation and parasite recognition of individuals (Bentkowski and Radwan 2019). It also creates a challenge, however, to accurately characterize MHC diversity by for example, amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing by short‐read sequencing technologies, as sequences cannot be assigned to specific MHC loci (Babik 2010; Lighten et al. 2014; Peel et al. 2022). Many studies on MHC diversity focus on the specific exon or exons involved in peptide binding and analyze MHC genotypes, supertypes, or heterozygosity in the context of for example, molecular evolution, population genetics, conservation biology, disease associations, and mate choice (reviewed in Cheng et al. 2022). MHC diversity in the context of infection resistance has been studied in amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals (Kosch et al. 2022; Nash and Ryan 2023; Savage and Zamudio 2011; Schmid et al. 2023; Vinkler et al. 2022). Host parasite resistance and fitness are closely related to the variability of MHC molecules (Vinkler et al. 2022). Sedge warblers ( Acrocephalus schoenobaenus ) with many MHC class I supertypes have higher resistance to avian malaria (Biedrzycka and Radwan 2008). Associations between specific MHC alleles and avian malaria prevalence have also been reported in other Passeriformes (Bonneaud et al. 2006; Westerdahl et al. 2005). In amphibians, specific MHC class II exon 2 haplotypes in common toads ( Bufo bufo ) are associated with individual survival rates to infection by the deadly chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The survival of infected toads was dependent on MHC haplotype configuration (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2022). Across multiple amphibian species, resistance to chytrid fungus has been linked to the MHC class II pocket‐9 conformation, based on experimental infections and field observations of chytrid‐associated population declines (Bataille et al. 2015). Parasite‐mediated balancing selection is the main evolutionary pressure maintaining genetic variation at the MHC across populations and between species, with the latter being referred to as trans‐species polymorphism (Charlesworth 2006; Hedrick 1998; Höglund 2009; Sommer 2005). Evidence of parasite‐mediated balancing selection has been found across host taxa, including amphibians (Trujillo et al. 2021), birds (He et al. 2021; Minias et al. 2021), fish (Herdegen‐Radwan et al. 2021), and mammals (Ebert and Fields 2020; Gonzalez 2021; Zhang et al. 2018). There are three non‐mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining the parasite‐mediated maintenance of MHC polymorphism, namely ‘Heterozygosity Advantage’, ‘Rare Allele Advantage’ (negative frequency‐dependent selection) and ‘Fluctuating Selection’ across landscapes or time (Gibson 2022; Spurgin and Richardson 2010). The ‘Heterozygosity Advantage’ hypothesis posits that heterozygous individuals can recognize a larger variety of antigens than homozygous individuals, conferring greater resistance to infection in the former (Lo et al. 2021; Savage et al. 2011). Additionally, individuals with more divergent MHC alleles have been hypothesized to bind and recognize a wider array of antigens, further increasing parasite resistance (Divergent Allele Advantage) (Lau et al. 2015; Lenz et al. 2009; Wakeland et al. 1990). The ‘Rare Allele Advantage’ hypothesis predicts that a rare or novel allele in a population will confer greater disease resistance, as there is strong selection on parasites from common MHC alleles to overcome resistance (also Bolnick and Stutz 2017; Bourgeois et al. 2021; Takahata and Nei 1990). For example, Trinidadian guppies carrying novel MHC alleles and MHC supertypes experience a 37% reduction in infection intensity of the ectoparasite, Gyrodactylus turnbulli (Phillips et al. 2018). Rare allele advantage may also favor old, rare alleles, resulting in a cyclical, co‐evolutionary dynamic in which MHC alleles fluctuate in frequency over time, maintaining diversity (Slade 1992). Finally, the ‘Fluctuating Selection’ hypothesis states that spatial and temporal variation in parasite prevalence, diversity and infection intensity generates a heterogenous selective environment, leading to different MHC alleles being favored at different times and/or different places. Overall, this heterogeneity will maintain MHC diversity in host meta‐populations (Hedrick 2002; Spurgin and Richardson 2010). Parasite‐mediated selection under ‘Fluctuating Selection’ on the MHC is thus directional, but also variable due to changes in biotic or abiotic environment, as well as chance dispersal and extinction events. Determining the relative roles of these modes of selection is a challenge, as they are not mutually exclusive. All three modes may act to shape overall MHC diversity (Spurgin and Richardson 2010). For example, a role for fluctuating selection has been reported in several species (Osborne et al. 2017; Teacher et al. 2009; Trujillo et al. 2021), and occasionally in combination with either divergent allele advantage (Osborne et al. 2017) or negative frequency‐dependent selection (Teacher et al. 2009; Trujillo et al. 2021). Additionally, geographical variation in modes of selection has been observed, for example in moor frogs ( Rana arvalis ). In this species, MHC class II variation was found to decrease in northern populations due to directional selection, and variation was maintained at southern latitudes due to divergent and/or balancing selection (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2018). MHC diversity can also be shaped by other selective and neutral forces (Wakelin and Apanius 1997). Genetic drift resulting from demographic processes (i.e., post‐glacial recolonization, migration) impacts genetic variation genome‐wide, and has been shown to affect MHC diversity in fragmented and small populations, or at the edge of species distributions (Belasen et al. 2022, 2019; Herdegen et al. 2014; Höglund et al. 2022). MHC‐based mate choice (disassortative mating) may also help to maintain MHC diversity in excess of what is expected under parasite‐mediated selection alone (Ejsmond and Radwan 2015). It has been argued that the combined effects of natural and sexual selection on MHC variants explain how diverse communities of hosts and parasites can be maintained over evolutionary time. That is, even in the face of strong frequency‐dependent selection favoring particular MHC genotypes (Milinski 2006). Models combining the effects of natural selection and MHC‐based disassortative mating in small populations have indicated that while parasite‐mediated selection can accelerate loss of MHC diversity, the stabilizing effects of sexual selection can moderate major fluctuations in allele frequencies and protect functional variants against drift (Jan Ejsmond et al. 2014). Appropriately, the interaction between multiple evolutionary forces contributes to shaping and potentially maintaining important genetic variation in at‐risk populations. Critically, understanding how eco‐evolutionary processes (neutral vs. adaptive) shape genetic variation in wildlife populations is a key challenge. Expanding our study systems to encompass spatial and temporal patterns shows potential to help disentangle the evolutionary dynamics underlying these processes.",

Ongoing research of parasite‐driven selective processes under natural conditions should focus on characterizing MHC genetic variation at complete class I and II loci from well‐assembled and well‐annotated genomes and transcriptomes. In addition, changes in adaptive versus neutral marker allele frequencies over time should contribute to understanding the relative contribution of drift, selection, and parasite‐mediated selection mechanisms in shaping patterns of functional diversity. To estimate allele frequencies by using candidate and neutral markers, we must consider broad spatial and temporal scales across vertebrates as a whole. Furthermore, changes in allele frequency could be significant in habitats susceptible to sudden climatic events or the arrival of new parasites. These advances will only be possible by improving the accessibility of centralized public and multidisciplinary large data sets to increase our integrative knowledge on the importance of adaptive genetic variability in wild animals. Wildlife conservation efforts that monitor MHC genetic diversity across space and time—at the edges of species distributions, in long‐term fragmented habitats, or at northern latitudes—will be most effective for ensuring long‐term species preservation in the face of climate change and emerging diseases.",

Copyright notice ID: 12034939 PMID: 40297318 ABSTRACT Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation. Keywords: climate change, evolutionary processes, genetic diversity, host–parasite interactions, MHC The article discusses the importance of genetic diversity, particularly in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) loci, in maintaining evolution and protecting against infectious disease. We review the emerging research on geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in natural populations and highlight the consequences of lower MHC diversity in certain situations, such as at the edge of species distributions or in the face of emerging pathogens. We propose further genomic approaches to comprehensively measure changes in MHC diversity and parasitism in the wild. 1. Introduction We are facing a severe biodiversity crisis attributable to human activities (Allentoft and O'Brien 2010). Habitat loss and climate change are leading to population declines, loss of genetic diversity and increased extinction risk. Genetic diversity is considered one of the vital pillars of biodiversity and is essential for the capacity of a population to adapt to new environments (Alberto et al. 2013; Frankham 2010; Pauls et al. 2013). The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have garnered wide interest for their role in parasite recognition and immune defense at the individual and population level (Sommer 2005). The MHC is typically highly polymorphic, but genetic erosion of the MHC may severely compromise a population's capacity to adapt to changing parasitic environments or the emergence of novel parasites. In this review, we summarize the key features of the MHC and discuss the dynamics influencing MHC diversity across spatial and temporal scales. We also explore these dynamics in the context of future climate change. Finally, we present how to integrate immunogenetic, environmental, and parasite data across taxa to test hypotheses and uncover the spatial and temporal patterns. Understanding overarching geographical and long‐term temporal patterns has exceptional merit for conservation biology, informing appropriate actions to limit parasite spread within and across populations (Ekroth et al. 2021; Langwig et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2009). 1.1. MHC Diversity and the Processes Maintaining Variation MHC is a multi‐gene family found in all jawed vertebrates, which is considered the most variable set of genes in the genome (Hood et al. 1983; Hughes 2002; Kaufman et al. 1985; Klein 1975; Rock et al. 2016). The MHC plays a crucial role in parasite recognition and activation of the immune response. Each MHC class I and II protein binds to a specific set of peptides, with distinct MHC proteins recognizing and interacting with different antigenic peptides (Kaufman et al. 1985). The high genetic diversity in the MHC region is concentrated in the domains that encode antigen‐binding sites of the classical MHC class I and class II molecules (Klein 1975). MHC class I is predominately expressed on nucleated cells and is involved in the surveillance of intracellular parasites, such as viruses. MHC class II is expressed on specialized immune cells, such as B‐cells and dendritic cells, and is thus involved in the surveillance of extracellular parasites, such as bacteria and macro‐parasites (Klein 1979). The high variation in MHC molecules is directly linked to their ability to bind a wide array of antigens from various pathogens—viruses, bacteria, and macro‐parasites—thereby enhancing recognition by the host immune system (Kaufman et al. 1985). MHC diversity is further amplified by copy number variation within species, such that multiple gene copies can be found across individuals (Minias 2024). This variation expands the repertoire of antigen presentation and parasite recognition of individuals (Bentkowski and Radwan 2019). It also creates a challenge, however, to accurately characterize MHC diversity by for example, amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing by short‐read sequencing technologies, as sequences cannot be assigned to specific MHC loci (Babik 2010; Lighten et al. 2014; Peel et al. 2022). Many studies on MHC diversity focus on the specific exon or exons involved in peptide binding and analyze MHC genotypes, supertypes, or heterozygosity in the context of for example, molecular evolution, population genetics, conservation biology, disease associations, and mate choice (reviewed in Cheng et al. 2022). MHC diversity in the context of infection resistance has been studied in amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals (Kosch et al. 2022; Nash and Ryan 2023; Savage and Zamudio 2011; Schmid et al. 2023; Vinkler et al. 2022). Host parasite resistance and fitness are closely related to the variability of MHC molecules (Vinkler et al. 2022). Sedge warblers ( Acrocephalus schoenobaenus ) with many MHC class I supertypes have higher resistance to avian malaria (Biedrzycka and Radwan 2008). Associations between specific MHC alleles and avian malaria prevalence have also been reported in other Passeriformes (Bonneaud et al. 2006; Westerdahl et al. 2005).

Critically, understanding how eco‐evolutionary processes (neutral vs. adaptive) shape genetic variation in wildlife populations is a key challenge. Expanding our study systems to encompass spatial and temporal patterns shows potential to help disentangle the evolutionary dynamics underlying these processes.2. Patterns Across Time and Space 2.1. Geographical Effects: Latitudinal and Altitudinal Effects The genetic diversity of a host species, as well as general species diversity, can vary along a gradient (Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. 2017; Daco et al. 2022; Yiming et al. 2021). Both host immune genetic variation and parasite biodiversity tend to be lower at higher latitudes (Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. 2017; O'Connor et al. 2018; Preisser 2019; Stevens 2006). This pattern has been documented from unicellular to multicellular organisms in concordance with the ‘Latitudinal Diversity Gradient Trend’ hypothesis (Miraldo et al. 2016; Preisser 2019; Figure 1). This hypothesis remains relatively untested within individual hosts in relation to parasites (Johnson and Haas 2021). Diversity does, however, tend to increase from the poles to the equator (Adams and Hadly 2013; Pianka 1989). The ‘Latitudinal Diversity Gradient Trend’ hypothesis predicts steeper patterns (e.g., clear isolation by distance) in large‐scale gradients (> 1000 km) of latitudinal diversity compared to more localized gradients. Evolutionary mechanisms such as drift, selection, and/or demographic processes (e.g., postglacial colonization events) also contribute to genetic variation distribution around the globe (Cook et al. 2022; Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. 2017; Thörn et al. 2021). Across taxa, genetic variation at MHC molecules can decrease with increasing latitude (e.g., wild ungulates; (Mainguy et al. 2007) mouse; (André et al. 2017) or fish (Dionne et al. 2007)). A similar latitudinal pattern of decreasing MHC genetic variation has been found over the Scandinavian Peninsula in different amphibian species ( Rana arvalis ; (Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. 2017), Bufo bufo ; (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2019) and Bufotes viridis ; (Höglund et al. 2022)). In mountain goats from southwest China, MHC variation has been shown to decrease with increasing altitude (Huang et al. 2015). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab The distribution of genetic variation of a hypothetical species according to the (A) central‐marginal theory (green distribution) and (B) latitudinal diversity gradient trend hypothesis (orange). The black arrows indicate the direction of increased genetic variation.Gradients of genetic variation could also be shaped by the Central‐Marginal Theory (Eckert et al. 2008) (Figure 1). This theory predicts that genetic diversity is highest at the center of a species distribution, which decreases outwards toward the margins (Eckert et al. 2008; Guo 2012; Thörn et al. 2021). Species range expansion often originates from the core of a species' distribution, where the habitat is optimal for its persistence (e.g., glacial refugia) and progresses toward peripheral regions. Throughout this process, new populations are established through successive population bottlenecks (Singhal et al. 2022). Populations at range margins tend to be smaller and more spatially isolated, becoming subjected to genetic drift and gene flow from the range center. This dynamic often leads to reduced genetic diversity along the expanding range edge, increased population structure, and allele frequency clines centered on the origin of expansion (Peter and Slatkin 2013). For instance, Langin et al. (2017) demonstrated that genetic variation decreased at the range edge of an island scrub‐jay population, with homozygosity increasing toward the island periphery.2.2. Habitat Fragmentation Long‐term habitat loss and fragmentation, directly caused by human activity, are considered to be significant and widespread drivers of biodiversity loss (Lino et al. 2019). Substantial decreases in population size and species richness as a result may lead to a loss of genetic and immunogenetic diversity (Belasen et al. 2019; Gibbs 2001). The loss of genetic diversity over time due to genetic drift and purifying selection in small populations, together with increased levels of inbreeding, will have serious consequences for disease susceptibility (Zuidema et al. 1996). Habitat fragmentation has resulted in loss of genome‐wide variation as well as MHC diversity in African and Asiatic Cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus spp) due to genetic drift and inbreeding (Castro‐Prieto et al. 2011; Prost et al. 2022) Similarly, African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus ) in South Africa have lost genomic variation over decades with a parallel decrease of the MHC (Meiring et al. 2022). It has alternatively been shown that immunogenetic variation could be maintained even in populations that experienced loss of genome‐wide diversity by selective processes such as balancing selection (Oliver and Piertney 2012). Functional diversity may therefore be maintained to some extent even in highly fragmented populations (Ciborowski et al. 2017; Escoda and Castresana 2021). Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between genome‐wide diversity and adaptive gene variation in endangered species living in severely fragmented habitats remains poorly understood. Fragmented populations with high inbreeding levels may evolve differently depending on whether they are resistant or susceptible to endemic parasites. “Resistant fragmented populations” appear when the contact interaction between hosts infected by the same parasite are limited within a population (Belasen et al. 2019). The reduced contact interaction between hosts will minimize parasite transmission between hosts and an increase of resistant MHC alleles might be generated after directional selection from local parasites (Belasen et al. 2019; Pearson et al. 2009). Conversely, “Susceptible fragmented populations” emerge when genetically eroded hosts within a population exhibits a high frequency of MHC alleles that are susceptible to infection, implying strong directional selection on susceptible MHC alleles to local parasites (Belasen et al. 2019; Pearson et al. 2009). Ideally, natural selection would eliminate these susceptible alleles. Other factors, such as co‐infection, may disrupt this process, leading to an increase in susceptible alleles (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2023). The last scenario has been demonstrated in both lab and natural population studies (Ellison et al. 2012, 2011). For example, Ellison et al. (2012) found that both MHC and neutral genetic variation were lost after several generations of selfing in the self‐fertilizing fish Kryptolebias marmoratus under experimental conditions. Interestingly, the loss of MHC variation appeared non‐random, suggesting that parasite‐mediated directional selection may favor divergent MHC alleles (Ellison et al. 2012). In general, long‐term fragmentation may negatively affect MHC diversity and geographic distribution, particularly in isolated populations at the edges of species ranges or in habitats severely altered by human activities. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are expected to also influence parasite prevalence (Perrin et al. 2023). The relationship between anthropogenic disturbances and wildlife disease prevalence is highly variable, with parasite‐mediated selection pressures differing across environments due to variations in parasite ecology, transmission dynamics, and host immune responses (Brearley et al. 2013; Young et al. 2013). Few studies have investigated neutral diversity, MHC diversity, and parasite interactions in disturbed landscapes. In ornate dragon lizards ( Ctenophorus ornatus ), individuals showed significant variation in the number of MHC class I alleles. A positive association was found between the average number of MHC class I alleles and tick load in undisturbed reserve populations, but this relationship was not observed in populations from disturbed agricultural areas (Radwan et al. 2014). The observed lower tick load in disturbed landscapes could be the result of weaker population connectivity or a low number of alternative hosts preventing tick transmission. Low transmission would weaken parasite‐mediated selection for MHC variation in these populations (Radwan et al. 2014). Additionally, variation in parasite‐specific selection pressures was also observed in the Tome's spiny rat ( Proechimys semispinosus ), a generalist rodent that inhabits both natural and human‐disturbed landscapes (Fleischer et al. 2024). This study compared neutral genetic diversity, MHC diversity, and parasite prevalence/diversity across landscapes with varying levels of human disturbance, while also considering habitat features that define distinct habitats, as demonstrated in the study by Schwensow et al. (2022). Fleischer et al. (2024) found lower genome‐wide and MHC diversity as well as lower nematode and virus infection rates in forest fragments relative to protected, continuous forests. Associations between MHC alleles and supertypes varied across these landscapes, with most appearing in the continuous forests or protected forest islands (Fleischer et al. 2024). Associations were occasionally in opposite directions, for example, individuals with the MHC class II allele Prse‐DRB*006 were more often infected with Picobirnavirus in forest fragments, whereas this same allele was associated with reduced infections by Picobirnavirus in protected forests (Fleischer et al. 2024). This study highlights the impact of landscape disturbance on host–parasite interactions and coevolution. Disturbance can lead to altered parasite‐mediated selection and even altered resistance of MHC alleles due to environmental interactions or stressors or other genetic effects.2.3. Temporal Effects Spatio‐temporal studies generally reveal fluctuations in parasite‐mediated selection and, as a consequence, in associations between MHC diversity and parasites (Piertney and Oliver 2006; Sommer 2005). Long‐term studies are limited. Spatiotemporal studies generally reveal fluctuations in associations between MHC diversity and parasites, as well as the relative evolutionary and selective forces. For instance, the fluctuating selection mechanism was observed in water voles ( Arvicola terrestris ); three populations studied over 6 years showed that within‐population, between‐year differentiation for MHC loci was significantly correlated with microsatellites, implying the influence of neutral forces such as migration and drift were shaping temporal changes in MHC diversity (Oliver et al. 2009). Across populations, however, genetic differentiation implied that MHC variation was primarily affected by directional selection and drift, potentially reflecting fluctuating selection (Oliver et al. 2009). Fluctuating selection and rare allele advantage mechanisms were observed in bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ). A study of three populations over 11 years revealed that different MHC supertypes were associated with reduced prevalence and abundance of the same helminth across sub‐populations (Migalska et al. 2022). Temporal patterns revealed potential parasite adaptations to common MHC supertypes. Helminth species that have recently colonized or spread in a given subpopulation were more frequently infecting voles with MHC supertypes common in the recent past (Migalska et al. 2022). Additionally, rare‐allele advantage was observed in the feral population of Soay sheep ( Ovis aries ) over 20 years of monitoring. The study showed that MHC haplotype D increased overall fitness in males, and this initially rare haplotype underwent directional selection across successive seasons (Huang et al. 2022). Finally, a recent study spanning 21 years of immunogenetic and disease data in a population of meerkats ( Suricata suricatta ) revealed strong evidence for rare allele advantage (Mueller‐Klein et al. 2024). In general, MHC allele frequencies fluctuated over time, but specifically, the MHC class II allele Susu‐DRB*13 showed a temporal increase in resistance to tuberculosis with an associated increase in frequency in the population (Mueller‐Klein et al. 2024).3. Abrupt Climatic Changes Climate change projections estimate that global warming will reach 3.2°C by 2100 under current climate policies, with significant impacts already observed on weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe (Carlson et al. 2022) Warmer temperatures may facilitate the introduction of parasites into new habitats through their vectors (Brooks and Boeger 2019; Epstein 2001; Williams et al. 2002), posing a significant threat to global wildlife health. Indeed, predictions from mammal‐virus models show that range shifts under climate change will significantly increase cross‐species transmission of viruses as species track thermal optima and aggregate at higher elevations (Carlson et al. 2022). In livestock, changes in temperature may alter the geographical ranges of disease vectors, with some expanding (e.g., Culicoides imicola) and others contracting (e.g., tsetse flies) (Bett et al. 2017). Also, extreme weather events like droughts and El Niño patterns have been associated with outbreaks of diseases such as Rift Valley fever (Bett et al. 2017). In amphibians, rising temperatures have been linked to increased outbreaks of chytrid fungus (Bd), contributing to widespread amphibian declines globally (Rollins‐Smith 2017, 2020; Scheele et al. 2019). Heat waves, cold snaps, droughts, heavy rainfall, and tropical cyclones are expected to become more frequent and unpredictable under climate change, which poses a significant challenge for organisms to adapt to these unstable conditions (Smale and Wernberg 2013). Extreme climate events are likely to disrupt physiological, metabolic, respiratory, reproductive, and immunological competence in hosts and intensify the costs of parasitism (Martinez and Merino 2011). While warmer temperatures can strengthen physical barriers to infection, they may also decrease cellular immune responses by modulating both innate and acquired immunity (Scharsack and Franke 2022; Sun et al. 2023). Host–parasite interactions are impacted by environmental stress, shaping selection on immune genes (Poulin et al. 2024; Wolinska and King 2009). Cold‐adapted species such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), whose immune system functions optimally at 7°C, exhibit severe immunosuppression when exposed to 14°C under experimental infection with the parasite Loma morhua, as well as various fungi and bacteria, resulting in 48% mortality (Scharsack and Franke 2022). These findings suggest that cold‐adapted teleosts, such as the Atlantic cod, are highly susceptible to rising temperatures and more vulnerable to infections as temperatures increase (Scharsack and Franke 2022). Likewise, a mass mortality event during the 2003 European heat wave of experimentally reared three‐spined stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) revealed a strong family effect of parasite load, and those individuals with high parasite load suffered greater mortality (Wegner et al. 2008). In the survivors, researchers were able to detect that within families, an intermediate number of MHC class IIB variants increased survival, but these effects were small compared to between‐family effects, implying the importance of other contributing loci or non‐genetic interactions (Wegner et al. 2008). A study on domestic sheep populations showed that climate warming is expected to intensify infection pressure from gastrointestinal nematodes, driven by shifts in selection pressures within populations (Hayward et al. 2022). High parasite burdens were linked to reduced winter survival, emphasizing the role of strong selection in favoring individuals with more effective immune responses and lower parasite loads (Hayward et al. 2022). These studies highlight the substantial cost of parasitism to hosts during extreme weather and climatic events and the immunogenetic links to survivorship, which result in strong selection of resistance genotypes. An intensified period of warmer temperatures and extreme climatic events poses a significant challenge for organisms to track the trajectory of evolutionary processes over time. In the central range of a species' distribution and at mid‐latitudes globally, climate change‐driven range expansions may facilitate increased pathogen transmission due to greater taxonomic diversity and higher host contact rates. (Carlson et al. 2022). Genetic diversity in these populations are often high (Guo 2012) and thus standing immunogenetic variation may be available for populations adapt to novel parasites, even in the face of climatic fluctuations. If these species experience population declines and fragmentations due to climate change; however, they are susceptible to loss of immunogenetic diversity. This would increase their risk from increased disease transmission. Populations with limited genetic diversity, such as those at the edges of a species' distribution, may experience heightened susceptibility to parasites under changing environmental conditions, with limited potential for adaptive response. Assuming that parasite distribution is not constant over space at the edge of species distribution, the intensity of selection can vary in space, even at small spatial scales, leading to a more rapid adaptation if parasite pressure becomes significant (King and Lively 2009). Peripheral populations may be disproportionately affected by the anticipated spread of pathogens (Yadav and Upadhyay 2023), particularly vector‐borne pathogens, and subsequent population declines may further erode their genetic diversity. Small populations with limited genetic and immunogenetic diversity may lack the capacity to evolve resistance rapidly enough to match the rapid co‐evolutionary dynamics of pathogens, which have short generation times and large population sizes. Summarily, these complex interactions between various demographic and selective processes present a significant challenge to researchers to predict population susceptibility in the context of climate change and infectious disease. From a conservation perspective, maintenance (or supplementation) of genetic variation, particularly at the MHC and other immune genes, could be particularly important to facilitate rapid adaptation to emerging parasites or altered parasite communities under climate change.4. MHC Diversity in the Wild—Future Directions To disentangle evolutionary processes (e.g., drift, migration or selection) shaping adaptive genetic variation, the most applied method consists of contrasting spatial patterns of variation between adaptive genes and neutral markers (Babik et al. 2008; Belasen et al. 2019; Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. 2017; Santonastaso et al. 2017; Strand et al. 2012). When selection outweighs demographic processes, the level of differentiation in adapted genes between populations is lower under stabilizing selection, whereas differentiation should be higher under diversifying selection. This pattern suggests adaptation to local parasite faunas (Meyer‐Lucht et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2012). A lack of differentiation between adaptive and neutral markers would instead indicate a dominant role of drift, and demography might be a key contributor to functional diversity at a broad scale (see Cook et al. 2022; Rico et al. 2015, for specific examples). Disentangling the relative contributions of evolutionary forces and demographic events, and understanding how they influence genetic variation in natural populations in the face of infection, remains an unresolved issue. To identify and differentiate between specific selective processes and demographic processes shaping adaptive genetic variation, we propose the integration of specific multidisciplinary data (ecological factors, parasite diversity, changes in allele frequency estimation) to elucidate all potential processes and drivers that contribute to shaping adaptive genetic variation (Spurgin and Richardson 2010) (Box 1). BOX 1. Multidisciplinary data (including environmental factors, parasite prevalence data, and allele frequency data) that could help elucidate processes and drivers shaping MHC genetic variation in natural populations. (a) Environmental factors will give us a better understanding of the habitat characteristics where the organisms live in natural conditions, and will ultimately allow us to explore environmental changes as potential genetic diversity drivers in the nature (Florencio et al. 2014). As an example (Lee and Mitchell‐Olds 2011) estimate the quantitate contribution of environmental adaptation and IBD on genetic variation in Boechera stricta , from Arabidopsis genus. They found that the environment had a larger contribution than geography and confirmed the effect of environmental selection (e.g., climate, topography, and latitude) on genetic divergence between East and west lineages. Also, (O'Connor et al. 2020) showed a strong positive selection between precipitation and the number of different MHC‐I alleles. In general, there is a lack of knowledge on how changes in ecological factors over time could shape MHC genetic variation. Therefore, including ecological variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, topography, canopy cover and water temperature, pH, oxygen saturation when aquatic ecosystems are considered) are needed to better understand changes in functional adaptive genes, like MHC, in future climatic scenarios. (b) Parasite diversity, infection intensity and prevalence data. Novel associations between infection and MHC class II loci have been recently revealed (See for example; (Bataille et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2022; Savage et al. 2019)). Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. (2022) found that the presence of the MHC haplotype Bubu*09 has a negative impact on survival when common toad ( Bufo bufo ) individuals were infected with a specific chytrid fungus strain from Sweden. In parallel, haplotype Bubu*02 had a negative impact on survival infected with the UK‐strain, but was marginally beneficial when toads were infected by the Swedish‐strain. Despite the enormous effort on MHC characterization studies, and the association between specific MHC alleles with disease resistance, such associations are rarely investigated (e.g., Martin et al. (2022)). We propose that future studies focusing on MHC functional transcript wide polymorphism, and its comparison to the MHC‐DNA based polymorphism, to better understand how immunogenetics moderates disease in relation to parasite resistance. Finally, screening for infection intensity and parasite prevalence in relation to immune gene variation will be indispensable to investigating disease susceptibility wider patterns and their relation to specific MHC immune genes configuration in wildlife populations. (c) Allele frequency estimation. MHC characterization and allele frequency estimation over larger scales (e.g., > 1000 km; latitude/altitude, see Cortázar‐Chinarro et al. (2017), as an example) might explain spatial patterns of genetic diversity over space and time. While the estimation of long‐term changes in allele frequency parameters remains quite challenging, model‐based approaches (e.g., Wang (2022)) could facilitate the estimation of allele frequencies. For example, developing model‐based approaches could help predict allele frequency changes under different evolutionary pressures, parasite pressures, and/or under different climatic scenarios.There are limitations in current methodologies to characterize the MHC (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2023; Gaigher et al. 2016; Lighten et al. 2014), as well as statistical limitations (Gaigher et al. 2019), as an example. One limitation of current amplicon‐based approaches is the difficulty of understanding the underlying MHC genomic architecture. MHC class I and class II gene copies and organization vary widely across taxa. Multiple gene copies are generated by gene duplication and diversity is amplified by gene conversion (Gaigher et al. 2016). Primers designed to capture diversity at the peptide binding domains of MHC molecules often amplify multiple loci and may show amplification bias between loci. Sequenced MHC allelic variants cannot be reliably assigned to MHC loci (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al. 2023). Recent advancements in long‐read sequencing technologies (e.g., PacBio) have improved accuracy and reduced costs, providing researchers with valuable tools to better characterize the genetic architecture of the MHC in non‐model species (Dilthey 2021; Mellinger et al. 2023). These innovative technologies can be utilized by sequencing a subset of samples with long reads to lay the groundwork for MHC characterization, followed by population‐wide, amplicon‐based studies of MHC diversity or by MHC typing via long reads (Cheng et al. 2022). Capturing variation across the entire MHC gene complex could be achieved using a pangenomes approach, which involves high‐quality genomes to enable comparisons of these target immune genetic regions across organisms from different geographic areas (Chin et al. 2023). However, this approach currently entails significantly higher costs, and the availability of analytical pipelines for its implementation remains limited. Significant advancements have been made in eco‐immunology, enhancing our understanding of disease resistance and its relationship with immune defenses in wild animals. Most of these studies, however, focus on specific time points rather than offering temporally continuous and geographically diverse insights into host–parasite interactions. The lack of genomic data from many different species in relation to disease susceptibility or resistance is a challenge for addressing questions related to MHC characterization studies. This gap might be addressed by investing in public databases, giving the possibility of directly using genomic‐wide data generated previously into new research projects on genetic variation and infection. Such an approach would allow for working with large‐scale data and ensuring reproducibility. Standardized large data sets could be centralized and re‐used in future projects tackling the relationship between MHC diversity and parasitism (see Figure 2). Currently, large genomic data sets are already available from different international platforms such as  () or Ensembl genome browser. The potential integration of genomic data with other meta‐data (e.g., SILVA rRNA, parasitic organisms panels or climatic datasets) can be very complicated, despite the role for other factors in conferring resistance to infection (Ford and King 2016; Wolinska and King 2009). There is often a lack of consensus data in relation to genome version availability or file formats with the additional problem of expired links provided in publications. Using a single large, centralized dataset would make it easier to target complete genetic regions from well‐annotated genomes and transcriptomes. For example, it could easily target the MHC complex family genes or even a group of different immune regions within genomes of non‐model organisms. According to (Kosch et al. 2022), focusing on specific genetic regions alone may not provide a comprehensive vision of all immunogenetic effects and individual survival when carrying an infectious disease. Data science focused on extracting and applying the knowledge from typically large data sets would be optimal for immunogenetics, parasitic organisms and/or climate big data set integration to resolve these host–parasite evolutionary questions, particularly for wild systems. Data set integration would particularly help to answer the following questions: How can climate shape MHC allele frequencies across geographic and temporal scales? To what extent are changes in the allele frequencies of immune genes associated with host–parasite interactions and stochastic climatic events? What are the follow‐on fitness implications for patterns of infectious disease in the wild? FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Multidisciplinary data integration diagram. Single public universal dataset integration would include multi‐disciplinary (e.g., environmental, genomic resources, and host–parasite interactions) databases contributing to reproducibility and the recycling of data for new projects in the field of immunogenetics.5. Conclusions Investigating mechanisms that maintain genetic diversity will advance our understanding of local adaptive processes, particularly from infectious diseases. Ongoing research of parasite‐driven selective processes under natural conditions should focus on characterizing MHC genetic variation at complete class I and II loci from well‐assembled and well‐annotated genomes and transcriptomes. In addition, changes in adaptive versus neutral marker allele frequencies over time should contribute to understanding the relative contribution of drift, selection, and parasite‐mediated selection mechanisms in shaping patterns of functional diversity. To estimate allele frequencies by using candidate and neutral markers, we must consider broad spatial and temporal scales across vertebrates as a whole. Furthermore, changes in allele frequency could be significant in habitats susceptible to sudden climatic events or the arrival of new parasites. These advances will only be possible by improving the accessibility of centralized public and multidisciplinary large data sets to increase our integrative knowledge on the importance of adaptive genetic variability in wild animals. Wildlife conservation efforts that monitor MHC genetic diversity across space and time—at the edges of species distributions, in long‐term fragmented habitats, or at northern latitudes—will be most effective for ensuring long‐term species preservation in the face of climate change and emerging diseases.Author Contributions Maria Cortazar‐Chinarro: conceptualization (lead), funding acquisition (lead), investigation (lead), resources (lead), writing – original draft (lead).

    "abstract": "Abstract Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.

    "introduction": "Introduction Based on their nature as settlers in extreme environments, microbial extremophiles are of great interest to studies aiming to elucidate stress adaptation and survival mechanisms. Successful examples of extremophiles can be found in the fungal domain, alongside bacteria, and archaea, which for a long time were considered to be the sole colonizers of habitats previously considered uninhabitable. Some of these fungal extremophiles show even higher resistance than that of prokaryotes (Shtarkman et al., 2013; Aguilera and González-Toril, 2019). Black fungi in particular represent a group of highly melanized microfungi, whose ability to survive in a variety of extreme environments has in recent decades attracted increasing attention (Selbmann et al., 2005; Sterflinger, 2006; Gorbushina, 2007; Onofri et al., 2007). Desiccation, low nutrient availability, excessive radiation, extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH are some of the multiple sources of stress characterizing the habitats where these organisms have been shown to thrive (Gunde-Cimerman et al., 2000, 2003; Selbmann et al., 2008). The highest diversity of black fungi has especially been observed in rocky environments, ranging from mountain summits to the Atacama Desert and the Antarctic cold regions (Gonçalves et al., 2016; Ametrano et al., 2019). Rock represents a harsh habitat and a quite ancient niche for life, believed to reflect early Earth conditions, and thus considered to be a model for extraterrestrial life (Selbmann et al., 2014). The discovery of melanized fungi in extreme environments has prompted researchers to investigate microbial physiology at the absolute edges of adaptability, aiming at a deeper understanding of the limits for life (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; Tesei et al., 2012; Zakharova et al., 2013). Other studies have focused on testing fungal survival in space conditions through simulations in ground-based facilities or in space missions that enabled the assessment of the habitability of extraterrestrial environments and, hence, the possibility of life beyond Earth (Scalzi et al., 2012; Onofri et al., 2019). Space and outer space conditions are by definition hostile, as they include enhanced irradiation, microgravity, and temperature extremes (Rabbow et al., 2012, 2017; Senatore et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the isolation of melanized fungi from spacecraft and space stations—e.g., the International Space Station (ISS)—has been reported frequently (Checinska et al., 2015; Checinska-Sielaff et al., 2019). In this respect, a number of studies have examined the molecular adaptations of ISS-isolated strains to space conditions, showing alterations in metabolome and proteome (Knox et al., 2016; Blachowicz et al., 2019b; Romsdahl et al., 2019). Investigations of microbial survival in space are therefore relevant also in the context of space missions, to prevent contaminations and to develop strategies to reduce hazard, especially in the case of opportunistic species (Urbaniak et al., 2019). In black fungi, astrobiological studies have evaluated the potential effects of Mars or ISS conditions on fungal viability and metabolism. One investigation revealed that a rock isolate from Antarctica, Cryomyces minteri, could survive simulated Martian atmosphere and pressure, temperature fluctuations between −20 and 20°C, ultraviolet radiation, and vacuum (Onofri et al., 2008). Comparative 2D-PAGE proteomics was carried out for other rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) (i.e., Cryomyces antarcticus, Knufia perforans, and Exophiala jeanselmei) exposed to these conditions and showed a decrease in protein complexity, followed by recovery of the metabolic activity after 1 week of exposure (Zakharova et al., 2014). Further, survivability of C. antarcticus in outer space was shown via colony counts following a 1.5-year-long exposure on board the EXPOSE-E facility of the ISS (Onofri et al., 2012). A more recent experiment of C. antarcticus exposure on rock analogs under space and simulated Martian conditions revealed only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage and pointed out the high stability of DNA within melanized cells (Pacelli et al., 2016). In other investigations, the resistance to acute ionizing radiations was demonstrated in RIF (Pacelli et al., 2017, 2018). Together, these studies have revealed the ability of rock-colonizing black fungi to endure space conditions; however, to date, reports that specifically evaluate the response to microgravity have not been produced. Microgravity is an important factor influencing microbial life in space environments, a condition in which the gravity level is almost zero but not neutralized. Due to the technological and logistical hurdles linked to studies of microgravity in space, different methods have been developed to simulate microgravity and analyze microbial responses (Herranz et al., 2013). Accordingly, the term low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) is used to describe the environmental condition created by these devices, resembling the low-shear effects of the fluid on the cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2014). Spaceflight and ground-based microgravity analog experiments have suggested that microgravity can affect microbial gene expression, cell morphology, physiology, and metabolism, also triggering increased virulence in pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Altenburg et al., 2008; Taylor, 2015; Sathishkumar et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Although the effects of microgravity on microbes have been studied for several years, only the responses of a few typical prokaryotic and eukaryotic model organisms—e.g., Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp.—have hitherto been investigated (Huang et al., 2018). Hence, studying the reaction of black fungi to microgravity holds potential for the elucidation of the molecular basis of tolerance in extremotolerant and extremophilic fungi, and can also contribute to unearthing the biological uniqueness of these species and their adaptability to space conditions. In the present study, the qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to LSSMG was carried out for the first time. The rock-associated Knufia chersonesos (syn. Knufia petricola) was selected as the model organism due to its reported poikilo-tolerance, e.g., the ability to endure xeric conditions, desiccation, high UV-radiation and temperatures (Sterflinger et al., 2012) and to feed on alternative carbon sources like monoaromatic compounds (Nai et al., 2013) and synthetic polyesters (Tesei et al., 2020). K. chersonesos aptitude to withstand levels of gaseous ozone up to 11 ppm was also shown (Tesei et al., unpublished). Furthermore, being the only black fungus known to have a melanin-deficient spontaneous mutant (Tesei et al., 2017), K. chersonesos allows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the stress-protective role of melanin. Cultures of K. chersonesos wild type and mutant were grown in HARVs and analyzed for changes at the proteome—whole-cell proteome (mycelia) and secretome (culture supernatant)—and at the morphological level, with an eye toward the impact of cell-wall melanization on the physiological response to the stress.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Fungal Strains The fungal strains used in this study included the non-pathogenic rock-inhabiting fungus K. chersonesos MA5789 wild type (Wt) and MA5790 mutant (Mut), both obtained from the ACBR fungal culture collection of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria. The Wt, characterized by a highly melanized mycelium, was isolated from red sandstone in Ny London, Svalbard, Norway. The pink mutant, whose pigmentation is due to unmasking of carotenoids resulting from the lack of melanin, originated spontaneously under laboratory conditions (Tesei et al., 2017). K. chersonesos (syn. K. petricola) is an emerging model organism for analyses aiming at the elucidation of the rock-lifestyle and RIF physiology (Nai et al., 2013). Along with its ascertained thermo-, pH-, UV- and desiccation tolerance (Gorbushina et al., 2008; Sterflinger et al., 2012), the fungus was recently reported to have an aptitude for using synthetic polymers as an alternative carbon source (Tesei et al., 2020). These features and the ability to endure high levels of gaseous ozone (Tesei et al., unpublished), altogether make K. chersonesos particularly suited for astrobiology studies. Further, the availability of a mutant strain allows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the role of melanin in stress protection. Fungal cultures were maintained in flasks containing 50 mL of 2% malt extract broth (MEB, pH 5, 2% malt extract, 2% glucose, 1% peptone) at 21°C with shaking at 63 rpm (Innova, Eppendorf). Cultures at exponential phase were used for inoculation of media for all experiments. Exposure to Low-Shear Simulated Microgravity (LSSMG) Fungal pellets were obtained from 5-day-old cultures by centrifugation, washed in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently mildly ribolyzed (3 × 20”, speed 4; MP Biomedicals) to separate cells. As clump-like growth is an inherent characteristic of black fungi, mechanical disruption of cell clusters is a prerequisite for both inoculation of cultures and cell counting (Voigt et al., 2020). Following the cell count (Neubauer), the cell number was adjusted to the initial concentration of 2 × 105 ml–1 with 10 mL fresh 2% MEB and used as seed culture. High-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs; Synthecon Inc) were filled with the cell suspensions (10 mL) and rotated at 30 rpm (initial rotation rate) in the vertical axis to provide LSSMG conditions inside a chamber with 60% humidity and 22°C, for 7 days. Control runs were set up by rotating the bioreactors in the horizontal axis to provide normal gravity condition (1G) (Rosenzweig et al., 2010; Kim and Rhee, 2016). During cultivation, the rotation speed was adjusted to 43 rpm in order to keep the cells pellets orbiting within the vessel in continual fall and to prevent their contact with the vessel walls (Figures 1A,B). A total of two biological replicates were maintained throughout the experiments. An additional set of experiments identical to the conditions mentioned above was established for measurement of cell concentration and microscope observations. Cell concentration was assessed via hemocytometer count at different time points until completion of the experiment, using two biological replicates (i.e., biomass from two different vessels) for each experimental condition. Following removal of the vessel from the rotator base, samples of cells were collected under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood using a luer-lock syringe and the syringe port in the culture vessel. The sampling was carried out one vessel at a time while the remaining vessels were kept rotating on the rotator base. Cell survivability at the end of the LSSMG exposure was assessed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFU) using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012), according to Choudhry (2016). FIGURE 1.

The HARVs provide oxygenation via a flat, silicon rubber gas transfer membrane located at the base of the vessel and directly underneath the cultures. Microscopy Studies Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) For SEM studies, samples from the two strains were collected from all the established cultures—LSSMG and normal gravity condition (1G)—at various timepoints, i.e., 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. A 1:10 dilution of each sample was prepared using 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and thereafter transferred onto electron microscopy coupons. For each sample, two biological replicates (and two technical replicates each i.e., aliquots of 20 μl) were prepared and let dry at 35°C before examination. A Sirion (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, United States) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used for examination of the fungal cells. No specimen preparation procedures, such as sample coating with a surface-conducting (carbon or metal) layer, were performed as they were not necessary when using the FE-SEM. The samples were analyzed using an acceleration voltage of 10–20 kV, beam current of 40–50 mA and positioning the detector 6–10 mm away from the coupon. Secondary electron images were acquired in the high-vacuum mode. For each sample coupon, a minimum of 10 fields was observed, and images were acquired with various magnification (100×–5,000×).Fluorescence Microscopy For the cell integrity and viability assay, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and propidium iodide (PI) in combination with SYTO 9 were used. The carbohydrate-binding lectin WGA has a known affinity for β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligomers present in the fungal polysaccharide chitin. PI, a membrane impermeant dye that is generally excluded from viable cells, was applied together with the nuclear and chromosome counterstain SYTO 9 for a dead/live stain. 200 μl aliquots were collected from all the established cultures after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. Fungal cells were washed twice in 1X PBS and suspended in 500 μl. Following a 1:10 dilution, 100 μl cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate of WGA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 15 μl of FungaLight containing equal amounts of PI and SYTO 9 solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The chosen amounts of the fluorescent probes are justified by the thickening and the increase in melanization of the cell walls, which hindered the staining process. Cell suspensions were mounted over glass slides and analyzed under an Axioplane microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Carl Zeiss). For each sample, two technical replicates were prepared for observation. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-Based Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics Sample Preparation The content of each vessel was spun at 7500 × g (5810, Eppendorf) and at 4°C for 15 min to separate fungal cell pellet (mycelium) from culture supernatant (secretome). Protease inhibitors (10 μl:1 mL v/v, Halt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were thereafter added—and mixed with 1 mL 1 × PBS in the case of biomass samples—and samples were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction. Proteins were extracted as previously described by Romsdahl et al. (2018) with some modifications. In brief, 1 mL lysis buffer consisting of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to fungal cell pellets (i.e., ∼0.5 g) and culture supernatants (i.e., ∼0.5 mL), the latter previously concentrated in a SpeedVac system. Sample homogenization was achieved using a bead beater (Bertin) at 4°C (3 × 5500 rpm for 1 min., with 15 s. breaks in between) and following centrifugation at 17,000 × g and 4°C for 15 min, protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein extracts were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). For each sample, 250 μg proteins were precipitated in 20% TCA at 4°C, reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA), and digested with Trypsin/LysC (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) overnight at 37°C. Peptide quantitation was performed using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteomic and secretomic profiling of K. chersonesos Wt and Mut were carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. A total of 40 μg peptides from each cell pellet sample or 13 μg peptides from each culture supernatant were labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMT10 plex (TMT10) Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit according to the manufacturer protocol. Eight TMT tags were used to label samples from the same experimental set. The TMT10-131 label was used as a reference that contained a pool of 5 μg of peptides from all samples. All nine labeled-peptide samples were combined into a single tube, mixed and fractionated using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and dissolved in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.LC-MS/MS Analysis The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system, a 300 μm × 5 mm PepMap100 C18 precolumn, a 75 μm × 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (5 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (1 min), 90% solvent B (1 min), and 90% to 3% solvent B (3 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (400–1,600 m/z) was acquired in the orbitrap at a resolution of 240,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4 × 105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2–7 within a ± 10 ppm mass window using a 60 s dynamic exclusion. The MS2 scan (400–1,200 m/z) was performed using the linear ion trap with the CID collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 1 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 30 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were then simultaneously selected for an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (100–500 m/z) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000 and using HCD at a collision energy setting of 65%, an AGC target of 5 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 54 ms.Quantitative Proteomics Analysis All MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against an in-house annotated draft genome sequence of K. chersonesos MA5789 Wt (GCA_002319055.1, assembly ASM231905v1, ) (Tesei et al., 2017) consisting of 9.818 predicted protein coding gene models. The genome was annotated using funannotate (v1.3.4) (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1284502), which combined predictions from ab initio gene predictors with Augustus trained by BUSCO gene models (fungi_odb9) (Zdobnov et al., 2017) and GeneMark.hmm (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008) informed by protein evidence from Swiss-Prot (Boutet et al., 2007) together into composite gene models with EvidenceModeler (Haas et al., 2008). Functional predictions for genes was assigned by protein homology to Pfam (El-gebali et al., 2019), Swiss-Prot/UniProt (v 2018_05), and EggNog (v1.10) databases (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019). The following parameters were selected for the search: A maximum of two missed cleavage sites, a minimum peptide length of six residues, 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses, and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of protein N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co-isolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The quantitative abundance of each protein was determined from the total intensity of the detected reporter ions. For statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was log2 transformed, and the technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide and quantified in all technical (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2), were considered for the statistical analysis. Student’s t-test was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins between each LSSMG-exposed and 1G-exposed group as well as between all groups. To compare all four experimental conditions, each condition was normalized to the reference channel, which contained equal amounts of peptides from each group. To evaluate changes between treatment (LSSMG) and control (1G), the protein abundance levels of each LSSMG-exposed sample were normalized to the 1G-exposed counterpart. Proteins with p-values of ≤0.05 were further evaluated for increased or decreased abundance using a cut-off value of ≥ ± 1.5-fold change (log2 fold change of ≥ ± 0.584). Protein Identification and Bioinformatics Analysis Protein identifications and functional insights were obtained from searching for sequence homologs using OmicsBox v. 1.4.11 (BioBam Bioinformatics S.L). To characterize proteins with respect to the biological process they are involved in, Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to domains. The sequences were blasted (cloud BLASTP 2.10.0+, E-Value 1.0E-3, Filter: Fungi), and the blast hits were mapped and annotated with GOs using the GO database (Goa version 2019_111; E-Value 1.0E-6, Filter GO by Taxonomy: taxa: 4751, Fungi) (Götz et al., 2008). GOs were additionally assigned using InterProScan (IPS) to retrieve domains/motif information in a sequence-wise manner, and EggNOG using precomputed EggNOG-based orthology assignments. Corresponding GOs were then transferred to the sequences and merged with already existing GO terms. The annotations were validated based on the True-Path-Rule by removing all redundant terms to a given sequence. A GO-Slim analysis was run to summarize the GO annotation using the Aspergillus slim. Existing GO terms were additionally mapped to enzymes codes, when possible. A pathway analysis was performed to retrieve metabolic pathways based on the GO terms and the enzyme codes using the Load KEGG Pathway tool (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). To elucidate the identity of the uncharacterized proteins, a search for homology was further performed in the UniProtKB database2 (BLASTP parameters: E-Threshold: 10; matrix BLOSUM62). In cases of blast results where the most significant match was represented by an uncharacterized protein, the first match in the list of homologous proteins where a protein ID was available was considered. Information about the predicted protein localization was obtained using BUSCA3, based on the identification of signal and transit peptides, GPI-anchors and alpha-helical and beta-stranded transmembrane domains (Savojardo et al., 2018). Protein-protein interaction analyses were performed using STRING v11.0 with high confidence (0.70) (Jensen et al., 2009), selecting the proteome of the black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis as reference database based on its phylogenetic proximity to K. chersonesos (Tesei et al., 2020).",
    "results": "Results Growth Behavior Cell concentration in the LSSMG-exposed and unexposed samples was measured via hemocytometer at four different time points: (1) start (seed, day 0), (2) acceleration phase (in between lag and exponential phases, day 3), (3) exponential phase (day 5) and (4) at the end of the experiment (stationary phase, day 7). In K. chersonesos WtLSSMG, ∼23.5-fold increase in cell concentration was observed during acceleration phase when compared to the original inoculum (2 × 105 cells/mL). Such an increase during acceleration phase was also noticed in K. chersonesos MutLSSMG (10-fold), K. chersonesos Wt1G (22-fold) and K. chersonesos Mut1G (19-fold). During stationary phase the increase in cell concentration was 28-fold (K. chersonesos WtLSSMG), 30-fold (K. chersonesos MutLSSMG), 42-fold (K. chersonesos Wt1G), and 36-fold (K. chersonesos Mut1G) when compared to original inoculum. Among LSSMG and Earth gravity grown cultures, higher values were recorded at normal gravity condition. Overall, only ∼one log growth in 7 days might be due to the clumping nature of Knufia cells. Cell survivability in simulated microgravity was measured by CFU using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012) according to established protocol (Choudhry, 2016) and were: K. chersonesos WtLSSMG = 2.8 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos MutLSSMG 2.5 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos Wt1G 2.6 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos Mut1G 2.3 × 106 cell/mL (Supplementary Table 1). Potential mechanical damages or cell lysis caused by cell separation via mild bead beating (i.e., ribolyzer, 3 × 20 s, speed 4) prior to cell count are to be excluded since optical microscope observations and tests involving repeated bead beater treatments indicated that it does not decrease cell viability. However, underestimation of cell survivability by CFU due to cell clumping, an inherent characteristic of black fungi, should be taken into account. Under LSMMG conditions, fungal cells showed an increased clumping, resulting in the aggregation of cells to form a mycelial growth in the center of the vessel. However, growth morphology under Earth gravity resembled a biofilm of cells adhering to the vessel’s oxygenation membrane (Figure 1C). Microscopy To evaluate the presence of LSSMG-dependent alterations of fungal cell morphology in the melanotic (Wt) and non-melanized spontaneous mutant (Mut) strain, we examined cellular differentiation by growing cells at low density. In order to analyze single cellular morphology of the Wt and Mut strain before LSSMG-treatment, exponentially growing fungal cells were spotted on top of aluminum coupons and visualized using FE-SEM. The observation of the control fungal cell morphology in non-coated FE-SEM specimens revealed that the Wt produced biconcave cells, pseudohyphae and hyphae, while the mutant showed smooth spherical cells, pseudohyphae and cell aggregates (Figures 2, 3). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) micrographs of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut on aluminum coupons during a 7-days exposure to LSSMG or 1G (control). Arrows indicate hyphal growth in the wild type and dense cell aggregation in the mutant strain.FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab FE-SEM micrographs of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut on aluminum coupons during a 7-days exposure to LSSMG or 1G (control). Details of cells morphology are shown; arrows indicate biconcave cell morphology.Low-shear simulated microgravity-exposed and 1G-exposed fungal cells were collected at various time points, as described in the section “Materials and Methods.” A detailed examination of fungal cellular morphology in non-coated FE-SEM specimens revealed 1G and LSSMG Wt and mutant strains showing similar morphology at day 1 and 3. Remarkably, the 1G Wt hyphae formation was delayed until day 7, whereas LSSMG induced hyphae formation at day 5 (Figure 2). Notably, the mutant showed no evidence of hyphae formation in LSSMG condition, but the aggregation of cells was evident at day 3 and increased until day 7, similarly to what was observed in the 1G cells (Figure 2). Furthermore, a closer observation of Wt and mutant fungal cells in LSSMG and 1G condition at 2500× magnification clearly shows that the Wt cells form biconcave morphology compared to the mutant cells (Figure 3). LSSMG treatment led to no significant change in cell size relative to 1G conditions, in either strain (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, images of PI-SYTO 9 and WGA staining generated by confocal microscopy did not reveal changes in cell viability and integrity in response to LSSMG exposure. Greatest fluorescence was seen with WGA at the beginning of the cultivation, although increasing concentrations of the dye were applied; this is most probably due to the thickening of the cell wall and increase of melanization, which naturally occurs in the fungus over the course of cultivation (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, these findings uncover that the LSSMG and 1G conditions did not influence the fungal cellular growth and morphology. Overview of Whole-Cell Proteome and Secretome Analysis The 16 samples, comprised of four experimental conditions with two biological replicates each for each of the analyzed strains, yielded 3777 proteins as detected by isobaric TMT labeling-based LC-MS/MS. Of these, 3177 were in the whole-cell proteome and 600 in the secreted fraction. Furthermore, 2602 proteins were unique to the proteome and 25 to the secretome, while 575 were found to overlap (Figure 4A). A total of 3163 were identified by homology search. An overview of the biological and molecular functions of the detected proteins was obtained through an annotation statistics analysis. Distribution of the GO terms for all 3 categories (i.e., biological process BP, molecular function MF, and cellular component CC), with the highest number of associated protein sequences in the whole-cell proteome and the secretome, is displayed in Supplementary Figures 2A,B. Several GOs were common to proteome and secretome, whereas others were instead unique to each set of proteins. GOs for different types of cell metabolic processes were the most represented in both secretory and intracellular proteins, whereas BPs such as response to chemical, cell cycle, and negative regulation of cellular processes were found exclusively within the latter. Conversely, proteins involved in cell communication and positive regulation of cellular process could solely be detected in the secreted fraction of the proteome. Proteins with hydrolase activity (MF GO:0016787) represented the most abundant group in the secretome and second most abundant in the whole-cell proteome, immediately followed by proteins with organic cyclic and heterocyclic compound binding, oxidoreductase and transferase activity. In both sets of samples, proteins with transcription and translation regulation activity were instead detected as the smallest groups. A distribution analysis for cellular component GO terms indicated a prevalence of intracellular, membrane, and cell wall proteins (i.e., CC GO: envelope) also in the culture supernatant—i.e., the ratio of total proteins with predicted extracellular to intracellular localization was approximately 25%:75% in the wild type and 6%:94% in the mutant—where the detection of cytoplasmic proteins is possibly due to mechanical stress and cell death (Miura and Ueda, 2018). Nonetheless, the presence of these proteins in the secreted fraction could also depend on active secretion of proteins with no predicted signal peptide, i.e., non-classical protein secretion, which has been recognized in various organisms including fungi, bacteria and plants based on the large number of leaderless proteins detected in extracellular compartments, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Regente et al., 2012; Vallejo et al., 2012; Sun and Su, 2019). The 25 proteins uniquely detected in the secretome encompassed a number of carboxylic ester hydrolases with predicted extracellular localization alongside cytoplasmic, cell wall– and plasma membrane-associated proteins (Supplementary Table 3). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Proteins identified and detected as regulated in the whole-cell proteome and secretome of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut following exposure to LSSMG. (A) Overlap of proteins between whole-cell proteome and secretome, identified in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. (B) Number of differentially abundant proteins for each strain under LSSMG compared to 1G (control) (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05). (C) Heat map hierarchical clustering of co-varying proteins quantified in each strain. The color key indicates the values that represented the protein abundance ratio (log2) and the number of proteins counted in each value. A total of 6 runs – 3 technical replicates and 2 biological replicates – were performed for each sample. Wt, wild type; Mut, mutant; w-cp, whole-cell proteome; s, secretome. Heatmaps were generated using R.In order to detect significant rearrangements in the protein pool upon exposure to LSSMG, a quantitative analysis was carried out by comparing experimental groups. The clustering of the samples, biological and technical replicates included, was confirmed by Hierarchical Cluster (HC) analysis (Figure 4C). However, one of the LSSMG-exposed secretomes from K. chersonesos Wt appeared to deviate from the biological duplicate of the same condition. The number of differentially abundant proteins for each strain is summarized in Figure 4 (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05), where (B) shows the count of regulated proteins following direct comparison of treatment and control whole-cell proteome and secretome samples. The mutant proteome contained the largest number of modulated proteins (115) compared to the mutant secretome (71), the wild type proteome (97), and the wild type secretome (11). Effects of LSSMG on Knufia chersonesos Whole-Cell Proteome The proteomic quantitative analysis of LSSMG-exposed K. chersonesos Wt and Mut revealed 54-up and 43-down and 45-up and 70-down regulated proteins, respectively, when compared to the 1G-exposed counterparts (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 4, 5). Distribution of over-represented BP GO terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Figure 5A. Most significantly upregulated biological processes included “lipid and carbohydrate metabolism” in both strains (24 to 28% of all upregulated proteins). However, 15% of downregulated proteins were also in the carbohydrate metabolism category. By contrast, proteins involved in lipid metabolic processes were not found to be decreased. Further, “transcription” (12%) and “transport” (27%) were additional highly represented categories of upregulated proteins in the wild type, whereas “transport” (28%) and “amino acid metabolic process” (16%) were well represented categories of upregulated proteins in the mutant. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Biological processes GOs categories of differentially expressed proteins in Knufia chersonesos under LSSMG. (A) Whole-cell proteome (B) Secretome. Proteins with changed abundance (FC ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) were annotated with terms representing various biological processes using OmicsBox v. 1.4.11 (https://www.biobam.com). GO terms were thereafter summarized using sequence distribution/GO multilevel pie charts (Filtered by sequence count, Cutoff = 2).Proteins involved in lipid metabolism included CF317_002955-T1/C7ZGD6_NECH7—predicted to be phospholipase A2—an acetyl-CoA desaturase (CF317_004579-T1/A0A072PJ62_9EURO) and the uncharacterized protein CF317_000532-T1/A0A0D2C8U2_9EURO upregulated in both strains, along with an inositol-3-phosphate synthase (CF317_006213-T1/A0A0D2GI50_9EURO), which was instead solely observed in the mutant. These proteins participate in cellular pathways for the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (KEGG pathway 01040) and the metabolism of phospho- and glycerophospholipids (KEGG 00564), inositol phosphate (KEGG 00562), arachidonic and linoleic acid, among others (Table 1; Passoth, 2017). Pyruvate metabolism (KEGG 00620), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (KEGG 00010) and starch and sucrose metabolism, were possibly also involved in the response to LSSMG, as revealed by the KEGG pathway analysis based on the increased abundance of proteins like alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (CF317_005767-T1/A0A0N0NIW7_9EURO) and alpha/beta-glucosidase agdC (CF317_006579-T1/A0A178BWA1_9EURO) in the wild type. Glutamine synthetase and protein FYV10, the first involved in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (KEGG 00630) and in nitrogen metabolism (Zhang et al., 2017) and the latter mediating the degradation of enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway (Braun et al., 2011), were instead detected as upregulated in the mutant. Decreased levels of a number of hydrolytic enzymes destined for secretion were observed in the LSSMG-exposed proteomes for the carboxylic ester hydrolases CF317_0002308-T1/A0A1J9RJA8_9PEZI, CF317_007618-T1/A0A6A6HNE7_9PEZI, CF317_007621-T1/A0A0D2AG04_9PEZI (in Wt) and CF317_002086-T1/A0A0D2BHT9_9EURO (in Mut). The same was observed for the cell wall–degradation enzymes endo- and extracellular glucanases CF317_0009683-T1/W9ZBZ7_9EURO and CF317_009779-T1/H6BQE2_EXODN (in Wt) and the 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase CF317_000932-T1/A0A1C1D1N7_9EURO (in Mut), the latter of which is involved in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in beta oxidation (Janssen et al., 1994).

number in the K. chersonesos database of ab initio translated proteins.A differential abundance of proteins involved in transport was also observed (Table 1). Transmembrane ammonium (CF317_007500-T1/A0A072PWW7_9EURO) and iron transporters (i.e., HemS domain-containing protein CF317_008807-T1/L7HNA7_MAGOY) and the choline transport protein (CF317_009191-T1/A0A2P8A4S9_9PEZI) were present in the LSSMG-exposed whole-cell proteome of both strains, but they were more increased in the mutant (over 3-, 2. 4-, and 1.5-folds, respectively) than in the wild type (slightly over 1.5-folds). Additionally, two AA permease 2 domain-containing proteins (CF317_005369-T1/A0A0D2FEL3_9EURO and CF317_002132-T1/A0A438N399_EXOME) responsible for transmembrane amino acid transport were also upregulated in the mutant, whereas proteins with a predicted role in vesicle-mediated transport—i.e., VPS37 C-terminal domain-containing protein (CF317_007988-T1/A0A0D2CPQ3_9EURO) and WD_REPEATS_REGION domain-containing protein (CF317_001709-T1/A0A438MTR2_EXOME)—were exclusively detected in the wild type counterpart. Downregulated proteins included POT family proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (CF317_001542-T1/A0A072P870_9EURO) and major facilitator superfamily transporters (MFS) (CF317_001911-T1/W9Z1V7_9EURO), involved in transportation of substrate molecules, including sugars, drugs, metabolites, amino acids, vitamins, and both organic and inorganic ions, or small peptides (Pao and Paulsen, 1998). Together with ABC transporters, MFS transporters are often detected among the cell wall components undergoing changes in response to the shift from normal gravity to microgravity (Sathishkumar et al., 2016). Low-shear simulated microgravity additionally triggered upregulation of some proteins involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes and downregulation of others (Table 1). Glutamate dehydrogenase was threefold and fourfold upregulated in K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, respectively. Together with the glutamine synthase, whose levels were also found to be increased in the mutant, the enzyme is reportedly involved in the primary nitrogen metabolism and in the biosynthesis and metabolism of several amino acids (i.e., arginine biosynthesis, glutamine, alanine and aspartate metabolism) (Meti et al., 2011). Protein D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (CF317_004816-T1/A0A0D2CHE2_9EURO), participating in cysteine, methionine, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, was also more enriched in LSSMG-exposed mutant samples. However, a higher number of enzymes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes was found to be decreased under LSSMG. Nine were downregulated exclusively in the mutant, while protein CF317_006402-T1 was observed also in the wild type. According to the KEGG analysis, some of these proteins are involved with more than one pathway: 4 proteins are implicated in arginine and proline metabolism (CF317_000519-T1, CF317_007970-T1, CF317_007070-T1, CF317_008030-T1), 3 in tyrosine metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006402-T1, CF317_008924-T1), and 2 in histidine metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006712-T1), arginine biosynthesis (CF317_002693-T1, CF317_000519-T1) and phenylalanine biosynthesis and metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006402-T1). The putative indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, involved instead in tryptophan catabolic process to the NAD precursor kynurenine, represented the most decreased protein in both strains, with an over 2-fold downregulation. Some proteins falling into the GO category “DNA-templated transcription” were enriched exclusively in the LSSMG-exposed wild type proteome. They were mostly phosphatases—known to also regulate pathways important for stress (Serra-Cardona et al., 2015)—having abundances nearly 2.5-fold higher than in the control samples (i.e., Alkaline phosphatase CF317_008227-T1/A0A0D2BGD8_9EURO and CF317_003892-T1/A0A0D2BGD8_9EURO) (Table 1). Within the same category, downregulation was observed for a putative serine/threonine-protein kinase TOR and two trans domain-containing proteins involved in DNA binding and transcription. Decreased levels of structural protein constituents of the large ribosomal subunit—i.e., ribosomal protein L37e, L34-B and L24e—were instead detected upon LSSMG exposure exclusively in the wild type, alongside the upregulation of the ribonuclease T1 (CF317_005207-T1/W9XBV2_9EURO) involved in RNA degradation. Also significantly decreased was poly(A)polymerase (CF317_003175-T1/A0A1C1CN69_9EURO), an important component in mRNA synthesis, responsible for the addition of the 3′ polyadenine tail to a newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA. In the group of proteins involved in response to stress and chemical, most of the modulated proteins were decreased by LSSMG exposure (Table 1). Downregulated stress response proteins included catalases (i.e., CF317_000687-T1/R8BNJ4_TOGMI, levels 2.7- and 1.9-fold lower than in the unexposed wild type and mutant proteome, respectively; CF317_003242-T1/R4XE87_TAPDE and CF317_008773-T1/U1G9G0_ENDPU), notably involved in the response to oxidative stress, and the 3-phytase CF317_007018-T1/A0A0D2IHR9_9EURO—a phosphatase enzyme with a predicted role in counteracting phosphate deficiency and osmotic stress (Belgaroui et al., 2018)—in both strains. Further, the glutathione-recycling enzyme glutathione reductase (CF317_008426-T1/A0A0D1ZJU8_9EURO) (Couto et al., 2016), the histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (CF317_007412-T1/H6BQ73_EXODN) and the adenylosuccinate synthetase (ASS; F317_004909-T1/W9W243_9EURO), showed lower levels in the mutant under LSSMG conditions. The latter, best known as the first enzyme in the de novo synthesis of AMP from inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP), is responsive to salt stress, as reported in plants (Zhao et al., 2013). Among the proteins with increased abundance in both fungal strains, was glutamate dehydrogenase (CF317_004755-T1), involved in amino acid metabolism and for which a stress-dependent regulation has been demonstrated (e.g., abiotic stress generated ROS) (Skopelitis et al., 2006). Further, the putative cytosolic nitric oxide dioxygenase (CF317_006388-T1/S7Z8A1_PENO1)—reported to play a role in nitric oxide detoxification mechanisms by the conversion of this signaling molecule to nitrate (Cánovas et al., 2016)—was present in the wild type and mutant LSSMG-exposed proteomes at levels around 2-fold higher than that of the unexposed ones. Along with the above-mentioned proteins, a number of enzymes, specifically peptidases involved in proteolysis, were found to be upregulated exclusively in K. chersonesos wild type (Table 1). The putative carboxypeptidase CF317_008840-T1/W9XS38_9EURO and CF317_004157/W2S3B3_9EURO; and CF317_000103/A0A6A6DDQ8_9PEZI and CF317_004551/A0A0D2GVY9_9EURO, known to catalyze reactions that are important to various physiological processes, such as the cell cycle, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response (Neto et al., 2018), were 2-fold and 1.5-fold upregulated, respectively. Lastly, proteins involved in cytoskeleton and organelle organization showed opposite regulation in the two K. chersonesos strains: The first was decreased in the wild type, whereas the latter was upregulated in the mutant (Table 1). Effects of LSSMG on Knufia chersonesos Secretome The proteomic characterization of K. chersonesos secretome upon exposure to LSSMG for 7 days revealed solely 9-up and 2-down regulated proteins in the wild type and 23-up and 48-down regulated proteins in the mutant, when compared to the 1G-exposed counterparts (fold-change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) (Figure 4B). Among these proteins, the ratio of proteins with predicted extracellular to intracellular localization was approximately 20%:80% in both wild type and mutant (Supplementary Tables 6, 7). Out of 14 proteins with predicted signal peptides in the mutant secretome, 12 were regulated following LSSMG-exposure. In the wild type secretome, 2 out of 61 proteins with predicted extracellular localization were regulated in response to microgravity. The distribution of differentially expressed proteins among BP GO terms is presented in Figure 5B. In the wild type, the regulated proteins were prevalently involved in transport and metabolic processes, whereas in the mutant strain, regulated proteins were mostly involved with biological processes such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (15 proteins), response to chemical and stress (13 proteins), translation, and ribosome biogenesis and transcription (15 proteins). Interestingly, the majority of proteins involved in the above-mentioned GO BP categories exhibited downregulation in LSSMG-exposed secretomes of the mutant and exhibited upregulation in the wild type (Table 2). One protein exhibiting opposite regulation in the two analyzed strains, was the putative scytalone dehydratase CF317_002654-T1, homolog of Phialophora attinorum A0A0N1P280_9EURO. This enzyme, which is reportedly involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin from endogenous substrate (Eisenman and Casadevall, 2012), was 1.5-fold increased in the wild type and 1.6-fold decreased in the melanin-deficient mutant. In the wild type, upregulated proteins also included the adenylosuccinate lyase CF317_004119-T1 and the M20_dimer domain-containing protein (Carboxypeptidase S) CF317_006825-T1, both implicated in amino acid (alanine, aspartate and glutamate) metabolism (KEGG pathway pae00250), and the plasma membrane ATPase CF317_002664-T1, partaking in oxidative phosphorylation (Table 2). Also in the wild type, the casein kinase I 1 CF317_004827-T1 and the histone H2A CF317_001633-T1, both involved in DNA repair (Skoneczna et al., 2018), were found in the LSSMG-exposed secretome at levels 1.7- and 1.6-fold higher than in the unexposed one. The two downregulated proteins were protein CF317_008131-T1, homolog of the arabinan endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinosidase from Aspergillus wentii DTO 134E9, and protein CF317_002949-T1, homolog of the feruloyl esterase A0A177BY00_9PLEO from Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, both with a predicted extracellular localization and reportedly involved in polysaccharide degradation (Tesei et al., 2020).

proteome (p ≤ 0.05). aProtein accession number in the K. chersonesos database of ab initio translated proteins.In the K. chersonesos mutant, LSSMG triggered the upregulation of just a low number of proteins. The malate dehydrogenase CF317_003266-T1/A0A1C1CNC5_9EURO, 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1/A0A438MTW5_EXOME and alpha, alpha-trehalase CF317_004588-T1/H6C927_EXODN, involved in the metabolism of starch, sucrose, and sphingolipids, were 2. 4-, 1.9-, and 1.8-fold upregulated, respectively. Conversely, proteins with decreased abundance encompassed, among others, enzymes catalyzing different steps throughout the process of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (KEGG pathway hsa00010)—such as the putative phosphotransferase CF317_008448/W2RU25_9EURO, the phosphoglycerate kinase CF317_004751/W2RJE3_9EURO and the 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase CF317_003513/H6BNI5_EXODN—fructose and mannose (hsa00051), pyruvate (hsa00620) and glycerolipid metabolism (hsa00561), and the pentose phosphate pathway (hsa00030) (i.e., phosphotransferase, epimerase domain-containing protein CF317_008979 and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating CF317_005481). Further, the CF317_007096/A0A0U1M0E3_TALIS 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, acting as an activator of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (Raben and Wolfgang, 2019), was the most decreased protein in the GO category of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with a 3-fold downregulation. Increased levels of proteins with a role in the response to stress and chemicals (Table 2) were observed in the exposed secretomes for the plasma membrane protein CF317_000051-T1/A0A178DA36_9EURO with reported phosphatase activity and the guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta CF317_007665-T1/A0A0D2CV56_9EURO with a role in signal transduction, among others. However, as already observed for the whole-cell proteome, the majority of proteins involved in stress response showed decreased abundance upon exposure to LSSMG. The DNA-repair protein histone H2A (CF317_001633-T1), upregulated in the wild type secretome, was at least twofold downregulated in the mutant, together with the nucleoside diphosphate kinase CF317_007147-T1/A0A178C9G0_9EURO. The latter, ubiquitous enzyme involved in nucleotides biosynthetic process (Janin and Deville-Bonne, 2002), has been shown to participate in the metabolism of selective drugs like Isoniazid and Fluorouracil (KEGG map00983) in Homo sapiens. The same was observed for the S-formylglutathione hydrolase, whose activity is mainly linked to methane metabolism and the recycling of glutathione in cell detoxification pathways (Haslam et al., 2002; Yurimoto et al., 2003). Similarly, the thioredoxin domain-containing protein CF317_000980-T1 and the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating CF317_005481-T1/A0A0N0NLG1_9EURO, both involved in cell redox homeostasis and glutathione metabolism (Li et al., 2019), showed an around twofold downregulation. Also in the categories of transcription, translation, and ribosome biogenesis, downregulated proteins outnumbered the upregulated ones (Table 2). The most increased protein (almost twofold) was the putative D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) domain-containing protein CF317_008030-T1/A0A0D1YYX4_9EURO, also involved in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis (KEGG 00311). Elongation factor EF-1 beta and gamma subunit (CF317_008933-T1 and CF317_000379-T1), homologs of Exophiala dermatitidis CBS 525.76 H6BVG8_EXODN and H6BY84_EXODN proteins and involved in purine metabolism (KEGG 00230), were detected in the mutant LSSMG-exposed secretome at levels at least 3.5-fold lower than that of the unexposed ones. Further, four ribosomal proteins—i.e., 40S ribosomal protein S20 and S24 (CF317_001861-T1 and CF317_004501-T1); 60S ribosomal protein P1 and L7 (CF317_007960-T1 and CF317_005516-T1)—showed decreased abundance. Additionally downregulated in response to LSSMG were the uncharacterized HIT domain-containing protein CF317_006677-T1 (over 3-fold regulated) and the putative versicolorin reductase CF317_003229-T1 (over 2-fold regulated), the latter known to mediate aflatoxins biosynthetic processes (Nakamura et al., 2011). Modulation was also observed in proteins involved in transport such as the above-mentioned 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1 with a role on starch and sucrose metabolism, the endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein CF317_004472-T1, and the inorganic phosphate transport protein PHO88 CF317_006347-T1, which all appeared to be upregulated. Conversely, the transmembrane transporter “putative inorganic phosphate transporter C8E4.01c” CF317_002531-T1, the uncharacterized NTF2 domain-containing protein CF317_007808-T1, and the glycolytic enzyme phosphotransferase CF317_008448-T1 were detected as downregulated. Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut Exhibit Opposite Regulation of Several Differentially Expressed Proteins The comparative analysis of all examined samples to a reference sample—a pool of all established experimental conditions—revealed qualitative and quantitative differences between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut at the proteome and secretome level. This was especially evident when examining the top 10 differentially regulated proteins i.e., the 10 most up- and downregulated proteins at each experimental condition. A number of these proteins were found to undergo opposite modulation in the two strains, mainly in the whole-cell proteome. Distribution of the top differentially regulated whole-cell proteins is summarized in Supplementary Table 8: out of 41 different proteins, 6 were found to be top regulated in wild type and mutant under both normal gravity and microgravity condition, 10 only in the Wt and 10 exclusively in the Mut. Around 25% represented ribosomal proteins; 10% were proteins whose identity or function could not be elucidated after homology search; and the remaining proteins were involved in RNA binding, transcription, translation, transport, and carbohydrate metabolism. Out of the 49 top differentially regulated proteins from the secreted fraction, 2 were found in both strains at all experimental conditions, 17 only in the Wt and 17 only in the Mut (Supplementary Table 9). Similar to what was observed for the proteome, 26% of the detected proteins were ribosomal, followed by enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (18%)—secreted esterases and lipases included—and in transport (10%). Altogether, the eight top differentially regulated proteins common to wild type and mutant in both normal gravity and microgravity—i.e., the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal proteins L28 (CF317_000935-T1), L32 (CF317_002712-T1), L35 (CF317_001879-T1) and L36 (CF317_007709-T1), the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal protein S30 (CF317_005321-T1), the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (CF317_001622-T1), the murein transglycosylase (CF317_006383-T1) and the uncharacterized protein CF317_007965-T1—displayed an LSSMG-dependent regulation that also appeared to be specific to the Wt strain (Supplementary Figure 3). As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, all proteins that are upregulated in the Wt strain appear to be downregulated in the Mut strain and vice versa. A protein-protein interaction analysis was performed to verify the occurrence of these 8 proteins in common pathways, using STRING. A 6-node network was obtained for the proteins which matched homologs (sequence homology) in the STRING database (Supplementary Figure 4) and an interaction was confirmed for ribosomal proteins S30 (homolog of E. dermatitidis XP_009156842.1) and L35 (homolog of XP_009155966.1). As a component of the SSU, S30 has a role in mRNAs binding and selection of cognate aminoacyl-transferase RNA (tRNA), whereas L35 is required for polymerization of the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain (Ben-Shem et al., 2011). The involvement of protein L35 in cell growth regulation and apoptosis has additionally been reported (Bommer and Stahl, 2005). The proteins’ functional link (combined score: 0.999) was supported by evidence such as the co-expression of orthologs (score 0.963) and their interaction in other organisms (experimental/biochemical data, score: 0.904). Further interactions could not be detected possibly because functional characterization of these proteins in E. dermatitidis is yet to be thoroughly achieved. Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut Comparative Analysis Under Normal Gravity (1G) A comparative analysis of wild type and mutant was performed to evaluate different responses at the proteome and secretome level under control condition, i.e., normal gravity. The analysis of the whole-cell proteome yielded a total of 100 proteins with increased and 40 proteins with decreased abundance in K. chersonesos Mut, compared with the wild type (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05). As shown in Supplementary Figure 5A, “protein translation,” “organelle organization,” and “regulation of biological processes” were detected as the prevalent processes in the mutant, encompassing more than 50% of all upregulated proteins. This includes several ribosomal proteins and ribonucleoproteins. Ribosomal proteins L32 (CF317_002712), L36 (CF317_007709), S30 (CF317_005321) and L37 (CF317_004524-T1) and the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (CF317_001622-T1) were among the most upregulated proteins, being present in the mutant at level 8.7 to 3.6 (3.1 to 1.85 log2 fold change) higher than in the wild type (Supplementary Table 10). Increased levels were also observed for proteins involved in RNA metabolic processes and in transcription such as the U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 11 (A0A0D2DFT3_9EURO), the U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm4 (CF317_002219-T1) and the pre-mRNA-splicing factor isy1 (CF317_006097-T1),—partaking in nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA and in pre-mRNA splicing (Zhou et al., 2014)—the transcription factors C2H2 and RfeG (CF317_009591-T1 and CF317_000265-T1) and the 2′-phosphotransferase (CF317_002731-T1). Protein modulation also affected enzymes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation, whose levels resulted to be increased in K. chersonesos Mut, i.e., the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6 (CF317_000645-T1 and CF317_000273-T1), cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 7 (CF317_008279-T1), NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1 alpha subcomplex subunit CF317_000197-T1. Regulation of proteins involved in chemical and stress response was also observed. The histone H2A (CF317_001633-T1)—reported to have a role on DNA repair (Moore et al., 2007)—and the Nuclear transcription factor Y alpha (CF317_006017-T1)—with multiple roles in development and stress response (Zhao et al., 2017)—were found at levels at least 1.6-fold higher than in the melanized counterpart. Conversely, downregulated processes at normal gravity condition prevalently encompassed carbohydrate, lipid and general cellular metabolism (Supplementary Figure 5A). Decreased levels were observed for glycoside hydrolases and esterolytic enzymes including the alpha-galactosidase (CF317_004369-T1) and cutinases (CF317_007621-T1)—levels 9.7- and 7-fold lower than in the wild type—for the glucan 1,3-beta glucosidase (CF317_002004-T1; 1.69-folds decreased) and for the murein transglycosylase (CF317_004960-T1, CF317_003460-T1, CF317_006383-T1; 1.83-, 2- and 4-fold decreased), enzymes responsible for polymers and microbial degradation by cleavage at the peptidoglycan or the cell wall polysaccharides level (Lincoln et al., 1997). Additionally, proteins involved in lipid metabolic process—i.e., acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (CF317_005988-T1), isocitrate lyase (CF317_004212-T1) and lipase (CF317_005885-T1)—and in protein catabolism—i.e., proteasome subunit alpha type (CF317_008861-T1), proteasome endopeptidase complex (CF317_004788-T1) and peptidase S53 domain-containing protein (CF317_005049-T1)—showed decreased levels between 1.8- and 1.5-fold. At the secretome level, the quantitative analysis of K. chersonesos Mut v/s Wt under normal gravity conditions, resulted in the detection of 104 proteins with increased and 87 proteins with decreased abundance in the mutant secretome. Of these proteins, 24% have predicted extracellular localization based on the presence of a signal peptide (Supplementary Table 11). Distribution of over-represented biological process GO terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Supplementary Figure 5B. Most of proteins upregulated in the mutant were involved with carbohydrate metabolism and regulation of biological process (24% of all upregulated proteins), transport (9%), response to stress (8%) and transcription (8%). A number of hydrolases required for the breakdown of β-glucan chains and other cell-wall components— i.e., carboxylic ester hydrolyses (CF317_004653-T1, CF317_008040-T1, CF317_002308-T1, CF317_005799-T1), feruloyl esterase (CF317_002949-T1), alongside glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (CF317_002004-T1), murein transglycosylase (CF317_006383-T1) and cutinase (CF317_007621-T1) which were downregulated in the mutant proteome—were present in the secretome at levels comprised between 1.5- and 4-folds higher than in the wild type (Supplementary Table 11). The same for mannan endo-1,6-alpha-mannosidase (CF317_001276-T1) and chitin deacetylase (CF317_003258-T1), which play multiple roles in the function of the fungal cell wall (Spreghini et al., 2003; Mouyna et al., 2020). In the category transport, the multicopper oxidase (CF317_009669-T1; 1.9-fold), the chloride channel protein (CF317_004136-T; 1.7-folds) and the nitrate/nitrite transporter (CF317_004846-T1; 1.6-fold) represented the most upregulated proteins. Increased levels of stress-response proteins were observed for the Histone H2A protein (CF317_001633-T1; 1.7-fold)—found to be overexpressed also in the mutant proteome—alongside the redox protein thioredoxin (CF317_006109-T1; 1.7-fold), catalase A (CF317_009216-T1; 1.7-fold) and the housekeeping enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase (CF317_007147-T1; 2.3-fold), whose involvement in the signaling pathway of oxidative stresses has been reported (Desorption et al., 2000). Normal gravity condition was also characterized by increased levels of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (CF317_005659-T1), EF-1 gamma subunit (CF317_000379-T1), and alkaline phosphatase (CF317_008227-T1; CF317_003892-T1), all involved in transcription. Conversely, decreased levels were observed in the secretome almost exclusively for proteins involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis (Supplementary Figure 5B). Out of 87 downregulated proteins, more than 50 encompassed ribosomal proteins. Of these, the most downregulated ones— the 60S ribosomal proteins L32 (CF317_006070-T1), L35 (CF317_001879-T1) and L33-A (CF317_005595-T1)—were present at levels below 5-fold than their counterparts in the wild type secretome. Other proteins were prevalently involved in stress/chemical response, e.g., plasma membrane phosphatase (CF317_000051-T1), CipC-like antibiotic response protein (CF317_003991-T1), small heat shock protein (SHSP) domain-containing protein (CF317_001628-T1). These findings pose interesting questions regarding the presence of intracellular proteins in K. chersonesos secretome: while it may be indicative of cell lysis during cultivation, it may also suggest that ribosomal and other non-classical secretory proteins are found in the culture supernatant due to EVs-mediated secretion (Sun and Su, 2019). The co-isolation of these and classical secretory proteins during sample preparation can occur if no prior separation of the vesicle containing fraction from the secretome, is performed (Vallejo et al., 2012).",
    "discussion": "Discussion To date, investigations into the responses of microorganisms to space and Mars-like conditions have been performed with few black fungi species; some of them involved stress simulation in ground-based facilities (Pacelli et al., 2017), while others carried out the exposure of fungal strains inside or outside the International Space Station (Onofri et al., 2012, 2019; Pacelli et al., 2016). With only one exception (Zakharova et al., 2014)—the comparative study of 2D protein patterns under Mars-like conditions—the majority of astrobiological work carried out with black fungi has mainly focused on the analysis of ultrastructural alterations and DNA integrity. Hence, this study represents the first qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to simulated space conditions, i.e., microgravity, which has significance to exobiology and implications to planetary protection policy. In-depth understanding of proteome-related alterations in cell physiology is crucial to gaining new insight into the evolution of extremophiles and the actual limits for life. Further, the comparative analysis of a melanin-deficient mutant and the wild type is important to evaluate the role of melanization in stress survival. Under microgravity conditions, a development toward a more clump-like growth was observed in both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut and may be due to the low shear and low turbulence suspension culture environment created by LSSMG. However, morphological differences were not detected via FE-SEM in cells grown under LSSMG compared to those grown in 1G. This is not surprising, as black fungi reportedly resort to strategies to minimize efforts at both the morphological and physiological level when exposed to stress conditions (Sterflinger, 2006). Microcolonial growth and the switch among different growth forms—i.e., budding and hyphae formation—ensure that these organisms have a lifestyle versatility to cope with a variety of stress in their natural habitats (Sterflinger et al., 1999; Gostinčar et al., 2011). Unaltered morphology upon exposure to LSSMG was previously described in filamentous fungi in both suspension (e.g., Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum) (Sathishkumar et al., 2014) and agar cultures (A. niger, Candida albicans) (Yamazaki et al., 2012), albeit LSSMG-induced phenotypic changes have been to date substantiated by a higher number of studies on fungal species e.g., Pleurotus sp., Candida sp., Cladosporium sp., Ulocladium sp., Basipetospora sp., etc (Miyazaki et al., 2010; Searles et al., 2011; Gomoiu et al., 2013). Interestingly, the sole morphological response to microgravity detected in the present study was the early switch to hyphae formation observed in K. chersonesos Wt (at day 5 instead of day 7, as in normal gravity; Figure 2). This is consistent with previous reports of increased filamentous growth under LSSMG in the opportunistic fungal pathogen C. albicans (Altenburg et al., 2008). The observation of early hyphal development in non-pathogenic species in response to LSSMG is rather suggestive of biofilm formation as a strategy for enhanced resistance to stress and for the forage for nutrients (Searles et al., 2011). Both LSSMG-cultured K. chersonesos Mut and their 1G controls showed extensive cell self-aggregation, i.e., cell clumping and occasional filamentation that are characteristics of black fungi (Nai et al., 2013). Significant variations were also not found in the total cell number, and cell size was not affected by microgravity in both strains (Supplementary Tables 1, 2), unlike what has been documented by studies on a variety of bacteria (Huang et al., 2018) and yeasts (Crabbé et al., 2013). The results of proteomics analysis revealed that exposure to LSSMG altered the proteome and secretome of both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut when compared to the 1G counterparts, having an impact on different pathways. Interestingly, the mutant response mainly involved protein downregulation, which might suggest a general slowing of the metabolic rate (Figure 4B). In contrast, more subtle rearrangements in the protein repertoire were observed in the wild type, especially in the secreted fraction, which possibly reflect a fine-tuning of the regulation of protein expression. Regardless, both strains showed increased abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially at the whole-cell proteome level (Figure 5A). Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism were found to be promoted in the wild type, whereas the glyoxylate shunt, ancillary cycle to TCA cycle and essential for growth on two-carbon compounds (Lorenz and Fink, 2001), was upregulated in the mutant. Similar alterations in carbohydrate metabolism were previously observed in melanotic filamentous fungi exposed to simulated Mars conditions (SMC) or to ISS-conditions (Romsdahl et al., 2018, 2019; Blachowicz et al., 2019a). Here, increased abundance was also observed for several starvation-induced glycoside hydrolases with roles in nutrient acquisition from biopolymers and in the recycling of cell wall components to support cell maintenance. Starvation response was thereby suggested as crucial adaptation to space conditions, especially oligotrophy. Conversely, one characteristic of both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut was decreased levels of glycoside hydrolases and cell wall–degradation enzymes such as the endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (CF317_0009683-T1) and the extracellular cell wall glucanase Crf1 (CF317_009779-T1). The same was observed for carbohydrate-active enzymes like cutinases and for lipases at both the proteome and the secretome level, which suggests that, under space conditions, black fungi opt for strategies different than those adopted by filamentous fungi. GO analysis and pathways prediction further revealed upregulation of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) and in the metabolism of phospho- and glycerophospholipids. This may be explained by modifications in membrane lipid composition aimed at maintaining membranes stability against stress (Xia et al., 2019). More specifically, an LSSMG-dependent increase in membrane fluidity attributable to a higher USFA/SFA ratio was previously demonstrated by studies in plain lipid membranes, various microorganisms e.g., Escherichia coli and plants upon exposure to microgravity (Sieber et al., 2014; Kim and Rhee, 2016; Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Potentially, this could affect the function of membrane-integrated proteins, thereby leading to altered transporter activity. Whether the activity of uptake transporters is altered in microgravity conditions is currently unknown (Eyal and Derendorf, 2019). However, similarly to what was observed in other fungi e.g., C. albicans (Crabbé et al., 2013) and bacteria e.g., Bacillus subtilis (Morrison et al., 2019) in space, K. chersonesos Wt and Mut ion-channels and integral membrane proteins were found to be upregulated. The increased abundance of specific transporters generally maximizes the uptake of nutrients (e.g., phosphate and nitrogen). As such, it possibly represents an adaptive response to temporary starvation caused either by zones of nutrient depletion developing around the colony or by the partial loss of contact of the cells with the culture medium, which may occur under microgravity conditions (Mazars et al., 2014; Senatore et al., 2018). Other types of transporters—i.e., ammonium transporters and permeases for transmembrane amino acid transport—could provide a link between nitrogen assimilation and proteins synthesis (Martzivanou et al., 2006). Indeed, upregulation of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolic processes was recorded under LSSMG conditions, but a higher number of these proteins was found to be decreased, especially in the mutant proteome. Decreases in the levels of structural ribosomal proteins involved in cytoplasmic translation (i.e., L23a, L37a, and L34) and of the poly(A)polymerase, as well as the increase in RNA degrading ribonuclease T1, were additionally detected in microgravity. Together, the regulation of these proteins may suggest that protein translation via ribosomal translational machinery is reduced upon exposure to LSSMG, a phenomenon that has been indicated as a widespread response to microgravity, space, and Mars-like conditions not only in fungi (Sheehan et al., 2007; Willaert, 2013; Feger et al., 2016; Kamal et al., 2018, 2019; Blachowicz et al., 2019a). Remarkably, in our study, a decrease in translation and ribosome biogenesis was only observed in the wild type whole-cell proteome and, to a minor extent, in the mutant secretome (Figure 5B). However, ribosomes are very dynamic organelles and additional tests will be needed to confirm that the 2-fold regulation of the above-mentioned proteins is actually indicative of reduced protein synthesis under microgravity. In a similar fashion, proteins taking part in functional organization of cell organelles and cytoskeleton—for which a wide spectrum of microgravity-dependent changes has been reported (Zhang et al., 2015)—showed opposite regulation in the wild type and the mutant. The same was observed in the secretome for the DNA-repair Histone H2A and the scytalone dehydratase, the latter involved in the biosynthesis of DNH melanin from endogenous substrate (Eisenman and Casadevall, 2012), which were upregulated in the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. This is suggestive of increased measures for cell protection and is in line with the fact that melanin pigmentation and enhanced melanin synthesis is most often a feature of fungi living on space stations (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; De Middeleer et al., 2019). Further, versicolorin reductase (CF317_003229-T1), a protein mediating aflatoxins biosynthetic processes, was also decreased only in the mutant. Although production of aflatoxins in K. chersonesos has hitherto not been reported, this finding can be indicative of reduced production of allergenic or toxic metabolites (e.g., polyketides). Also in the mutant, the upregulation of hydrolytic enzymes such as the alpha, alpha-trehalase suggests a recourse to store carbohydrates as a carbon source. By contrast, production of compounds that increase the osmotolerancy (e.g., trehalose) represents a quite common protective measure implemented by microorganisms under microgravity and other types of stress (Willaert, 2013). Opposite protein regulation was especially evident when examining the top 10 proteins differentially regulated in both strains at all experimental conditions, which included several ribosomal proteins (Supplementary Figure 3). These discrepancies suggest that strategies to cope with suboptimal conditions of growth may be strain-specific and that diverse rearrangements of proteome repertoire are possibly related to the presence or absence of melanin in the cell wall. Indeed, differences between wild type and mutant proteomic profiles were even observed at normal gravity condition. Proteins involved in translation, transcription and RNA metabolic process were significantly more upregulated in the mutant proteome than in the wild type (up to 9-fold, as in the case of ribosomal proteins L32, L36, S30 and L37), whereas the mutant secretome showed increased abundance of a number of hydrolases required for the breakdown of biopolymers and cell wall components (Supplementary Figure 5). A number of proteins differentially expressed under simulated microgravity were involved in stress response, including glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; CF317_004755-T1) and nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD; CF317_006388-T1), over-represented in the proteome of both fungi, and chemical stress component proteins with proteolytic and phosphatase activity. While its role as a stress-responsive enzyme was speculated for GDH (i.e., ROS) (Skopelitis et al., 2006), NOD participates in mechanisms of detoxification of nitric oxide, a gas with multiple roles in cellular metabolism ranging from defense to signaling. The observation of peptidases, which were enriched in K. chersonesos Wt proteome under exposure to LSSMG, may instead suggest the removal of damaged proteins to enhance cellular fitness and maximize survival (Bonham-Carter et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). In this respect, it should be noted that a role of altered gravity in the breakdown of protein structures has been previously reported (Trotter et al., 2015). However, a major part of detected stress response proteins involved in cell redox homeostasis, glutathione metabolism and recycling and osmotic stress defense—i.e., catalases, glutathione reductases, 3-phytases and s-formylglutathione hydrolases—appeared to be decreased under exposure to LSSMG. As previously suggested in plants (Zhang et al., 2015), downregulation of general stress response proteins under microgravity might indicate an impaired activation of the defense response components. However, decreased levels of common stress proteins and lack of a heat shock response (HSP) represent a key component of black fungi response to a variety of suboptimal conditions of growth and have been attributed to an energy-saving strategy that relies on a fine-tuning regulation of protein abundance (Tesei et al., 2012, 2015; Zakharova et al., 2013, 2014; Blasi et al., 2017). One further interesting aspect was the high number of proteins traditionally recognized as cytoplasmic in K. chersonesos secretome, especially in the mutant (i.e., 6% of total secreted proteins with predicted signal peptide v/s 25% in the wild type; 20% of regulated secreted proteins had signal peptides in both strains). Such a discrepancy between wild type and mutant was also reported in a study of K. chersonesos secretome aimed at the screening for novel polyesterases (Tesei et al., 2020), hence it seems to suggest that a low number of extracellular proteins may be a peculiarity of the mutant secretome. The presence of cytoplasmic proteins in the culture supernatant may indicate that the mutant is more prone to cell lysis than the wild type (Miura and Ueda, 2018). However, given that proteins with no signal peptide (leaderless) can also be found in the secreted fraction as a result of non-classical protein secretion, e.g., via EVs-mediated pathways (Vallejo et al., 2012; Sun and Su, 2019), it may as well indicate co-isolation of vesicle proteins and classical secretory proteins during sample preparation procedures. These proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, signaling, cell division and transport, etc.), for which vesicular transport might be the only route of extracellular delivery, are generally predicted as non-secretory (Bleackley et al., 2019). Together, the aspects of protein modulation observed in K. chersonesos Wt and Mut suggest that the basic energy metabolism was upregulated in the Wt strain. Here, rearrangements of the protein repertoire resembled the classic response to microgravity, but with no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response. The mutant mostly engaged in protein downregulation, without affecting their cell growth and survivability. This study therefore indicates the ability of black fungi to cope with microgravity conditions and suggests that cell wall melanization may ultimately influence the metabolic response to microgravity. Point mutation will be needed to confirm whether mutagenesis played a role in protein downregulation in K. chersonesos Mut. To further our understanding about the impact of microgravity on ribosome biogenesis and protein translation, future work shall involve proteomics workflows such as radio-labeled protein expression assays.",

Copyright notice ID: 8012687 PMID: 33815472 Abstract Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions. Keywords: microgravity, black fungi, extremophiles, secretomics, proteomics, astrobiology, Knufia chersonesos (syn. K. petricola)Introduction Based on their nature as settlers in extreme environments, microbial extremophiles are of great interest to studies aiming to elucidate stress adaptation and survival mechanisms. Successful examples of extremophiles can be found in the fungal domain, alongside bacteria, and archaea, which for a long time were considered to be the sole colonizers of habitats previously considered uninhabitable. Some of these fungal extremophiles show even higher resistance than that of prokaryotes (Shtarkman et al., 2013; Aguilera and González-Toril, 2019). Black fungi in particular represent a group of highly melanized microfungi, whose ability to survive in a variety of extreme environments has in recent decades attracted increasing attention (Selbmann et al., 2005; Sterflinger, 2006; Gorbushina, 2007; Onofri et al., 2007). Desiccation, low nutrient availability, excessive radiation, extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH are some of the multiple sources of stress characterizing the habitats where these organisms have been shown to thrive (Gunde-Cimerman et al., 2000, 2003; Selbmann et al., 2008). The highest diversity of black fungi has especially been observed in rocky environments, ranging from mountain summits to the Atacama Desert and the Antarctic cold regions (Gonçalves et al., 2016; Ametrano et al., 2019). Rock represents a harsh habitat and a quite ancient niche for life, believed to reflect early Earth conditions, and thus considered to be a model for extraterrestrial life (Selbmann et al., 2014). The discovery of melanized fungi in extreme environments has prompted researchers to investigate microbial physiology at the absolute edges of adaptability, aiming at a deeper understanding of the limits for life (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; Tesei et al., 2012; Zakharova et al., 2013). Other studies have focused on testing fungal survival in space conditions through simulations in ground-based facilities or in space missions that enabled the assessment of the habitability of extraterrestrial environments and, hence, the possibility of life beyond Earth (Scalzi et al., 2012; Onofri et al., 2019). Space and outer space conditions are by definition hostile, as they include enhanced irradiation, microgravity, and temperature extremes (Rabbow et al., 2012, 2017; Senatore et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the isolation of melanized fungi from spacecraft and space stations—e.g., the International Space Station (ISS)—has been reported frequently (Checinska et al., 2015; Checinska-Sielaff et al., 2019). In this respect, a number of studies have examined the molecular adaptations of ISS-isolated strains to space conditions, showing alterations in metabolome and proteome (Knox et al., 2016; Blachowicz et al., 2019b; Romsdahl et al., 2019). Investigations of microbial survival in space are therefore relevant also in the context of space missions, to prevent contaminations and to develop strategies to reduce hazard, especially in the case of opportunistic species (Urbaniak et al., 2019). In black fungi, astrobiological studies have evaluated the potential effects of Mars or ISS conditions on fungal viability and metabolism. One investigation revealed that a rock isolate from Antarctica, Cryomyces minteri, could survive simulated Martian atmosphere and pressure, temperature fluctuations between −20 and 20°C, ultraviolet radiation, and vacuum (Onofri et al., 2008). Comparative 2D-PAGE proteomics was carried out for other rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) (i.e., Cryomyces antarcticus, Knufia perforans, and Exophiala jeanselmei) exposed to these conditions and showed a decrease in protein complexity, followed by recovery of the metabolic activity after 1 week of exposure (Zakharova et al., 2014). Further, survivability of C. antarcticus in outer space was shown via colony counts following a 1.5-year-long exposure on board the EXPOSE-E facility of the ISS (Onofri et al., 2012). A more recent experiment of C. antarcticus exposure on rock analogs under space and simulated Martian conditions revealed only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage and pointed out the high stability of DNA within melanized cells (Pacelli et al., 2016). In other investigations, the resistance to acute ionizing radiations was demonstrated in RIF (Pacelli et al., 2017, 2018). Together, these studies have revealed the ability of rock-colonizing black fungi to endure space conditions; however, to date, reports that specifically evaluate the response to microgravity have not been produced. Microgravity is an important factor influencing microbial life in space environments, a condition in which the gravity level is almost zero but not neutralized. Due to the technological and logistical hurdles linked to studies of microgravity in space, different methods have been developed to simulate microgravity and analyze microbial responses (Herranz et al., 2013). Accordingly, the term low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) is used to describe the environmental condition created by these devices, resembling the low-shear effects of the fluid on the cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2014). Spaceflight and ground-based microgravity analog experiments have suggested that microgravity can affect microbial gene expression, cell morphology, physiology, and metabolism, also triggering increased virulence in pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Altenburg et al., 2008; Taylor, 2015; Sathishkumar et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Although the effects of microgravity on microbes have been studied for several years, only the responses of a few typical prokaryotic and eukaryotic model organisms—e.g., Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp.—have hitherto been investigated (Huang et al., 2018). Hence, studying the reaction of black fungi to microgravity holds potential for the elucidation of the molecular basis of tolerance in extremotolerant and extremophilic fungi, and can also contribute to unearthing the biological uniqueness of these species and their adaptability to space conditions. In the present study, the qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to LSSMG was carried out for the first time. The rock-associated Knufia chersonesos (syn. Knufia petricola) was selected as the model organism due to its reported poikilo-tolerance, e.g., the ability to endure xeric conditions, desiccation, high UV-radiation and temperatures (Sterflinger et al., 2012) and to feed on alternative carbon sources like monoaromatic compounds (Nai et al., 2013) and synthetic polyesters (Tesei et al., 2020). K. chersonesos aptitude to withstand levels of gaseous ozone up to 11 ppm was also shown (Tesei et al., unpublished). Furthermore, being the only black fungus known to have a melanin-deficient spontaneous mutant (Tesei et al., 2017), K. chersonesos allows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the stress-protective role of melanin. Cultures of K. chersonesos wild type and mutant were grown in HARVs and analyzed for changes at the proteome—whole-cell proteome (mycelia) and secretome (culture supernatant)—and at the morphological level, with an eye toward the impact of cell-wall melanization on the physiological response to the stress.Materials and Methods Fungal Strains The fungal strains used in this study included the non-pathogenic rock-inhabiting fungus K. chersonesos MA5789 wild type (Wt) and MA5790 mutant (Mut), both obtained from the ACBR fungal culture collection of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria. The Wt, characterized by a highly melanized mycelium, was isolated from red sandstone in Ny London, Svalbard, Norway. The pink mutant, whose pigmentation is due to unmasking of carotenoids resulting from the lack of melanin, originated spontaneously under laboratory conditions (Tesei et al., 2017). K. chersonesos (syn. K. petricola) is an emerging model organism for analyses aiming at the elucidation of the rock-lifestyle and RIF physiology (Nai et al., 2013). Along with its ascertained thermo-, pH-, UV- and desiccation tolerance (Gorbushina et al., 2008; Sterflinger et al., 2012), the fungus was recently reported to have an aptitude for using synthetic polymers as an alternative carbon source (Tesei et al., 2020). These features and the ability to endure high levels of gaseous ozone (Tesei et al., unpublished), altogether make K. chersonesos particularly suited for astrobiology studies. Further, the availability of a mutant strain allows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the role of melanin in stress protection. Fungal cultures were maintained in flasks containing 50 mL of 2% malt extract broth (MEB, pH 5, 2% malt extract, 2% glucose, 1% peptone) at 21°C with shaking at 63 rpm (Innova, Eppendorf). Cultures at exponential phase were used for inoculation of media for all experiments.Exposure to Low-Shear Simulated Microgravity (LSSMG) Fungal pellets were obtained from 5-day-old cultures by centrifugation, washed in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently mildly ribolyzed (3 × 20”, speed 4; MP Biomedicals) to separate cells. As clump-like growth is an inherent characteristic of black fungi, mechanical disruption of cell clusters is a prerequisite for both inoculation of cultures and cell counting (Voigt et al., 2020). Following the cell count (Neubauer), the cell number was adjusted to the initial concentration of 2 × 105 ml–1 with 10 mL fresh 2% MEB and used as seed culture. High-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs; Synthecon Inc) were filled with the cell suspensions (10 mL) and rotated at 30 rpm (initial rotation rate) in the vertical axis to provide LSSMG conditions inside a chamber with 60% humidity and 22°C, for 7 days. Control runs were set up by rotating the bioreactors in the horizontal axis to provide normal gravity condition (1G) (Rosenzweig et al., 2010; Kim and Rhee, 2016). During cultivation, the rotation speed was adjusted to 43 rpm in order to keep the cells pellets orbiting within the vessel in continual fall and to prevent their contact with the vessel walls (Figures 1A,B). A total of two biological replicates were maintained throughout the experiments. An additional set of experiments identical to the conditions mentioned above was established for measurement of cell concentration and microscope observations. Cell concentration was assessed via hemocytometer count at different time points until completion of the experiment, using two biological replicates (i.e., biomass from two different vessels) for each experimental condition. Following removal of the vessel from the rotator base, samples of cells were collected under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood using a luer-lock syringe and the syringe port in the culture vessel. The sampling was carried out one vessel at a time while the remaining vessels were kept rotating on the rotator base. Cell survivability at the end of the LSSMG exposure was assessed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFU) using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012), according to Choudhry (2016). FIGURE 1.

The HARVs provide oxygenation via a flat, silicon rubber gas transfer membrane located at the base of the vessel and directly underneath the cultures.Microscopy Studies Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) For SEM studies, samples from the two strains were collected from all the established cultures—LSSMG and normal gravity condition (1G)—at various timepoints, i.e., 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. A 1:10 dilution of each sample was prepared using 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and thereafter transferred onto electron microscopy coupons. For each sample, two biological replicates (and two technical replicates each i.e., aliquots of 20 μl) were prepared and let dry at 35°C before examination. A Sirion (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, United States) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used for examination of the fungal cells. No specimen preparation procedures, such as sample coating with a surface-conducting (carbon or metal) layer, were performed as they were not necessary when using the FE-SEM. The samples were analyzed using an acceleration voltage of 10–20 kV, beam current of 40–50 mA and positioning the detector 6–10 mm away from the coupon. Secondary electron images were acquired in the high-vacuum mode. For each sample coupon, a minimum of 10 fields was observed, and images were acquired with various magnification (100×–5,000×).Fluorescence Microscopy For the cell integrity and viability assay, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and propidium iodide (PI) in combination with SYTO 9 were used. The carbohydrate-binding lectin WGA has a known affinity for β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligomers present in the fungal polysaccharide chitin. PI, a membrane impermeant dye that is generally excluded from viable cells, was applied together with the nuclear and chromosome counterstain SYTO 9 for a dead/live stain. 200 μl aliquots were collected from all the established cultures after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. Fungal cells were washed twice in 1X PBS and suspended in 500 μl. Following a 1:10 dilution, 100 μl cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate of WGA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 15 μl of FungaLight containing equal amounts of PI and SYTO 9 solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The chosen amounts of the fluorescent probes are justified by the thickening and the increase in melanization of the cell walls, which hindered the staining process. Cell suspensions were mounted over glass slides and analyzed under an Axioplane microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Carl Zeiss). For each sample, two technical replicates were prepared for observation.Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-Based Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics Sample Preparation The content of each vessel was spun at 7500 × g (5810, Eppendorf) and at 4°C for 15 min to separate fungal cell pellet (mycelium) from culture supernatant (secretome). Protease inhibitors (10 μl:1 mL v/v, Halt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were thereafter added—and mixed with 1 mL 1 × PBS in the case of biomass samples—and samples were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction. Proteins were extracted as previously described by Romsdahl et al. (2018) with some modifications. In brief, 1 mL lysis buffer consisting of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to fungal cell pellets (i.e., ∼0.5 g) and culture supernatants (i.e., ∼0.5 mL), the latter previously concentrated in a SpeedVac system. Sample homogenization was achieved using a bead beater (Bertin) at 4°C (3 × 5500 rpm for 1 min., with 15 s. breaks in between) and following centrifugation at 17,000 × g and 4°C for 15 min, protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein extracts were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). For each sample, 250 μg proteins were precipitated in 20% TCA at 4°C, reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA), and digested with Trypsin/LysC (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) overnight at 37°C. Peptide quantitation was performed using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteomic and secretomic profiling of K. chersonesos Wt and Mut were carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. A total of 40 μg peptides from each cell pellet sample or 13 μg peptides from each culture supernatant were labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMT10 plex (TMT10) Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit according to the manufacturer protocol. Eight TMT tags were used to label samples from the same experimental set. The TMT10-131 label was used as a reference that contained a pool of 5 μg of peptides from all samples. All nine labeled-peptide samples were combined into a single tube, mixed and fractionated using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and dissolved in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.LC-MS/MS Analysis The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system, a 300 μm × 5 mm PepMap100 C18 precolumn, a 75 μm × 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (5 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (1 min), 90% solvent B (1 min), and 90% to 3% solvent B (3 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (400–1,600 m/z) was acquired in the orbitrap at a resolution of 240,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4 × 105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2–7 within a ± 10 ppm mass window using a 60 s dynamic exclusion. The MS2 scan (400–1,200 m/z) was performed using the linear ion trap with the CID collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 1 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 30 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were then simultaneously selected for an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (100–500 m/z) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000 and using HCD at a collision energy setting of 65%, an AGC target of 5 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 54 ms.Quantitative Proteomics Analysis All MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against an in-house annotated draft genome sequence of K. chersonesos MA5789 Wt (GCA_002319055.1, assembly ASM231905v1, ) (Tesei et al., 2017) consisting of 9.818 predicted protein coding gene models. The genome was annotated using funannotate (v1.3.4) (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1284502), which combined predictions from ab initio gene predictors with Augustus trained by BUSCO gene models (fungi_odb9) (Zdobnov et al., 2017) and GeneMark.hmm (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008) informed by protein evidence from Swiss-Prot (Boutet et al., 2007) together into composite gene models with EvidenceModeler (Haas et al., 2008). Functional predictions for genes was assigned by protein homology to Pfam (El-gebali et al., 2019), Swiss-Prot/UniProt (v 2018_05), and EggNog (v1.10) databases (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019). The following parameters were selected for the search: A maximum of two missed cleavage sites, a minimum peptide length of six residues, 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses, and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of protein N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co-isolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The quantitative abundance of each protein was determined from the total intensity of the detected reporter ions. For statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was log2 transformed, and the technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide and quantified in all technical (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2), were considered for the statistical analysis. Student’s t-test was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins between each LSSMG-exposed and 1G-exposed group as well as between all groups. To compare all four experimental conditions, each condition was normalized to the reference channel, which contained equal amounts of peptides from each group. To evaluate changes between treatment (LSSMG) and control (1G), the protein abundance levels of each LSSMG-exposed sample were normalized to the 1G-exposed counterpart. Proteins with p-values of ≤0.05 were further evaluated for increased or decreased abundance using a cut-off value of ≥ ± 1.5-fold change (log2 fold change of ≥ ± 0.584).Protein Identification and Bioinformatics Analysis Protein identifications and functional insights were obtained from searching for sequence homologs using OmicsBox v. 1.4.11 (BioBam Bioinformatics S.L). To characterize proteins with respect to the biological process they are involved in, Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to domains. The sequences were blasted (cloud BLASTP 2.10.0+, E-Value 1.0E-3, Filter: Fungi), and the blast hits were mapped and annotated with GOs using the GO database (Goa version 2019_111; E-Value 1.0E-6, Filter GO by Taxonomy: taxa: 4751, Fungi) (Götz et al., 2008). GOs were additionally assigned using InterProScan (IPS) to retrieve domains/motif information in a sequence-wise manner, and EggNOG using precomputed EggNOG-based orthology assignments. Corresponding GOs were then transferred to the sequences and merged with already existing GO terms. The annotations were validated based on the True-Path-Rule by removing all redundant terms to a given sequence. A GO-Slim analysis was run to summarize the GO annotation using the Aspergillus slim. Existing GO terms were additionally mapped to enzymes codes, when possible. A pathway analysis was performed to retrieve metabolic pathways based on the GO terms and the enzyme codes using the Load KEGG Pathway tool (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). To elucidate the identity of the uncharacterized proteins, a search for homology was further performed in the UniProtKB database2 (BLASTP parameters: E-Threshold: 10; matrix BLOSUM62). In cases of blast results where the most significant match was represented by an uncharacterized protein, the first match in the list of homologous proteins where a protein ID was available was considered. Information about the predicted protein localization was obtained using BUSCA3, based on the identification of signal and transit peptides, GPI-anchors and alpha-helical and beta-stranded transmembrane domains (Savojardo et al., 2018). Protein-protein interaction analyses were performed using STRING v11.0 with high confidence (0.70) (Jensen et al., 2009), selecting the proteome of the black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis as reference database based on its phylogenetic proximity to K. chersonesos (Tesei et al., 2020).Results Growth Behavior Cell concentration in the LSSMG-exposed and unexposed samples was measured via hemocytometer at four different time points: (1) start (seed, day 0), (2) acceleration phase (in between lag and exponential phases, day 3), (3) exponential phase (day 5) and (4) at the end of the experiment (stationary phase, day 7). In K. chersonesos WtLSSMG, ∼23.5-fold increase in cell concentration was observed during acceleration phase when compared to the original inoculum (2 × 105 cells/mL). Such an increase during acceleration phase was also noticed in K. chersonesos MutLSSMG (10-fold), K. chersonesos Wt1G (22-fold) and K. chersonesos Mut1G (19-fold). During stationary phase the increase in cell concentration was 28-fold (K. chersonesos WtLSSMG), 30-fold (K. chersonesos MutLSSMG), 42-fold (K. chersonesos Wt1G), and 36-fold (K. chersonesos Mut1G) when compared to original inoculum. Among LSSMG and Earth gravity grown cultures, higher values were recorded at normal gravity condition. Overall, only ∼one log growth in 7 days might be due to the clumping nature of Knufia cells. Cell survivability in simulated microgravity was measured by CFU using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012) according to established protocol (Choudhry, 2016) and were: K. chersonesos WtLSSMG = 2.8 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos MutLSSMG 2.5 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos Wt1G 2.6 × 106 cell/mL, K. chersonesos Mut1G 2.3 × 106 cell/mL (Supplementary Table 1). Potential mechanical damages or cell lysis caused by cell separation via mild bead beating (i.e., ribolyzer, 3 × 20 s, speed 4) prior to cell count are to be excluded since optical microscope observations and tests involving repeated bead beater treatments indicated that it does not decrease cell viability. However, underestimation of cell survivability by CFU due to cell clumping, an inherent characteristic of black fungi, should be taken into account. Under LSMMG conditions, fungal cells showed an increased clumping, resulting in the aggregation of cells to form a mycelial growth in the center of the vessel. However, growth morphology under Earth gravity resembled a biofilm of cells adhering to the vessel’s oxygenation membrane (Figure 1C).Microscopy To evaluate the presence of LSSMG-dependent alterations of fungal cell morphology in the melanotic (Wt) and non-melanized spontaneous mutant (Mut) strain, we examined cellular differentiation by growing cells at low density. In order to analyze single cellular morphology of the Wt and Mut strain before LSSMG-treatment, exponentially growing fungal cells were spotted on top of aluminum coupons and visualized using FE-SEM. The observation of the control fungal cell morphology in non-coated FE-SEM specimens revealed that the Wt produced biconcave cells, pseudohyphae and hyphae, while the mutant showed smooth spherical cells, pseudohyphae and cell aggregates (Figures 2, 3). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) micrographs of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut on aluminum coupons during a 7-days exposure to LSSMG or 1G (control). Arrows indicate hyphal growth in the wild type and dense cell aggregation in the mutant strain.FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab FE-SEM micrographs of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut on aluminum coupons during a 7-days exposure to LSSMG or 1G (control). Details of cells morphology are shown; arrows indicate biconcave cell morphology.Low-shear simulated microgravity-exposed and 1G-exposed fungal cells were collected at various time points, as described in the section “Materials and Methods.” A detailed examination of fungal cellular morphology in non-coated FE-SEM specimens revealed 1G and LSSMG Wt and mutant strains showing similar morphology at day 1 and 3. Remarkably, the 1G Wt hyphae formation was delayed until day 7, whereas LSSMG induced hyphae formation at day 5 (Figure 2). Notably, the mutant showed no evidence of hyphae formation in LSSMG condition, but the aggregation of cells was evident at day 3 and increased until day 7, similarly to what was observed in the 1G cells (Figure 2). Furthermore, a closer observation of Wt and mutant fungal cells in LSSMG and 1G condition at 2500× magnification clearly shows that the Wt cells form biconcave morphology compared to the mutant cells (Figure 3). LSSMG treatment led to no significant change in cell size relative to 1G conditions, in either strain (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, images of PI-SYTO 9 and WGA staining generated by confocal microscopy did not reveal changes in cell viability and integrity in response to LSSMG exposure. Greatest fluorescence was seen with WGA at the beginning of the cultivation, although increasing concentrations of the dye were applied; this is most probably due to the thickening of the cell wall and increase of melanization, which naturally occurs in the fungus over the course of cultivation (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, these findings uncover that the LSSMG and 1G conditions did not influence the fungal cellular growth and morphology.Overview of Whole-Cell Proteome and Secretome Analysis The 16 samples, comprised of four experimental conditions with two biological replicates each for each of the analyzed strains, yielded 3777 proteins as detected by isobaric TMT labeling-based LC-MS/MS. Of these, 3177 were in the whole-cell proteome and 600 in the secreted fraction. Furthermore, 2602 proteins were unique to the proteome and 25 to the secretome, while 575 were found to overlap (Figure 4A). A total of 3163 were identified by homology search. An overview of the biological and molecular functions of the detected proteins was obtained through an annotation statistics analysis. Distribution of the GO terms for all 3 categories (i.e., biological process BP, molecular function MF, and cellular component CC), with the highest number of associated protein sequences in the whole-cell proteome and the secretome, is displayed in Supplementary Figures 2A,B. Several GOs were common to proteome and secretome, whereas others were instead unique to each set of proteins. GOs for different types of cell metabolic processes were the most represented in both secretory and intracellular proteins, whereas BPs such as response to chemical, cell cycle, and negative regulation of cellular processes were found exclusively within the latter. Conversely, proteins involved in cell communication and positive regulation of cellular process could solely be detected in the secreted fraction of the proteome. Proteins with hydrolase activity (MF GO:0016787) represented the most abundant group in the secretome and second most abundant in the whole-cell proteome, immediately followed by proteins with organic cyclic and heterocyclic compound binding, oxidoreductase and transferase activity. In both sets of samples, proteins with transcription and translation regulation activity were instead detected as the smallest groups. A distribution analysis for cellular component GO terms indicated a prevalence of intracellular, membrane, and cell wall proteins (i.e., CC GO: envelope) also in the culture supernatant—i.e., the ratio of total proteins with predicted extracellular to intracellular localization was approximately 25%:75% in the wild type and 6%:94% in the mutant—where the detection of cytoplasmic proteins is possibly due to mechanical stress and cell death (Miura and Ueda, 2018). Nonetheless, the presence of these proteins in the secreted fraction could also depend on active secretion of proteins with no predicted signal peptide, i.e., non-classical protein secretion, which has been recognized in various organisms including fungi, bacteria and plants based on the large number of leaderless proteins detected in extracellular compartments, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Regente et al., 2012; Vallejo et al., 2012; Sun and Su, 2019). The 25 proteins uniquely detected in the secretome encompassed a number of carboxylic ester hydrolases with predicted extracellular localization alongside cytoplasmic, cell wall– and plasma membrane-associated proteins (Supplementary Table 3). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Proteins identified and detected as regulated in the whole-cell proteome and secretome of Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut following exposure to LSSMG. (A) Overlap of proteins between whole-cell proteome and secretome, identified in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. (B) Number of differentially abundant proteins for each strain under LSSMG compared to 1G (control) (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05). (C) Heat map hierarchical clustering of co-varying proteins quantified in each strain. The color key indicates the values that represented the protein abundance ratio (log2) and the number of proteins counted in each value. A total of 6 runs – 3 technical replicates and 2 biological replicates – were performed for each sample. Wt, wild type; Mut, mutant; w-cp, whole-cell proteome; s, secretome. Heatmaps were generated using R.In order to detect significant rearrangements in the protein pool upon exposure to LSSMG, a quantitative analysis was carried out by comparing experimental groups. The clustering of the samples, biological and technical replicates included, was confirmed by Hierarchical Cluster (HC) analysis (Figure 4C). However, one of the LSSMG-exposed secretomes from K. chersonesos Wt appeared to deviate from the biological duplicate of the same condition. The number of differentially abundant proteins for each strain is summarized in Figure 4 (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05), where (B) shows the count of regulated proteins following direct comparison of treatment and control whole-cell proteome and secretome samples. The mutant proteome contained the largest number of modulated proteins (115) compared to the mutant secretome (71), the wild type proteome (97), and the wild type secretome (11).Effects of LSSMG on Knufia chersonesos Whole-Cell Proteome The proteomic quantitative analysis of LSSMG-exposed K. chersonesos Wt and Mut revealed 54-up and 43-down and 45-up and 70-down regulated proteins, respectively, when compared to the 1G-exposed counterparts (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 4, 5). Distribution of over-represented BP GO terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Figure 5A. Most significantly upregulated biological processes included “lipid and carbohydrate metabolism” in both strains (24 to 28% of all upregulated proteins). However, 15% of downregulated proteins were also in the carbohydrate metabolism category. By contrast, proteins involved in lipid metabolic processes were not found to be decreased. Further, “transcription” (12%) and “transport” (27%) were additional highly represented categories of upregulated proteins in the wild type, whereas “transport” (28%) and “amino acid metabolic process” (16%) were well represented categories of upregulated proteins in the mutant. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Biological processes GOs categories of differentially expressed proteins in Knufia chersonesos under LSSMG. (A) Whole-cell proteome (B) Secretome. Proteins with changed abundance (FC ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) were annotated with terms representing various biological processes using OmicsBox v. 1.4.11 (https://www.biobam.com). GO terms were thereafter summarized using sequence distribution/GO multilevel pie charts (Filtered by sequence count, Cutoff = 2).Proteins involved in lipid metabolism included CF317_002955-T1/C7ZGD6_NECH7—predicted to be phospholipase A2—an acetyl-CoA desaturase (CF317_004579-T1/A0A072PJ62_9EURO) and the uncharacterized protein CF317_000532-T1/A0A0D2C8U2_9EURO upregulated in both strains, along with an inositol-3-phosphate synthase (CF317_006213-T1/A0A0D2GI50_9EURO), which was instead solely observed in the mutant. These proteins participate in cellular pathways for the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (KEGG pathway 01040) and the metabolism of phospho- and glycerophospholipids (KEGG 00564), inositol phosphate (KEGG 00562), arachidonic and linoleic acid, among others (Table 1; Passoth, 2017). Pyruvate metabolism (KEGG 00620), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (KEGG 00010) and starch and sucrose metabolism, were possibly also involved in the response to LSSMG, as revealed by the KEGG pathway analysis based on the increased abundance of proteins like alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (CF317_005767-T1/A0A0N0NIW7_9EURO) and alpha/beta-glucosidase agdC (CF317_006579-T1/A0A178BWA1_9EURO) in the wild type. Glutamine synthetase and protein FYV10, the first involved in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (KEGG 00630) and in nitrogen metabolism (Zhang et al., 2017) and the latter mediating the degradation of enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway (Braun et al., 2011), were instead detected as upregulated in the mutant. Decreased levels of a number of hydrolytic enzymes destined for secretion were observed in the LSSMG-exposed proteomes for the carboxylic ester hydrolases CF317_0002308-T1/A0A1J9RJA8_9PEZI, CF317_007618-T1/A0A6A6HNE7_9PEZI, CF317_007621-T1/A0A0D2AG04_9PEZI (in Wt) and CF317_002086-T1/A0A0D2BHT9_9EURO (in Mut). The same was observed for the cell wall–degradation enzymes endo- and extracellular glucanases CF317_0009683-T1/W9ZBZ7_9EURO and CF317_009779-T1/H6BQE2_EXODN (in Wt) and the 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase CF317_000932-T1/A0A1C1D1N7_9EURO (in Mut), the latter of which is involved in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in beta oxidation (Janssen et al., 1994).

number in the K. chersonesos database of ab initio translated proteins.A differential abundance of proteins involved in transport was also observed (Table 1). Transmembrane ammonium (CF317_007500-T1/A0A072PWW7_9EURO) and iron transporters (i.e., HemS domain-containing protein CF317_008807-T1/L7HNA7_MAGOY) and the choline transport protein (CF317_009191-T1/A0A2P8A4S9_9PEZI) were present in the LSSMG-exposed whole-cell proteome of both strains, but they were more increased in the mutant (over 3-, 2. 4-, and 1.5-folds, respectively) than in the wild type (slightly over 1.5-folds). Additionally, two AA permease 2 domain-containing proteins (CF317_005369-T1/A0A0D2FEL3_9EURO and CF317_002132-T1/A0A438N399_EXOME) responsible for transmembrane amino acid transport were also upregulated in the mutant, whereas proteins with a predicted role in vesicle-mediated transport—i.e., VPS37 C-terminal domain-containing protein (CF317_007988-T1/A0A0D2CPQ3_9EURO) and WD_REPEATS_REGION domain-containing protein (CF317_001709-T1/A0A438MTR2_EXOME)—were exclusively detected in the wild type counterpart. Downregulated proteins included POT family proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (CF317_001542-T1/A0A072P870_9EURO) and major facilitator superfamily transporters (MFS) (CF317_001911-T1/W9Z1V7_9EURO), involved in transportation of substrate molecules, including sugars, drugs, metabolites, amino acids, vitamins, and both organic and inorganic ions, or small peptides (Pao and Paulsen, 1998). Together with ABC transporters, MFS transporters are often detected among the cell wall components undergoing changes in response to the shift from normal gravity to microgravity (Sathishkumar et al., 2016). Low-shear simulated microgravity additionally triggered upregulation of some proteins involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes and downregulation of others (Table 1). Glutamate dehydrogenase was threefold and fourfold upregulated in K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, respectively. Together with the glutamine synthase, whose levels were also found to be increased in the mutant, the enzyme is reportedly involved in the primary nitrogen metabolism and in the biosynthesis and metabolism of several amino acids (i.e., arginine biosynthesis, glutamine, alanine and aspartate metabolism) (Meti et al., 2011). Protein D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (CF317_004816-T1/A0A0D2CHE2_9EURO), participating in cysteine, methionine, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, was also more enriched in LSSMG-exposed mutant samples. However, a higher number of enzymes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes was found to be decreased under LSSMG. Nine were downregulated exclusively in the mutant, while protein CF317_006402-T1 was observed also in the wild type. According to the KEGG analysis, some of these proteins are involved with more than one pathway: 4 proteins are implicated in arginine and proline metabolism (CF317_000519-T1, CF317_007970-T1, CF317_007070-T1, CF317_008030-T1), 3 in tyrosine metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006402-T1, CF317_008924-T1), and 2 in histidine metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006712-T1), arginine biosynthesis (CF317_002693-T1, CF317_000519-T1) and phenylalanine biosynthesis and metabolism (CF317_007412-T1, CF317_006402-T1). The putative indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, involved instead in tryptophan catabolic process to the NAD precursor kynurenine, represented the most decreased protein in both strains, with an over 2-fold downregulation. Some proteins falling into the GO category “DNA-templated transcription” were enriched exclusively in the LSSMG-exposed wild type proteome. They were mostly phosphatases—known to also regulate pathways important for stress (Serra-Cardona et al., 2015)—having abundances nearly 2.5-fold higher than in the control samples (i.e., Alkaline phosphatase CF317_008227-T1/A0A0D2BGD8_9EURO and CF317_003892-T1/A0A0D2BGD8_9EURO) (Table 1). Within the same category, downregulation was observed for a putative serine/threonine-protein kinase TOR and two trans domain-containing proteins involved in DNA binding and transcription. Decreased levels of structural protein constituents of the large ribosomal subunit—i.e., ribosomal protein L37e, L34-B and L24e—were instead detected upon LSSMG exposure exclusively in the wild type, alongside the upregulation of the ribonuclease T1 (CF317_005207-T1/W9XBV2_9EURO) involved in RNA degradation. Also significantly decreased was poly(A)polymerase (CF317_003175-T1/A0A1C1CN69_9EURO), an important component in mRNA synthesis, responsible for the addition of the 3′ polyadenine tail to a newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA. In the group of proteins involved in response to stress and chemical, most of the modulated proteins were decreased by LSSMG exposure (Table 1). Downregulated stress response proteins included catalases (i.e., CF317_000687-T1/R8BNJ4_TOGMI, levels 2.7- and 1.9-fold lower than in the unexposed wild type and mutant proteome, respectively; CF317_003242-T1/R4XE87_TAPDE and CF317_008773-T1/U1G9G0_ENDPU), notably involved in the response to oxidative stress, and the 3-phytase CF317_007018-T1/A0A0D2IHR9_9EURO—a phosphatase enzyme with a predicted role in counteracting phosphate deficiency and osmotic stress (Belgaroui et al., 2018)—in both strains. Further, the glutathione-recycling enzyme glutathione reductase (CF317_008426-T1/A0A0D1ZJU8_9EURO) (Couto et al., 2016), the histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (CF317_007412-T1/H6BQ73_EXODN) and the adenylosuccinate synthetase (ASS; F317_004909-T1/W9W243_9EURO), showed lower levels in the mutant under LSSMG conditions. The latter, best known as the first enzyme in the de novo synthesis of AMP from inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP), is responsive to salt stress, as reported in plants (Zhao et al., 2013). Among the proteins with increased abundance in both fungal strains, was glutamate dehydrogenase (CF317_004755-T1), involved in amino acid metabolism and for which a stress-dependent regulation has been demonstrated (e.g., abiotic stress generated ROS) (Skopelitis et al., 2006). Further, the putative cytosolic nitric oxide dioxygenase (CF317_006388-T1/S7Z8A1_PENO1)—reported to play a role in nitric oxide detoxification mechanisms by the conversion of this signaling molecule to nitrate (Cánovas et al., 2016)—was present in the wild type and mutant LSSMG-exposed proteomes at levels around 2-fold higher than that of the unexposed ones. Along with the above-mentioned proteins, a number of enzymes, specifically peptidases involved in proteolysis, were found to be upregulated exclusively in K. chersonesos wild type (Table 1). The putative carboxypeptidase CF317_008840-T1/W9XS38_9EURO and CF317_004157/W2S3B3_9EURO; and CF317_000103/A0A6A6DDQ8_9PEZI and CF317_004551/A0A0D2GVY9_9EURO, known to catalyze reactions that are important to various physiological processes, such as the cell cycle, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response (Neto et al., 2018), were 2-fold and 1.5-fold upregulated, respectively. Lastly, proteins involved in cytoskeleton and organelle organization showed opposite regulation in the two K. chersonesos strains: The first was decreased in the wild type, whereas the latter was upregulated in the mutant (Table 1).Effects of LSSMG on Knufia chersonesos Secretome The proteomic characterization of K. chersonesos secretome upon exposure to LSSMG for 7 days revealed solely 9-up and 2-down regulated proteins in the wild type and 23-up and 48-down regulated proteins in the mutant, when compared to the 1G-exposed counterparts (fold-change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05) (Figure 4B). Among these proteins, the ratio of proteins with predicted extracellular to intracellular localization was approximately 20%:80% in both wild type and mutant (Supplementary Tables 6, 7). Out of 14 proteins with predicted signal peptides in the mutant secretome, 12 were regulated following LSSMG-exposure. In the wild type secretome, 2 out of 61 proteins with predicted extracellular localization were regulated in response to microgravity. The distribution of differentially expressed proteins among BP GO terms is presented in Figure 5B. In the wild type, the regulated proteins were prevalently involved in transport and metabolic processes, whereas in the mutant strain, regulated proteins were mostly involved with biological processes such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (15 proteins), response to chemical and stress (13 proteins), translation, and ribosome biogenesis and transcription (15 proteins). Interestingly, the majority of proteins involved in the above-mentioned GO BP categories exhibited downregulation in LSSMG-exposed secretomes of the mutant and exhibited upregulation in the wild type (Table 2). One protein exhibiting opposite regulation in the two analyzed strains, was the putative scytalone dehydratase CF317_002654-T1, homolog of Phialophora attinorum A0A0N1P280_9EURO. This enzyme, which is reportedly involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin from endogenous substrate (Eisenman and Casadevall, 2012), was 1.5-fold increased in the wild type and 1.6-fold decreased in the melanin-deficient mutant. In the wild type, upregulated proteins also included the adenylosuccinate lyase CF317_004119-T1 and the M20_dimer domain-containing protein (Carboxypeptidase S) CF317_006825-T1, both implicated in amino acid (alanine, aspartate and glutamate) metabolism (KEGG pathway pae00250), and the plasma membrane ATPase CF317_002664-T1, partaking in oxidative phosphorylation (Table 2). Also in the wild type, the casein kinase I 1 CF317_004827-T1 and the histone H2A CF317_001633-T1, both involved in DNA repair (Skoneczna et al., 2018), were found in the LSSMG-exposed secretome at levels 1.7- and 1.6-fold higher than in the unexposed one. The two downregulated proteins were protein CF317_008131-T1, homolog of the arabinan endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinosidase from Aspergillus wentii DTO 134E9, and protein CF317_002949-T1, homolog of the feruloyl esterase A0A177BY00_9PLEO from Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, both with a predicted extracellular localization and reportedly involved in polysaccharide degradation (Tesei et al., 2020).

proteome (p ≤ 0.05). aProtein accession number in the K. chersonesos database of ab initio translated proteins.In the K. chersonesos mutant, LSSMG triggered the upregulation of just a low number of proteins. The malate dehydrogenase CF317_003266-T1/A0A1C1CNC5_9EURO, 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1/A0A438MTW5_EXOME and alpha, alpha-trehalase CF317_004588-T1/H6C927_EXODN, involved in the metabolism of starch, sucrose, and sphingolipids, were 2. 4-, 1.9-, and 1.8-fold upregulated, respectively. Conversely, proteins with decreased abundance encompassed, among others, enzymes catalyzing different steps throughout the process of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (KEGG pathway hsa00010)—such as the putative phosphotransferase CF317_008448/W2RU25_9EURO, the phosphoglycerate kinase CF317_004751/W2RJE3_9EURO and the 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase CF317_003513/H6BNI5_EXODN—fructose and mannose (hsa00051), pyruvate (hsa00620) and glycerolipid metabolism (hsa00561), and the pentose phosphate pathway (hsa00030) (i.e., phosphotransferase, epimerase domain-containing protein CF317_008979 and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating CF317_005481). Further, the CF317_007096/A0A0U1M0E3_TALIS 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, acting as an activator of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (Raben and Wolfgang, 2019), was the most decreased protein in the GO category of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with a 3-fold downregulation. Increased levels of proteins with a role in the response to stress and chemicals (Table 2) were observed in the exposed secretomes for the plasma membrane protein CF317_000051-T1/A0A178DA36_9EURO with reported phosphatase activity and the guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta CF317_007665-T1/A0A0D2CV56_9EURO with a role in signal transduction, among others. However, as already observed for the whole-cell proteome, the majority of proteins involved in stress response showed decreased abundance upon exposure to LSSMG. The DNA-repair protein histone H2A (CF317_001633-T1), upregulated in the wild type secretome, was at least twofold downregulated in the mutant, together with the nucleoside diphosphate kinase CF317_007147-T1/A0A178C9G0_9EURO. The latter, ubiquitous enzyme involved in nucleotides biosynthetic process (Janin and Deville-Bonne, 2002), has been shown to participate in the metabolism of selective drugs like Isoniazid and Fluorouracil (KEGG map00983) in Homo sapiens. The same was observed for the S-formylglutathione hydrolase, whose activity is mainly linked to methane metabolism and the recycling of glutathione in cell detoxification pathways (Haslam et al., 2002; Yurimoto et al., 2003). Similarly, the thioredoxin domain-containing protein CF317_000980-T1 and the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating CF317_005481-T1/A0A0N0NLG1_9EURO, both involved in cell redox homeostasis and glutathione metabolism (Li et al., 2019), showed an around twofold downregulation. Also in the categories of transcription, translation, and ribosome biogenesis, downregulated proteins outnumbered the upregulated ones (Table 2). The most increased protein (almost twofold) was the putative D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) domain-containing protein CF317_008030-T1/A0A0D1YYX4_9EURO, also involved in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis (KEGG 00311). Elongation factor EF-1 beta and gamma subunit (CF317_008933-T1 and CF317_000379-T1), homologs of Exophiala dermatitidis CBS 525.76 H6BVG8_EXODN and H6BY84_EXODN proteins and involved in purine metabolism (KEGG 00230), were detected in the mutant LSSMG-exposed secretome at levels at least 3.5-fold lower than that of the unexposed ones. Further, four ribosomal proteins—i.e., 40S ribosomal protein S20 and S24 (CF317_001861-T1 and CF317_004501-T1); 60S ribosomal protein P1 and L7 (CF317_007960-T1 and CF317_005516-T1)—showed decreased abundance. Additionally downregulated in response to LSSMG were the uncharacterized HIT domain-containing protein CF317_006677-T1 (over 3-fold regulated) and the putative versicolorin reductase CF317_003229-T1 (over 2-fold regulated), the latter known to mediate aflatoxins biosynthetic processes (Nakamura et al., 2011). Modulation was also observed in proteins involved in transport such as the above-mentioned 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1 with a role on starch and sucrose metabolism, the endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein CF317_004472-T1, and the inorganic phosphate transport protein PHO88 CF317_006347-T1, which all appeared to be upregulated. Conversely, the transmembrane transporter “putative inorganic phosphate transporter C8E4.01c” CF317_002531-T1, the uncharacterized NTF2 domain-containing protein CF317_007808-T1, and the glycolytic enzyme phosphotransferase CF317_008448-T1 were detected as downregulated. Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut Exhibit Opposite Regulation of Several Differentially Expressed Proteins The comparative analysis of all examined samples to a reference sample—a pool of all established experimental conditions—revealed qualitative and quantitative differences between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut at the proteome and secretome level. This was especially evident when examining the top 10 differentially regulated proteins i.e., the 10 most up- and downregulated proteins at each experimental condition. A number of these proteins were found to undergo opposite modulation in the two strains, mainly in the whole-cell proteome. Distribution of the top differentially regulated whole-cell proteins is summarized in Supplementary Table 8: out of 41 different proteins, 6 were found to be top regulated in wild type and mutant under both normal gravity and microgravity condition, 10 only in the Wt and 10 exclusively in the Mut. Around 25% represented ribosomal proteins; 10% were proteins whose identity or function could not be elucidated after homology search; and the remaining proteins were involved in RNA binding, transcription, translation, transport, and carbohydrate metabolism. Out of the 49 top differentially regulated proteins from the secreted fraction, 2 were found in both strains at all experimental conditions, 17 only in the Wt and 17 only in the Mut (Supplementary Table 9). Similar to what was observed for the proteome, 26% of the detected proteins were ribosomal, followed by enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (18%)—secreted esterases and lipases included—and in transport (10%). Altogether, the eight top differentially regulated proteins common to wild type and mutant in both normal gravity and microgravity—i.e., the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal proteins L28 (CF317_000935-T1), L32 (CF317_002712-T1), L35 (CF317_001879-T1) and L36 (CF317_007709-T1), the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal protein S30 (CF317_005321-T1), the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (CF317_001622-T1), the murein transglycosylase (CF317_006383-T1) and the uncharacterized protein CF317_007965-T1—displayed an LSSMG-dependent regulation that also appeared to be specific to the Wt strain (Supplementary Figure 3). As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, all proteins that are upregulated in the Wt strain appear to be downregulated in the Mut strain and vice versa. A protein-protein interaction analysis was performed to verify the occurrence of these 8 proteins in common pathways, using STRING. A 6-node network was obtained for the proteins which matched homologs (sequence homology) in the STRING database (Supplementary Figure 4) and an interaction was confirmed for ribosomal proteins S30 (homolog of E. dermatitidis XP_009156842.1) and L35 (homolog of XP_009155966.1). As a component of the SSU, S30 has a role in mRNAs binding and selection of cognate aminoacyl-transferase RNA (tRNA), whereas L35 is required for polymerization of the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain (Ben-Shem et al., 2011). The involvement of protein L35 in cell growth regulation and apoptosis has additionally been reported (Bommer and Stahl, 2005). The proteins’ functional link (combined score: 0.999) was supported by evidence such as the co-expression of orthologs (score 0.963) and their interaction in other organisms (experimental/biochemical data, score: 0.904). Further interactions could not be detected possibly because functional characterization of these proteins in E. dermatitidis is yet to be thoroughly achieved. Knufia chersonesos Wt and Mut Comparative Analysis Under Normal Gravity (1G) A comparative analysis of wild type and mutant was performed to evaluate different responses at the proteome and secretome level under control condition, i.e., normal gravity. The analysis of the whole-cell proteome yielded a total of 100 proteins with increased and 40 proteins with decreased abundance in K. chersonesos Mut, compared with the wild type (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05). As shown in Supplementary Figure 5A, “protein translation,” “organelle organization,” and “regulation of biological processes” were detected as the prevalent processes in the mutant, encompassing more than 50% of all upregulated proteins. This includes several ribosomal proteins and ribonucleoproteins. Ribosomal proteins L32 (CF317_002712), L36 (CF317_007709), S30 (CF317_005321) and L37 (CF317_004524-T1) and the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (CF317_001622-T1) were among the most upregulated proteins, being present in the mutant at level 8.7 to 3.6 (3.1 to 1.85 log2 fold change) higher than in the wild type (Supplementary Table 10). Increased levels were also observed for proteins involved in RNA metabolic processes and in transcription such as the U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 11 (A0A0D2DFT3_9EURO), the U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm4 (CF317_002219-T1) and the pre-mRNA-splicing factor isy1 (CF317_006097-T1),—partaking in nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA and in pre-mRNA splicing (Zhou et al., 2014)—the transcription factors C2H2 and RfeG (CF317_009591-T1 and CF317_000265-T1) and the 2′-phosphotransferase (CF317_002731-T1). Protein modulation also affected enzymes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation, whose levels resulted to be increased in K. chersonesos Mut, i.e., the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6 (CF317_000645-T1 and CF317_000273-T1), cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 7 (CF317_008279-T1), NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1 alpha subcomplex subunit CF317_000197-T1. Regulation of proteins involved in chemical and stress response was also observed. The histone H2A (CF317_001633-T1)—reported to have a role on DNA repair (Moore et al., 2007)—and the Nuclear transcription factor Y alpha (CF317_006017-T1)—with multiple roles in development and stress response (Zhao et al., 2017)—were found at levels at least 1.6-fold higher than in the melanized counterpart. Conversely, downregulated processes at normal gravity condition prevalently encompassed carbohydrate, lipid and general cellular metabolism (Supplementary Figure 5A). Decreased levels were observed for glycoside hydrolases and esterolytic enzymes including the alpha-galactosidase (CF317_004369-T1) and cutinases (CF317_007621-T1)—levels 9.7- and 7-fold lower than in the wild type—for the glucan 1,3-beta glucosidase (CF317_002004-T1; 1.69-folds decreased) and for the murein transglycosylase (CF317_004960-T1, CF317_003460-T1, CF317_006383-T1; 1.83-, 2- and 4-fold decreased), enzymes responsible for polymers and microbial degradation by cleavage at the peptidoglycan or the cell wall polysaccharides level (Lincoln et al., 1997). Additionally, proteins involved in lipid metabolic process—i.e., acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (CF317_005988-T1), isocitrate lyase (CF317_004212-T1) and lipase (CF317_005885-T1)—and in protein catabolism—i.e., proteasome subunit alpha type (CF317_008861-T1), proteasome endopeptidase complex (CF317_004788-T1) and peptidase S53 domain-containing protein (CF317_005049-T1)—showed decreased levels between 1.8- and 1.5-fold. At the secretome level, the quantitative analysis of K. chersonesos Mut v/s Wt under normal gravity conditions, resulted in the detection of 104 proteins with increased and 87 proteins with decreased abundance in the mutant secretome. Of these proteins, 24% have predicted extracellular localization based on the presence of a signal peptide (Supplementary Table 11). Distribution of over-represented biological process GO terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Supplementary Figure 5B. Most of proteins upregulated in the mutant were involved with carbohydrate metabolism and regulation of biological process (24% of all upregulated proteins), transport (9%), response to stress (8%) and transcription (8%). A number of hydrolases required for the breakdown of β-glucan chains and other cell-wall components— i.e., carboxylic ester hydrolyses (CF317_004653-T1, CF317_008040-T1, CF317_002308-T1, CF317_005799-T1), feruloyl esterase (CF317_002949-T1), alongside glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (CF317_002004-T1), murein transglycosylase (CF317_006383-T1) and cutinase (CF317_007621-T1) which were downregulated in the mutant proteome—were present in the secretome at levels comprised between 1.5- and 4-folds higher than in the wild type (Supplementary Table 11). The same for mannan endo-1,6-alpha-mannosidase (CF317_001276-T1) and chitin deacetylase (CF317_003258-T1), which play multiple roles in the function of the fungal cell wall (Spreghini et al., 2003; Mouyna et al., 2020). In the category transport, the multicopper oxidase (CF317_009669-T1; 1.9-fold), the chloride channel protein (CF317_004136-T; 1.7-folds) and the nitrate/nitrite transporter (CF317_004846-T1; 1.6-fold) represented the most upregulated proteins. Increased levels of stress-response proteins were observed for the Histone H2A protein (CF317_001633-T1; 1.7-fold)—found to be overexpressed also in the mutant proteome—alongside the redox protein thioredoxin (CF317_006109-T1; 1.7-fold), catalase A (CF317_009216-T1; 1.7-fold) and the housekeeping enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase (CF317_007147-T1; 2.3-fold), whose involvement in the signaling pathway of oxidative stresses has been reported (Desorption et al., 2000). Normal gravity condition was also characterized by increased levels of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (CF317_005659-T1), EF-1 gamma subunit (CF317_000379-T1), and alkaline phosphatase (CF317_008227-T1; CF317_003892-T1), all involved in transcription. Conversely, decreased levels were observed in the secretome almost exclusively for proteins involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis (Supplementary Figure 5B). Out of 87 downregulated proteins, more than 50 encompassed ribosomal proteins. Of these, the most downregulated ones— the 60S ribosomal proteins L32 (CF317_006070-T1), L35 (CF317_001879-T1) and L33-A (CF317_005595-T1)—were present at levels below 5-fold than their counterparts in the wild type secretome. Other proteins were prevalently involved in stress/chemical response, e.g., plasma membrane phosphatase (CF317_000051-T1), CipC-like antibiotic response protein (CF317_003991-T1), small heat shock protein (SHSP) domain-containing protein (CF317_001628-T1). These findings pose interesting questions regarding the presence of intracellular proteins in K. chersonesos secretome: while it may be indicative of cell lysis during cultivation, it may also suggest that ribosomal and other non-classical secretory proteins are found in the culture supernatant due to EVs-mediated secretion (Sun and Su, 2019). The co-isolation of these and classical secretory proteins during sample preparation can occur if no prior separation of the vesicle containing fraction from the secretome, is performed (Vallejo et al., 2012).Discussion To date, investigations into the responses of microorganisms to space and Mars-like conditions have been performed with few black fungi species; some of them involved stress simulation in ground-based facilities (Pacelli et al., 2017), while others carried out the exposure of fungal strains inside or outside the International Space Station (Onofri et al., 2012, 2019; Pacelli et al., 2016). With only one exception (Zakharova et al., 2014)—the comparative study of 2D protein patterns under Mars-like conditions—the majority of astrobiological work carried out with black fungi has mainly focused on the analysis of ultrastructural alterations and DNA integrity. Hence, this study represents the first qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to simulated space conditions, i.e., microgravity, which has significance to exobiology and implications to planetary protection policy. In-depth understanding of proteome-related alterations in cell physiology is crucial to gaining new insight into the evolution of extremophiles and the actual limits for life. Further, the comparative analysis of a melanin-deficient mutant and the wild type is important to evaluate the role of melanization in stress survival. Under microgravity conditions, a development toward a more clump-like growth was observed in both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut and may be due to the low shear and low turbulence suspension culture environment created by LSSMG. However, morphological differences were not detected via FE-SEM in cells grown under LSSMG compared to those grown in 1G. This is not surprising, as black fungi reportedly resort to strategies to minimize efforts at both the morphological and physiological level when exposed to stress conditions (Sterflinger, 2006). Microcolonial growth and the switch among different growth forms—i.e., budding and hyphae formation—ensure that these organisms have a lifestyle versatility to cope with a variety of stress in their natural habitats (Sterflinger et al., 1999; Gostinčar et al., 2011). Unaltered morphology upon exposure to LSSMG was previously described in filamentous fungi in both suspension (e.g., Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum) (Sathishkumar et al., 2014) and agar cultures (A. niger, Candida albicans) (Yamazaki et al., 2012), albeit LSSMG-induced phenotypic changes have been to date substantiated by a higher number of studies on fungal species e.g., Pleurotus sp., Candida sp., Cladosporium sp., Ulocladium sp., Basipetospora sp., etc (Miyazaki et al., 2010; Searles et al., 2011; Gomoiu et al., 2013). Interestingly, the sole morphological response to microgravity detected in the present study was the early switch to hyphae formation observed in K. chersonesos Wt (at day 5 instead of day 7, as in normal gravity; Figure 2). This is consistent with previous reports of increased filamentous growth under LSSMG in the opportunistic fungal pathogen C. albicans (Altenburg et al., 2008). The observation of early hyphal development in non-pathogenic species in response to LSSMG is rather suggestive of biofilm formation as a strategy for enhanced resistance to stress and for the forage for nutrients (Searles et al., 2011). Both LSSMG-cultured K. chersonesos Mut and their 1G controls showed extensive cell self-aggregation, i.e., cell clumping and occasional filamentation that are characteristics of black fungi (Nai et al., 2013). Significant variations were also not found in the total cell number, and cell size was not affected by microgravity in both strains (Supplementary Tables 1, 2), unlike what has been documented by studies on a variety of bacteria (Huang et al., 2018) and yeasts (Crabbé et al., 2013). The results of proteomics analysis revealed that exposure to LSSMG altered the proteome and secretome of both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut when compared to the 1G counterparts, having an impact on different pathways. Interestingly, the mutant response mainly involved protein downregulation, which might suggest a general slowing of the metabolic rate (Figure 4B). In contrast, more subtle rearrangements in the protein repertoire were observed in the wild type, especially in the secreted fraction, which possibly reflect a fine-tuning of the regulation of protein expression. Regardless, both strains showed increased abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially at the whole-cell proteome level (Figure 5A). Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism were found to be promoted in the wild type, whereas the glyoxylate shunt, ancillary cycle to TCA cycle and essential for growth on two-carbon compounds (Lorenz and Fink, 2001), was upregulated in the mutant. Similar alterations in carbohydrate metabolism were previously observed in melanotic filamentous fungi exposed to simulated Mars conditions (SMC) or to ISS-conditions (Romsdahl et al., 2018, 2019; Blachowicz et al., 2019a). Here, increased abundance was also observed for several starvation-induced glycoside hydrolases with roles in nutrient acquisition from biopolymers and in the recycling of cell wall components to support cell maintenance. Starvation response was thereby suggested as crucial adaptation to space conditions, especially oligotrophy. Conversely, one characteristic of both K. chersonesos Wt and Mut was decreased levels of glycoside hydrolases and cell wall–degradation enzymes such as the endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase (CF317_0009683-T1) and the extracellular cell wall glucanase Crf1 (CF317_009779-T1). The same was observed for carbohydrate-active enzymes like cutinases and for lipases at both the proteome and the secretome level, which suggests that, under space conditions, black fungi opt for strategies different than those adopted by filamentous fungi. GO analysis and pathways prediction further revealed upregulation of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) and in the metabolism of phospho- and glycerophospholipids. This may be explained by modifications in membrane lipid composition aimed at maintaining membranes stability against stress (Xia et al., 2019). More specifically, an LSSMG-dependent increase in membrane fluidity attributable to a higher USFA/SFA ratio was previously demonstrated by studies in plain lipid membranes, various microorganisms e.g., Escherichia coli and plants upon exposure to microgravity (Sieber et al., 2014; Kim and Rhee, 2016; Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Potentially, this could affect the function of membrane-integrated proteins, thereby leading to altered transporter activity. Whether the activity of uptake transporters is altered in microgravity conditions is currently unknown (Eyal and Derendorf, 2019). However, similarly to what was observed in other fungi e.g., C. albicans (Crabbé et al., 2013) and bacteria e.g., Bacillus subtilis (Morrison et al., 2019) in space, K. chersonesos Wt and Mut ion-channels and integral membrane proteins were found to be upregulated. The increased abundance of specific transporters generally maximizes the uptake of nutrients (e.g., phosphate and nitrogen). As such, it possibly represents an adaptive response to temporary starvation caused either by zones of nutrient depletion developing around the colony or by the partial loss of contact of the cells with the culture medium, which may occur under microgravity conditions (Mazars et al., 2014; Senatore et al., 2018). Other types of transporters—i.e., ammonium transporters and permeases for transmembrane amino acid transport—could provide a link between nitrogen assimilation and proteins synthesis (Martzivanou et al., 2006). Indeed, upregulation of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolic processes was recorded under LSSMG conditions, but a higher number of these proteins was found to be decreased, especially in the mutant proteome. Decreases in the levels of structural ribosomal proteins involved in cytoplasmic translation (i.e., L23a, L37a, and L34) and of the poly(A)polymerase, as well as the increase in RNA degrading ribonuclease T1, were additionally detected in microgravity. Together, the regulation of these proteins may suggest that protein translation via ribosomal translational machinery is reduced upon exposure to LSSMG, a phenomenon that has been indicated as a widespread response to microgravity, space, and Mars-like conditions not only in fungi (Sheehan et al., 2007; Willaert, 2013; Feger et al., 2016; Kamal et al., 2018, 2019; Blachowicz et al., 2019a). Remarkably, in our study, a decrease in translation and ribosome biogenesis was only observed in the wild type whole-cell proteome and, to a minor extent, in the mutant secretome (Figure 5B). However, ribosomes are very dynamic organelles and additional tests will be needed to confirm that the 2-fold regulation of the above-mentioned proteins is actually indicative of reduced protein synthesis under microgravity. In a similar fashion, proteins taking part in functional organization of cell organelles and cytoskeleton—for which a wide spectrum of microgravity-dependent changes has been reported (Zhang et al., 2015)—showed opposite regulation in the wild type and the mutant. The same was observed in the secretome for the DNA-repair Histone H2A and the scytalone dehydratase, the latter involved in the biosynthesis of DNH melanin from endogenous substrate (Eisenman and Casadevall, 2012), which were upregulated in the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. This is suggestive of increased measures for cell protection and is in line with the fact that melanin pigmentation and enhanced melanin synthesis is most often a feature of fungi living on space stations (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008; De Middeleer et al., 2019). Further, versicolorin reductase (CF317_003229-T1), a protein mediating aflatoxins biosynthetic processes, was also decreased only in the mutant. Although production of aflatoxins in K. chersonesos has hitherto not been reported, this finding can be indicative of reduced production of allergenic or toxic metabolites (e.g., polyketides). Also in the mutant, the upregulation of hydrolytic enzymes such as the alpha, alpha-trehalase suggests a recourse to store carbohydrates as a carbon source. By contrast, production of compounds that increase the osmotolerancy (e.g., trehalose) represents a quite common protective measure implemented by microorganisms under microgravity and other types of stress (Willaert, 2013). Opposite protein regulation was especially evident when examining the top 10 proteins differentially regulated in both strains at all experimental conditions, which included several ribosomal proteins (Supplementary Figure 3). These discrepancies suggest that strategies to cope with suboptimal conditions of growth may be strain-specific and that diverse rearrangements of proteome repertoire are possibly related to the presence or absence of melanin in the cell wall. Indeed, differences between wild type and mutant proteomic profiles were even observed at normal gravity condition. Proteins involved in translation, transcription and RNA metabolic process were significantly more upregulated in the mutant proteome than in the wild type (up to 9-fold, as in the case of ribosomal proteins L32, L36, S30 and L37), whereas the mutant secretome showed increased abundance of a number of hydrolases required for the breakdown of biopolymers and cell wall components (Supplementary Figure 5). A number of proteins differentially expressed under simulated microgravity were involved in stress response, including glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; CF317_004755-T1) and nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD; CF317_006388-T1), over-represented in the proteome of both fungi, and chemical stress component proteins with proteolytic and phosphatase activity. While its role as a stress-responsive enzyme was speculated for GDH (i.e., ROS) (Skopelitis et al., 2006), NOD participates in mechanisms of detoxification of nitric oxide, a gas with multiple roles in cellular metabolism ranging from defense to signaling. The observation of peptidases, which were enriched in K. chersonesos Wt proteome under exposure to LSSMG, may instead suggest the removal of damaged proteins to enhance cellular fitness and maximize survival (Bonham-Carter et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). In this respect, it should be noted that a role of altered gravity in the breakdown of protein structures has been previously reported (Trotter et al., 2015). However, a major part of detected stress response proteins involved in cell redox homeostasis, glutathione metabolism and recycling and osmotic stress defense—i.e., catalases, glutathione reductases, 3-phytases and s-formylglutathione hydrolases—appeared to be decreased under exposure to LSSMG. As previously suggested in plants (Zhang et al., 2015), downregulation of general stress response proteins under microgravity might indicate an impaired activation of the defense response components. However, decreased levels of common stress proteins and lack of a heat shock response (HSP) represent a key component of black fungi response to a variety of suboptimal conditions of growth and have been attributed to an energy-saving strategy that relies on a fine-tuning regulation of protein abundance (Tesei et al., 2012, 2015; Zakharova et al., 2013, 2014; Blasi et al., 2017). One further interesting aspect was the high number of proteins traditionally recognized as cytoplasmic in K. chersonesos secretome, especially in the mutant (i.e., 6% of total secreted proteins with predicted signal peptide v/s 25% in the wild type; 20% of regulated secreted proteins had signal peptides in both strains). Such a discrepancy between wild type and mutant was also reported in a study of K. chersonesos secretome aimed at the screening for novel polyesterases (Tesei et al., 2020), hence it seems to suggest that a low number of extracellular proteins may be a peculiarity of the mutant secretome. The presence of cytoplasmic proteins in the culture supernatant may indicate that the mutant is more prone to cell lysis than the wild type (Miura and Ueda, 2018). However, given that proteins with no signal peptide (leaderless) can also be found in the secreted fraction as a result of non-classical protein secretion, e.g., via EVs-mediated pathways (Vallejo et al., 2012; Sun and Su, 2019), it may as well indicate co-isolation of vesicle proteins and classical secretory proteins during sample preparation procedures. These proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, signaling, cell division and transport, etc.), for which vesicular transport might be the only route of extracellular delivery, are generally predicted as non-secretory (Bleackley et al., 2019). Together, the aspects of protein modulation observed in K. chersonesos Wt and Mut suggest that the basic energy metabolism was upregulated in the Wt strain. Here, rearrangements of the protein repertoire resembled the classic response to microgravity, but with no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response. The mutant mostly engaged in protein downregulation, without affecting their cell growth and survivability. This study therefore indicates the ability of black fungi to cope with microgravity conditions and suggests that cell wall melanization may ultimately influence the metabolic response to microgravity. Point mutation will be needed to confirm whether mutagenesis played a role in protein downregulation in K. chersonesos Mut. To further our understanding about the impact of microgravity on ribosome biogenesis and protein translation, future work shall involve proteomics workflows such as radio-labeled protein expression assays.Data Availability Statement WGS data for K. chersonesos MA5789 are available in  GenBank (GCA_002319055.1), under BioSample accession number SAMN07326825 and BioProject accession number PRJNA393270.

Continued characterization of this closed habitat's microbiome enables tracking of the spread and evolution of secondary pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health.ANNOUNCEMENT The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the only long-term human habitat in space. Microgravity disrupts human immune function (1), and close monitoring of the ISS microbiome for increased pathogenicity is thus an ongoing critical task. Here, we report the draft genomes of 96 bacterial strains that were isolated from the ISS (Table 1). Eleven of the 14 species found are common members of the human microbiome, and most can act as opportunistic human pathogens. TABLE 1.

blood agar. Four species from the phylum Actinobacteria were isolated, from the genera Pseudoclavibacter, Kocuria, and Micrococcus, all of which are common in both environmental and human microbiomes (2–5). Kocuria palustris and Micrococcus luteus are opportunistic pathogens (5, 6). M. luteus can survive in a dormant state under extreme oligotrophic conditions (7) and has increased growth and increased biomass yield in microgravity (8). Multiple coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were also isolated. CoNS are normal components of human skin flora (9) and are often resistant to antibiotics because of their ability to form biofilms (10); all CoNS in this report are documented opportunistic pathogens (11–15). Three species from the phylum Proteobacteria were identified. Acinetobacter pittii is a less common nosocomial pathogen that causes pneumonia and meningitis in intensive care patients (16), Pseudomonas fulva is a commensal plant endophyte (17) that can also infect immunocompromised patients (18, 19), and Pseudomonas granadensis is a recently discovered soil bacterium (20). Two other species in this report that are not associated with the human microbiome are Cytobacillus horneckiae, a Gram-positive UV-resistant endospore-former that was isolated from a clean room at the Kennedy Space Center (21), and Methylobacterium organophilum, a facultative methylotroph (22). All strains reported here were collected aboard the ISS over the course of five flight missions between June 2017 and December 2018 (Table 1). Premoistened polyester wipes were used to collect samples from eight predetermined surfaces during each flight (see Table 1 for locations). After transport to Earth, the wipes were agitated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and the buffer was concentrated with an InnovaPrep CP-150 concentrator. Concentrates were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) agar (25°C for 7 days), potato dextrose agar (PDA) (25°C for 7 days), and blood agar (37°C for 2 days) using appropriate concentrations for microbial isolation. Isolated colonies were restreaked on tryptic soy agar (TSA) (25°C), and genomic DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries for whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) were prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit as in previous studies (23) and were sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. Sequencing reads were quality filtered and trimmed, and adapter sequences were removed, using FastQC v0.11.7 (24) and fastp v0.20.0 (25). Scaffolds were assembled with SPAdes v3.11.1 (26). QUAST v5.0.2 (27) was used to determine assembly quality, including the number of contigs, genome size, and N50 value. Default settings were used for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. OrthoANIu (28) was used to confirm the species identity for each strain against the species type strain sequence, with a minimum average nucleotide identity of 95% for identification. Genomes were annotated using the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (29). Data availability.

    "abstract": "Abstract Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production. Subject terms: Microbiology, Plant sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction As humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned missions to the Moon and cis-lunar orbit, it has become evident that growing plants for food and other life support systems is essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4. To ensure that these future missions are successful, it is necessary to investigate all aspects of the basic physiological and molecular responses of food crops and their microbiomes to the spaceflight environment, so that any issues faced on these missions can be efficiently managed and mitigated on-orbit. Plants have complex and dynamic relationships with their microorganisms, which are influenced by various stresses and environmental factors, including spaceflight5–9. The novel environments of spaceflight and microgravity analogs have been shown to alter the plant–microbe interactions at both the genetic and physiological levels, oftentimes resulting in increased susceptibility to diseases10–14. For example, soybean seedlings grown in spaceflight are more susceptible to the colonization of fungal pathogen, Phytophthora sojae, when compared to ground controls10. In addition, simulated microgravity experiments have demonstrated that clinorotation reduces the growth and development of the legume Medicargo truncatula and significantly affects its symbiotic relationship with the rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus irregularis15. Specifically, nodule size and number were reduced under clinorotation when compared to static controls15. Moreover, in another simulated microgravity experiment performed on random positioning machines, the endophytic bacterial diversity in wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings behaves differently under simulated microgravity when compared to normal gravity controls14. Specifically, some bacterial genera (e.g., Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, and Bacillus) that can produce plant growth-promoting and antimicrobial substances, exhibit clear differences in relative abundance between microgravity and Earth gravity treatments14. However, research on how microgravity impacts plant–microbe interactions is still in its infancy. It is, therefore, critical to develop efficient methods for investigating plant–microbe interactions to expand our current knowledge base for future space exploration. The dynamic nature of plant–microbial interactions requires regular monitoring of a crop’s microbiome and its metabolic activities to assess plant health. These measures together with other surveillance techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) will ensure that successful cultivation of crops on long-duration missions in space can be accomplished. To date, plants have been successfully grown in space in multiple hardware systems, such as the Vegetable Production System (Veggie), Advanced Plant Habitat, and the LADA greenhouse16. For example, edible leafy crops have been safely produced in the Veggie hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumed by crew members17. There have been, however, sporadic instances of contamination with opportunistic fungal pathogens. In a Veggie experiment (VEG-01C), Zinnia hybrida plants were infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum18,19. F. oxysporum is a ubiquitous group of soilborne fungi that are highly adaptable to different habitats and include non-pathogenic strains, plant pathogens, and even opportunistic human pathogens20. Pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum can cause Fusarium wilt in nearly every agriculturally important crop21. Some multi-host isolates in plants also have the potential to cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised mammals22–25. Even though the fungal infection on the Zinnia plants was likely due to a malfunction of a fan in the Veggie hardware26, it demonstrated the importance of characterizing the healthy basal microbiome of all plants cultivated in space. To achieve this goal, methodologies are needed to regularly monitor changes in the microbial community during flight to potentially mitigate the rise of pathogenic taxa. Currently, the standard protocol for the investigation of plant–pathogen interactions aboard the ISS is to harvest the plant material, freeze it, and return it to Earth for analysis27. However, with future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit likely taking up to 6 months between resupply missions, it will be critical to develop faster, on-side methodologies to regularly monitor and assess plant–microbe health. Here we present a method for using metatranscriptomics coupled with nanopore sequencing to characterize the plant microbiome and their functional activity from plant–microbe total RNA samples that could be feasibly completed on-orbit. Metatranscriptomics has emerged as an effective methodology to characterize the plant microbiome and evaluate its transcriptional activity28. Transcriptional surveys, among many others, enable the identification and assessment of the main drivers of changes in plant health29–32. However, to date, metatranscriptomic studies of plant microbiomes have all utilized Illumina sequencing platforms, which are not feasible for spaceflight applications due to their large up-mass, weight, and footprint. The pocket-sized, USB-powered nanopore MinION, sequencing platform, which weighs <100 g and is capable of single-molecule sequencing of native full-length DNA and RNA molecules33, has emerged as a viable sequence platform for spaceflight. In 2016, the nanopore-sequencing system was successfully used aboard the ISS for DNA analysis and compared to next-generation sequencing platforms, such as Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII34. Although the nanopore system has been successfully used for DNA applications, its use for metatranscriptomic analyses is only now emerging35–38 and has not yet been used to analyze the metatranscriptome of microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA samples. As a proof-of-concept, we have characterized the microbiome of red romaine lettuce grown under a baseline condition (i.e., ISS-like ground controls) using MinION-based metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that plants can be rapidly and effectively screened using this molecular approach. By developing reliable methodologies to regularly monitor and compare changes in the functional activity of the plant microorganisms over time, early detection of opportunistic pathogens can help inform mitigation strategies and provide important insight into agricultural practices aboard spacecraft to maximize crop production and ensure crew safety on long-duration missions.",
    "methods": "Methods Sample collection and RNA extraction Seeds of red romaine lettuce, L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” were surface-sanitized with a bleach-hydrochloric acid solution (30 ml 6% Pure Bright Germicidal Ultra Bleach and 500 μl 37% hydrochloric acid) for 1 h and allowed to off-gas for 24 h prior to planting. Sanitization was verified by placing seeds on trypticase soy agar and inhibitory mold agar plates, and incubating for 48–72 h at 30 °C18. A standard validation protocol was used to conform the effectiveness of the sanitization protocol26. No bacterial or fungal growth was observed on the plates during the screening process. Three surface-sanitized seeds were individually placed in 4 inch pots containing greens-grade arcillite, a calcined clay and time-release fertilizer typically used in spaceflight hardware26, and were grown in environmentally controlled growth chambers at the KSC that mimicked conditions of the ISS. The growth chambers were cleaned to remove any potential human-associated microbes before use, but were not sterilized. To simulate conditions aboard the ISS, the plants were maintained at 50% relative humidity, 3000 p.p.m. CO2, and 23 °C. The growth cycle was established on a 16 h (light)/8 h (dark) cycle under fluorescent cool white lights (200–300 μE m−2 s−1) and all were on daily automatic watering with deionized water. Pots were thinned to one plant each at day 7 and samples were harvested at day 28 for leafy greens. Lettuce leaf tissue from each of the three pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) was placed immediately into RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and stored at −80 °C until ready for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from each of the three lettuce leave replicates with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The recovered RNA was DNase-treated with the optional on-column digestion following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified using Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A sample of clean RNAlater was used as a negative control throughout the sample preparation process. No RNA was obtained or amplified from the negative control sample. Enrichment of microbial transcripts An enrichment method was developed to enable the separation of plant and microbial RNAs for subsequent sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore-sequencing technology41. Using the recovered host–microbial total RNA (7.33–23.56 µg), the Dynabeads poly(A) capture protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed to remove poly(A)-containing RNAs (e.g., plant mRNAs). Of note, plants and fungi both have poly(A)-containing mRNA. It is therefore likely that some of the fungal RNA were also removed during the enrichment process. The remaining poly(A)-depleted material (microbial mRNA/rRNA and plant rRNA) was then purified with the Zymo RNA clean and concentration kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The remaining RNAs were processed using the RiboMinus Plant Kit for the removal of plant rRNA as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The host-depleted RNA (1–10 μg) from each sample was then A-tailed using Poly(A) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 25 min at 37 °C. The enriched microbial RNA (mRNA and rRNA) quantity was assessed with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and quality was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). To assess the purity of RNA, A260/280 readings were also taken with the UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The samples were stored at −80 °C until library preparation. Nanopore cDNA-PCR library preparation Library preparation for cDNA-PCR sequencing was performed using the SQK-PCS109 sequencing kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Briefly, 50 ng of enriched microbial RNA samples from L93, L96, and L101 were reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and incubated in a thermal cycler at 42 °C for 90 min and then 85 °C for 5 min. To amplify the products without introducing biases, full-length transcripts were selected using the Nanopore rapid attachment primers (SQK-PCS109) using LongAmp Taq 2× Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with the following cycling conditions, an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 62 °C, and 1 min at 65 °C, and a final extension step at 65 °C for 6 min and a hold at 4 °C. The products were then purified and separated using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) with 1.8 (v/v) ratio of magnetic beads to the reaction mixture. The cDNA library using 100 fmol of amplified cDNA with adapters was loaded onto a FLO-MIN106D R9 flowcell and sequencing was performed with a MinION device for 48 h. cDNA derived from each replicate (L93, L96, L101) were sequenced on individual flowcells to provide information about the process reproducibility and variability. Bioinformatics and data analysis RNA-sequencing data were base-called in real-time using an integrated version of Guppy in the MinKNOW software v3.3.2 via the MinIT device v19.05.2. All FASTQ files were concatenated and used in the bioinformatics pipeline illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. Briefly, MinION-sequencing statistics were analyzed using Nanoplot v1.0.067 and adapters were trimmed using Porechop v0.2.468. Reads were filtered for a minimum read length of 100 bp and minimum Q-score of 5 using filtlong v0.2.0 was to ensure that >80% of the reads in all three samples were as previously described69. Large chimeric reads of >30,000 bp were also filtered out using a Unix shell command. The N50 read length, which is defined as the read length such that reads of this length or greater composes at least 50% of the total bases, was 417, 616, and 512 bp for the L93, L96, and L101 samples, respectively, whereas the average read length across all samples was 443 bp (Table 1). To remove any residual host plant transcripts and rRNA, reads were mapped to well-assembled genomes within the Asteraceae family (e.g., lettuce and sunflower) using Bowtie270, then screened with SortMeRNA v2.171 and removed. Taxonomic classification of microbial 16S and 18S rRNA reads was performed with Kraken2 v2.0.8b72 using the kraken2-microbial database (https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html) derived from the  Reference Sequence database (release 89)73. Reads counts were normalized across all three samples and only operational taxonomic units with >500 assigned reads were included and visualized with bubble plots created using the R package ggplot2 v3.3.074. The remaining metatranscriptome sequences were annotated with Trinotate v3.0 (http://trinotate.github.io) using BLAST + v2.9.075 against the Uniprot database76. No assembly was performed on the reads before the annotation, as only high-quality long reads were used in the downstream analyses; this approach has previously been used to annotate MinION-derived reads77,78. Apart from fungi, coding sequences assigned to viruses and other eukaryotes were excluded in the downstream analysis so as to focus on the microbial activity found associated with the lettuce leaf. In addition, transcripts derived from taxa assigned to Cyanobacteria, which represented a substantial number of reads (Supplementary Dataset 1), as well as transcripts associated with photosynthesis genes (Supplementary Dataset 2), were excluded to prevent the inclusion of possible misassigned chloroplast transcripts. Abundance of transcripts that had KEGG annotations79 were normalized using gene-length corrected transcripts per million method followed by Trimmed Mean of M-values method as implemented in EdgeR80. KEGG-annotated association with their respective pathways were performed using the R package KEGGREST81. Heatmaps were generated using the Broad Institute’s webtool Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The hierarchical clustering of the full heatmaps were done using the one minus Pearson’s correlation metric in Morpheus. The gene networking analysis was completed using the R package Phyloseq v1.19.180,82.

    "results": "Results Successful enrichment of the microbial RNA fraction from total RNA To ensure a comprehensive assessment of the microbes on the edible portion of the lettuce crop, both endophytic and epiphytic microbes of lettuce leaves were collected from plants grown in environmental chambers at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) that mimicked conditions used aboard the ISS. Salad crops, such as lettuce, are important target crops for establishing a sustainable source of fresh food onboard a spacecraft, as they require minimal processing and can be consumed raw. The lettuce leaves were collected from three individual plants grown for 28 days in separate pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) each derived from a single surface-sanitized seed (see “Methods”)39. From each leaf, total RNA was extracted and then the microbial RNA fraction was enriched (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1. Qubit and Bioanalyzer analysis for enriched microbial RNA from host–microbial total RNA. Open in a new tab a Quality and quantity of total RNA extracted from leaves of three individual 28-day-old Outredgeous lettuce plants (L93, L96, and L101). The table shows the amount of starting material used in the RNA extraction and total host–microbial RNA extracted for each sample. Bioanalyzer results of all three samples are shown in the digital gel image and a representative electropherogram from sample L96 shows the plant rRNA peaks. b The quality and quantity of the plant-depleted RNA were assessed. Bioanalyzer results of microbial enriched RNA are shown in the digital gel image and a representative electropherogram from sample L96 shows the microbial rRNA peak.The high quality of the RNA derived from both the host and associated microbes is depicted in Fig.1a. Effective depletion of the host RNA was observed with the mean loss of 93% of the total RNA (L93, 96.28%; L96, 88.89%; L101, 94.62%), leaving only a residual ribosomal RNA (rRNA) peak for all replicates (Fig.1b). This percentage removal of host RNA was consistent with reports from similar studies that enriched for microbial RNA40,41, indicating that the newly developed enrichment protocol for bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) was effective at removing a large quantity of plant transcripts. Overview of MinION-sequencing effectiveness of microbe-enriched metatranscriptome The extracted RNA was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA), as currently the Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-sequencing kit does not yet enable barcoding and lower levels of starting template can be used. The replicate cDNA libraries were successfully run on individual MinION flowcells and generated a mean of 10,012,033 base-called reads per replicate pot (Table 1). A detailed figure of the bioinformatic pipeline used in this study is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. After read processing and filtering, the L93, L96, and L101 samples consisted of 4,061,546 (58.34%), 10,730,313 (84.95%), and 7,361,010 (70.49%) high-quality reads, respectively (Table 1). The filtered reads were then mapped to the lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and closely related sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genomes, which are both well-characterized members of the Asteraceae family. All reads that mapped to either lettuce (L93, 19.17%; L96, 22.72%; L101, 7.23%) or sunflower (L93, 3.53%; L96, 5.52%; L101, 1.71%) were removed. Of the remaining reads, most encoded rRNAs (L93, 63.10%; L96 93.75%; L101, 69.34%) were removed for a separate taxonomic analysis. Of the rRNA transcripts, most were associated with the plant host and only the microbial 16S and non-host 18S rRNA reads were retained for taxonomic analysis with 521,345 (26.32%), 2,453,876 (33.99%), and 1,315,470 (28.31%) reads in L93, L96, and L101, respectively (Table 1).

Of the remaining non-rRNA reads, only 57,315 (4.95%), 104,111 (21.64%), and 88,850 (4.32%) reads from the samples L93, L96, and L101, respectively, had an e-value cutoff of 0.05 similar to known proteins in the UniProt Swiss-Prot database (Table 1). Those microbial transcripts that could be annotated were further mapped against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to identify those functional genes with a KEGG Orthology (KO) identifier, resulting in the annotation of 2689 transcripts in L93, 1283 transcripts in L96, and 4987 transcripts in L101 (Table 1). Taxonomic composition of 28-day-old lettuce leaf microbial community The transcriptionally active composition of the microbial communities and their relative abundance were characterized using the recovered 16S and non-host 18S rRNA transcripts to identify those taxa that associate with the lettuce leaf tissue. A total of 43 microbial phyla from all 3 microbial domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya—were identified in these samples and are listed in Supplementary Dataset 1. Focus was placed on the recovered reads associated with bacteria and fungi, and the normalized percent abundances are illustrated in Fig. 2a. Due to the potential for misaligned chloroplast transcripts, all reads that were unclassified or assigned to the Cyanobacteria phylum were excluded from the taxonomic analyses. Of the five most abundant microbial phyla in the lettuce leaf microbiomes, four were bacterial (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and one was fungal (Ascomycota), which together comprised 15.48% of the community in sample L93, 13.13% in sample L96, and 15.04% in sample L101 (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Taxonomy diversity of 16S and 18S rRNA reads in the leaf metatranscriptome samples analyzed by Kraken2. Open in a new tab a Normalized percentage abundance of all bacterial and fungal phyla within each sample. Unclassified and Cyanobacteria were not included in the bubble plot. Bubble colors for each phylum that belong to bacteria and fungi are indicated by blue and red bubbles, respectively. The size of the bubble indicates the normalized percentage abundance of each phylum. b Bubble plots illustrating the normalized counts of genera from the top 5 phyla with ≥500 normalized read counts across all three samples. The size of the bubble indicates the normalized counts for each genus.Within these five most abundant phyla, a total of 1240 genera were identified (Supplementary Dataset 1); however, only those genera that had at least 500 normalized reads in all three samples were depicted in Fig. 2b. For each genus, the percentage listed was calculated from the total number of reads for that genus across all three samples relative to the total number of reads across all samples. The top ten most abundant genera within the top five phyla included Clostridium (31.89%), Peptoniphilus (29.28%), Frondihabitans (5.74%), Lactococcus (3.64%), Bacillus (3.08%), Algoriphagus (2.96%), Fusarium (2.68%), Colletotrichum (2.43%), Actinomyces (1.91%), and Nitrosococcus (1.88%) (Fig. 2b). Together, the top eight transcriptionally active bacterial genera represented between 78.34% and 81.67% of the recovered sequences in all three replicates, whereas the two fungal genera Fusarium and Colletotrichum comprised between 4.04% and 5.96% (Fig. 2b). Functional activity of the lettuce leaf microbial community Assessment of the expressed transcripts within the lettuce leaf microbiome revealed a diverse range of functional genes associated with several key metabolic pathways in both the bacterial (Fig. 3a) and fungal (Fig. 3b) populations. Only those genes with a minimum of five transcripts across all samples were included. The full list of genes and their associated KEGG level 3 pathways are listed in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3. A total of 106 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2) and a total of 85 fungal KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 3) were observed. Fig. 3. Clustering of the top 15 bacterial and fungal metatranscriptomics data according to their KEGG pathway profiles. Open in a new tab Heatmap shows the top 15 distribution of protein-coding reads matching KEGG pathways in the a bacterial and b fungal community. The color scale shows the TMM-normalized read counts associated with each pathway. Only pathways representing more than five normalized read counts across all three samples are represented. A full version of each of these heatmap can be found in the Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.Within the lettuce-associated bacterial community, the top 15 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways comprised 94.28% of the reads that were assigned to 106 distinct pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2). The two most dominant metabolisms observed within the lettuce-associated bacterial community transcriptome were the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism with a mean of 47.64% of the transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a mean of 40.33% transcripts mapping to this pathway (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2). As visualized in the fungal metatranscriptome heatmap, the top 15 KEGG level 3 fungal pathways accounted for 84.11% of the total read counts that were assigned to 85 distinct pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Dataset 2). The two dominant fungal pathways observed in the lettuce-associated microbiome included thermogenesis with a mean of 30.43% of the annotated transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a mean of 30.25%. Interestingly, the expression of transcripts associated with several distinct signal transduction pathways was observed including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (4.10%), phospholipase D signaling pathway (1.20%), two-component system (0.74%), FoxO signaling pathway (0.63%), and Rap1 signaling pathway (0.63%) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Dataset 2). Gene network analysis of the expressed transcripts within the lettuce-associated fungal community The co-expression network within the signal transduction pathway of the fungal community was clustered by KEGG and mapped using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (cutoff = 0.5) approach in Phyloseq (Fig. 4). The nodes represent a KEGG Orthology (KO) gene and the lines (edges) represent the connection to similar expression patterns across the three samples. Shorter edges are indicative of closer connections, whereas longer edges show expression patterns that vary more between the samples. Transcripts that are found in only one sample were excluded. Both nodes and edges are color-coded to represent the KEGG level 3 pathways within the overarching KEGG level 2 signal transduction pathway. The gene network map generated showed two main clusters with high levels of connectivity. In cluster 1, genes associated with a diverse set of KEGG level 3 pathways were intertwined and observed to have some similarity in expression patterns across all three samples. The edges connecting each gene in cluster 1 were longer, which showed more variation in expression patterns between each sample. However, cluster 2 showed an enrichment of genes primarily associated with the MAPK signaling pathway that have remarkably similar expression patterns across all three samples as the edges between genes are shorter. This result suggests that the genes in the MAPK signaling pathway within the fungal community may exhibit a coordinated, co-expression pattern. Fig. 4.

    "discussion": "Discussion To prepare for a long-duration spaceflight, it will be critical to develop effective and rapid monitoring tools to evaluate changes in the microbiomes associated with both the spacecraft and the organisms within. In this study, we described such a methodology for analyzing the metatranscriptome of the microbial communities associated with lettuce crops using the nanopore MinION-sequencing platform. Specifically, we have optimized an enrichment protocol and analysis pipeline for microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA using the nanopore MinION, which can serve as a foundation for future onboard plant monitoring. In addition, the results from this study provide a first look into the metatranscriptome of the lettuce microbiome grown under ISS-like environmental conditions. By understanding the complexity of plant–microbe relationships, the underlying drivers that either maintain or perturb these associations in the space environment can be identified8. One challenge, however, is to ascertain how these changes to plant–microbe associations occur across different temporal and spatial scales. Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a viable platform to address these challenges and its applications to monitor changes in microbial communities aboard the ISS using metagenomics are now emerging34. However, its applications to examine metatranscriptome changes within a community is relatively new. One aspect of using nanopore sequencing for metatranscriptome analysis that had to be optimized was the low signal of the native surface and endophytic microbial transcripts from plant–microbial total RNA41. In this study, we developed an enrichment protocol for microbial RNAs through the depletion of plant mRNA and rRNA from the lettuce samples. As visualized in Fig. 1, there was an enrichment of the microbial RNA as the depletion of the host RNA resulted in an average loss of ~93% of the total RNA. However, it was evident that there were still residual plant RNA molecules in our library construction (Table 1). The remaining plant RNA was likely attributed to the use of a commercial plant RiboMinus kit that has not been thoroughly optimized for the lettuce species. For instance, although the lettuce 18S ribosomal sequence aligned well with the 18S probe, the incomplete lettuce 28S sequence on the  () database made it difficult to assess how well the kit would work on lettuce samples. In addition, the results also demonstrated that for long-term monitoring of specific food crops, species-specific ribosomal probes will need to be designed for host organisms to improve the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA enrichment process. Even though an average of 73.69% of the UniProt-annotated mRNA reads were mostly plant-derived, a substantial number of those reads were associated with cellular components associated with the chloroplast. Due to the similarities between chloroplast RNA and cyanobacteria42, these results suggest that removal of plant host organelle sequences through synthetic oligomers43 prior to sequencing will be required for optimum enrichment of microbial RNA. Although this protocol has the potential to be completely conducted in space by the crew, a substantial amount of refinement of our protocols coupled with technology on board the ISS will be needed to make it more practical for being performed in microgravity on a regular basis. These improvements include the automation of molecular protocols, such as sample purification and library preparation with microfluidics. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA, is currently developing tools, such as µTitan44, to facilitate autonomous nucleic acid extraction and is also working with companies such Oxford Nanopore Technologies to facilitate autonomous library preparations and magnetic purification with the VolTRAX-v2 hardware in microgravity45. Thus, this is the first step of many towards being able to investigate plant–microbial interactions on board the ISS and other low Earth orbit spacecraft. Such capabilities will ultimately advance our understanding of the plant–microbial interactions holistically in the spaceflight environment, which will allow for innovative preventative and proactive care of the crops so as to improve our ability to establish a safe and sustainable space agriculture. Currently, the sample preparation from plant tissue to library prep for MinION sequencing takes ~8 h and sequencing on the flowcell can run up to 48 h for deeper coverage. The data generated will then be put through the bioinformatics pipeline and followed by data analysis. Hence, depending on the level of detail required, monitoring the functional activity of the plant microbiome with this protocol, from harvesting samples to analyzing the generated sequences, may take ~2–5 days. Future development to optimize and automate this protocol for flight application could shorten the time requirements, which is a stark contrast to current capabilities, as it took ~12 months to determine the primary causal agent of the F. oxysporum infection on Zinnia plants on board the ISS27. In addition, this initial study provides important insight into the diversity and transcriptional activity of the L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” lettuce leaf microbiome grown under ISS-like conditions. Normalized 16S and 18S rRNA reads from each sample were categorized into 43 different phyla (Supplementary Dataset 1) and were consistent across the three biological replicates, which were each run on separate MinION flowcells. Within the top 5 phyla, 39 genera with more than 500 reads in all 3 replicates were highlighted in Fig. 3b and the most transcriptionally active bacterial taxa were Peptoniphilus spp. and Clostridium spp. Peptoniphilus are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci that uses peptone as a major energy source and produces butyrate as a major metabolic end product46. Butanoate metabolism was represented as part of the carbohydrate metabolism in the full bacterial heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2). Peptoniphilus were also found to be one of the most abundant phyllosphere taxa found on tomato leaf samples47 and are, therefore, common taxa in plant–microbe interactions. Clostridium, the other highly transcriptionally active taxa, is an extremely heterogeneous genus of bacteria that is ubiquitous in a wide range of environments, such as soil, sewage, and the intestines of humans and animals48,49. Some Clostridium species, such as Clostridium botulinum, are known pathogens that can form vegetative cells under certain conditions, which produce a fatal toxin to humans50,51. However, Clostridium species are commonly found on lettuce leaves and can be efficiently removed through proper washing of the leaves before consumption51. Therefore, these results again reinforce the importance of regular monitoring of the transcriptional and metabolic activity of taxa within plant growth habitats during spaceflight. The taxonomic results derived from this developed method differed from previous metagenomic analyses on the lettuce leaf microbiome and reinforce the importance of conducting on-site analyses of the plant microbiome17. For example, neither genera Peptoniphilus or Clostridium were observed in the previous metagenomic analysis17. In that study, the top five recovered taxa were Bacillus, Burkholderia, Macrococcus, Methylobacterium, and Staphylococcus, which were observed in our metatranscriptome data (Fig. 2b), but at lower relative abundances. Interestingly, Thermogemmatispora, which was their most abundant genera in almost all their samples, and Pelomonas were not detected in our dataset. These differences in the taxonomy diversity results between the metatranscriptomic and metagenomic approaches are not unexpected. Metagenomic analysis are based on DNA molecules, which could come from non-viable microorganisms52, whereas the metatranscriptomic approach based on the RNA molecules provides insight into the functionally active microbial community. Despite the differences in the two approaches, there were still substantial overlaps in the taxonomic composition of the lettuce microbiome, especially for the bacterial community, suggesting the nanopore sequencing of the metatranscriptome was highly complementary to the previous metagenomic studies on lettuce microbiome17. Within the observed fungal community, the most transcriptionally active taxa were Fusarium spp. and Colletotrichum spp. (Fig. 2b). Both these genera are known to have species with strains that are plant pathogens. These cosmopolitan fungi have a broad range of hosts and can cause wilt diseases and anthracnose attacks in many major agricultural crops53–55. However, as there are many species and strains within each of these genera of fungi that are not pathogenic, the specific ecological role of the recovered taxa could not be fully assessed. The use of this nanopore metatranscriptomic sequencing approach could be used to prioritize samples and taxa for downstream in-depth sequencing, to ascertain the pathogenic potential, if any, of recovered fungal taxa. The metatranscriptomic analyses of the transcribed functional genes of the bacterial and fungal community were largely consistent with the core functional microbiome in other phyllosphere microbial systems reported in the literature56,57. In our study, within the top 15 most actively transcribed bacterial pathways (Fig.3a), “Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” had 47.64% of the total reads and “Oxidative phosphorylation” had 40.33% of the total reads. This result was not unexpected, because glyoxylate metabolism is known to be involved in the metabolism of short carbon compounds (one or two carbons), which are an important energy source for leaf-associated bacteria58. Oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, as the end product is adenosine triphosphate and is required for a myriad of cellular processes. Most of the top bacterial pathways listed in our study (Fig. 3) are typically involved in essential housekeeping activities and are necessary for bacterial survival. However, signal transduction and environmental adaptation pathways could provide some indication as to how the plants are responding to their environment. For example, the high number of reads that mapped to the two-component system pathway might suggest the need to sense and quickly respond to environmental factors by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating proteins, whereas the plant–pathogen interaction pathway could indicate a biotic stress response59. In the fungal metatranscriptome, “Oxidative phosphorylation” and “Thermogenesis” were the most actively transcribed pathways. In addition to oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondria also engage in thermogenesis, which uncouples the oxidative phosphorylation for heat production in organisms60. However, intriguingly, about a quarter of all the KEGG level 3 pathways listed (Supplementary Fig. 3) were associated with the signal transduction pathway. Many of these were also seen in the top 15 most actively transcribed fungal pathways (Fig. 3b). The most actively transcribed signal transduction pathway in the fungal metatranscriptome was the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 3b). The MAPK pathway plays important roles in fungal physiology and development, as it governs diverse growth processes such as mating, cell cycle control, morphogenesis (e.g., filamentation), response to different stresses, cell wall assembly and integrity, pathogenicity, cell to cell signaling, fungal–plant interactions, and response to damage-associated molecular patterns61–63. From our metatranscriptomic dataset, we can map genes expressed to specific processes within the MAPK signaling pathway in yeast (Supplementary Fig. 4). This result suggests that the fungi within the lettuce microbiome may be actively engaged in cell wall remodeling and proliferation. Moreover, the gene network mapping of the signal transduction transcripts showed high levels for connectivity of genes (i.e., SST2, STE7, GDP1, SHO1, and CLA4) within the MAPK pathways, which indicates that these are tightly connected processes in the fungal community (Fig. 4). Interestingly, many of these genes also overlap with fungal pathogenesis61,64 and, although this does not necessarily indicate active pathogenicity, it would be beneficial for the crew to monitor these genes over time in their food crops. Currently, many of the commercially available portable rapid plant disease diagnostic tools are based on immunodetection methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), PCR-based assays, and spectrometry-based protocols, which require some prior prediction of the microbial organisms that are being tested, to design antibodies or PCR primers for the analyses65,66. The MinION platform has great advantages when dealing with diagnosing plant pathogens and plant–microbial analysis, as it uses shotgun sequencing technology that requires no prior knowledge or prediction about the possible causative agent. The detection of any microbial organisms, even at low levels, is limited to the microbial sequences available in the  database. Although this study described the analysis of the lettuce microbiome at a single time point, the methodology developed in this study has the potential to enable the comparative analyses of the lettuce microbiome across spatial and temporal scales to identify potential drivers of change during plant growth and development. The complementary use of rapid nanopore-sequencing approaches with additional more in-depth metagenomic sequencing of viable microorganisms will enable baselines of health to be regularly monitored in plant growth habitats aboard spacecraft. These comparisons will also enable more refined approaches to understand how the microbiome changes under environmental perturbations and contributes to healthy plant growth and development during a long-duration spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 8211661 PMID: 34140518 Abstract Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production. Subject terms: Microbiology, Plant sciencesIntroduction As humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned missions to the Moon and cis-lunar orbit, it has become evident that growing plants for food and other life support systems is essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4. To ensure that these future missions are successful, it is necessary to investigate all aspects of the basic physiological and molecular responses of food crops and their microbiomes to the spaceflight environment, so that any issues faced on these missions can be efficiently managed and mitigated on-orbit. Plants have complex and dynamic relationships with their microorganisms, which are influenced by various stresses and environmental factors, including spaceflight5–9. The novel environments of spaceflight and microgravity analogs have been shown to alter the plant–microbe interactions at both the genetic and physiological levels, oftentimes resulting in increased susceptibility to diseases10–14. For example, soybean seedlings grown in spaceflight are more susceptible to the colonization of fungal pathogen, Phytophthora sojae, when compared to ground controls10. In addition, simulated microgravity experiments have demonstrated that clinorotation reduces the growth and development of the legume Medicargo truncatula and significantly affects its symbiotic relationship with the rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus irregularis15. Specifically, nodule size and number were reduced under clinorotation when compared to static controls15. Moreover, in another simulated microgravity experiment performed on random positioning machines, the endophytic bacterial diversity in wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings behaves differently under simulated microgravity when compared to normal gravity controls14. Specifically, some bacterial genera (e.g., Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, and Bacillus) that can produce plant growth-promoting and antimicrobial substances, exhibit clear differences in relative abundance between microgravity and Earth gravity treatments14. However, research on how microgravity impacts plant–microbe interactions is still in its infancy. It is, therefore, critical to develop efficient methods for investigating plant–microbe interactions to expand our current knowledge base for future space exploration. The dynamic nature of plant–microbial interactions requires regular monitoring of a crop’s microbiome and its metabolic activities to assess plant health. These measures together with other surveillance techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) will ensure that successful cultivation of crops on long-duration missions in space can be accomplished. To date, plants have been successfully grown in space in multiple hardware systems, such as the Vegetable Production System (Veggie), Advanced Plant Habitat, and the LADA greenhouse16. For example, edible leafy crops have been safely produced in the Veggie hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumed by crew members17. There have been, however, sporadic instances of contamination with opportunistic fungal pathogens. In a Veggie experiment (VEG-01C), Zinnia hybrida plants were infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum18,19. F. oxysporum is a ubiquitous group of soilborne fungi that are highly adaptable to different habitats and include non-pathogenic strains, plant pathogens, and even opportunistic human pathogens20. Pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum can cause Fusarium wilt in nearly every agriculturally important crop21. Some multi-host isolates in plants also have the potential to cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised mammals22–25. Even though the fungal infection on the Zinnia plants was likely due to a malfunction of a fan in the Veggie hardware26, it demonstrated the importance of characterizing the healthy basal microbiome of all plants cultivated in space. To achieve this goal, methodologies are needed to regularly monitor changes in the microbial community during flight to potentially mitigate the rise of pathogenic taxa. Currently, the standard protocol for the investigation of plant–pathogen interactions aboard the ISS is to harvest the plant material, freeze it, and return it to Earth for analysis27. However, with future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit likely taking up to 6 months between resupply missions, it will be critical to develop faster, on-side methodologies to regularly monitor and assess plant–microbe health. Here we present a method for using metatranscriptomics coupled with nanopore sequencing to characterize the plant microbiome and their functional activity from plant–microbe total RNA samples that could be feasibly completed on-orbit. Metatranscriptomics has emerged as an effective methodology to characterize the plant microbiome and evaluate its transcriptional activity28. Transcriptional surveys, among many others, enable the identification and assessment of the main drivers of changes in plant health29–32. However, to date, metatranscriptomic studies of plant microbiomes have all utilized Illumina sequencing platforms, which are not feasible for spaceflight applications due to their large up-mass, weight, and footprint. The pocket-sized, USB-powered nanopore MinION, sequencing platform, which weighs <100 g and is capable of single-molecule sequencing of native full-length DNA and RNA molecules33, has emerged as a viable sequence platform for spaceflight. In 2016, the nanopore-sequencing system was successfully used aboard the ISS for DNA analysis and compared to next-generation sequencing platforms, such as Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII34. Although the nanopore system has been successfully used for DNA applications, its use for metatranscriptomic analyses is only now emerging35–38 and has not yet been used to analyze the metatranscriptome of microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA samples. As a proof-of-concept, we have characterized the microbiome of red romaine lettuce grown under a baseline condition (i.e., ISS-like ground controls) using MinION-based metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that plants can be rapidly and effectively screened using this molecular approach. By developing reliable methodologies to regularly monitor and compare changes in the functional activity of the plant microorganisms over time, early detection of opportunistic pathogens can help inform mitigation strategies and provide important insight into agricultural practices aboard spacecraft to maximize crop production and ensure crew safety on long-duration missions.Results Successful enrichment of the microbial RNA fraction from total RNA To ensure a comprehensive assessment of the microbes on the edible portion of the lettuce crop, both endophytic and epiphytic microbes of lettuce leaves were collected from plants grown in environmental chambers at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) that mimicked conditions used aboard the ISS. Salad crops, such as lettuce, are important target crops for establishing a sustainable source of fresh food onboard a spacecraft, as they require minimal processing and can be consumed raw. The lettuce leaves were collected from three individual plants grown for 28 days in separate pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) each derived from a single surface-sanitized seed (see “Methods”)39. From each leaf, total RNA was extracted and then the microbial RNA fraction was enriched (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1. Qubit and Bioanalyzer analysis for enriched microbial RNA from host–microbial total RNA. Open in a new tab a Quality and quantity of total RNA extracted from leaves of three individual 28-day-old Outredgeous lettuce plants (L93, L96, and L101). The table shows the amount of starting material used in the RNA extraction and total host–microbial RNA extracted for each sample. Bioanalyzer results of all three samples are shown in the digital gel image and a representative electropherogram from sample L96 shows the plant rRNA peaks. b The quality and quantity of the plant-depleted RNA were assessed. Bioanalyzer results of microbial enriched RNA are shown in the digital gel image and a representative electropherogram from sample L96 shows the microbial rRNA peak.The high quality of the RNA derived from both the host and associated microbes is depicted in Fig.1a. Effective depletion of the host RNA was observed with the mean loss of 93% of the total RNA (L93, 96.28%; L96, 88.89%; L101, 94.62%), leaving only a residual ribosomal RNA (rRNA) peak for all replicates (Fig.1b). This percentage removal of host RNA was consistent with reports from similar studies that enriched for microbial RNA40,41, indicating that the newly developed enrichment protocol for bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) was effective at removing a large quantity of plant transcripts.Overview of MinION-sequencing effectiveness of microbe-enriched metatranscriptome The extracted RNA was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA), as currently the Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-sequencing kit does not yet enable barcoding and lower levels of starting template can be used. The replicate cDNA libraries were successfully run on individual MinION flowcells and generated a mean of 10,012,033 base-called reads per replicate pot (Table 1). A detailed figure of the bioinformatic pipeline used in this study is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. After read processing and filtering, the L93, L96, and L101 samples consisted of 4,061,546 (58.34%), 10,730,313 (84.95%), and 7,361,010 (70.49%) high-quality reads, respectively (Table 1). The filtered reads were then mapped to the lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and closely related sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genomes, which are both well-characterized members of the Asteraceae family. All reads that mapped to either lettuce (L93, 19.17%; L96, 22.72%; L101, 7.23%) or sunflower (L93, 3.53%; L96, 5.52%; L101, 1.71%) were removed. Of the remaining reads, most encoded rRNAs (L93, 63.10%; L96 93.75%; L101, 69.34%) were removed for a separate taxonomic analysis. Of the rRNA transcripts, most were associated with the plant host and only the microbial 16S and non-host 18S rRNA reads were retained for taxonomic analysis with 521,345 (26.32%), 2,453,876 (33.99%), and 1,315,470 (28.31%) reads in L93, L96, and L101, respectively (Table 1).

Of the remaining non-rRNA reads, only 57,315 (4.95%), 104,111 (21.64%), and 88,850 (4.32%) reads from the samples L93, L96, and L101, respectively, had an e-value cutoff of 0.05 similar to known proteins in the UniProt Swiss-Prot database (Table 1). Those microbial transcripts that could be annotated were further mapped against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to identify those functional genes with a KEGG Orthology (KO) identifier, resulting in the annotation of 2689 transcripts in L93, 1283 transcripts in L96, and 4987 transcripts in L101 (Table 1).Taxonomic composition of 28-day-old lettuce leaf microbial community The transcriptionally active composition of the microbial communities and their relative abundance were characterized using the recovered 16S and non-host 18S rRNA transcripts to identify those taxa that associate with the lettuce leaf tissue. A total of 43 microbial phyla from all 3 microbial domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya—were identified in these samples and are listed in Supplementary Dataset 1. Focus was placed on the recovered reads associated with bacteria and fungi, and the normalized percent abundances are illustrated in Fig. 2a. Due to the potential for misaligned chloroplast transcripts, all reads that were unclassified or assigned to the Cyanobacteria phylum were excluded from the taxonomic analyses. Of the five most abundant microbial phyla in the lettuce leaf microbiomes, four were bacterial (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and one was fungal (Ascomycota), which together comprised 15.48% of the community in sample L93, 13.13% in sample L96, and 15.04% in sample L101 (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Taxonomy diversity of 16S and 18S rRNA reads in the leaf metatranscriptome samples analyzed by Kraken2. Open in a new tab a Normalized percentage abundance of all bacterial and fungal phyla within each sample. Unclassified and Cyanobacteria were not included in the bubble plot.

The size of the bubble indicates the normalized counts for each genus.Within these five most abundant phyla, a total of 1240 genera were identified (Supplementary Dataset 1); however, only those genera that had at least 500 normalized reads in all three samples were depicted in Fig. 2b. For each genus, the percentage listed was calculated from the total number of reads for that genus across all three samples relative to the total number of reads across all samples. The top ten most abundant genera within the top five phyla included Clostridium (31.89%), Peptoniphilus (29.28%), Frondihabitans (5.74%), Lactococcus (3.64%), Bacillus (3.08%), Algoriphagus (2.96%), Fusarium (2.68%), Colletotrichum (2.43%), Actinomyces (1.91%), and Nitrosococcus (1.88%) (Fig. 2b). Together, the top eight transcriptionally active bacterial genera represented between 78.34% and 81.67% of the recovered sequences in all three replicates, whereas the two fungal genera Fusarium and Colletotrichum comprised between 4.04% and 5.96% (Fig. 2b).Functional activity of the lettuce leaf microbial community Assessment of the expressed transcripts within the lettuce leaf microbiome revealed a diverse range of functional genes associated with several key metabolic pathways in both the bacterial (Fig. 3a) and fungal (Fig. 3b) populations. Only those genes with a minimum of five transcripts across all samples were included. The full list of genes and their associated KEGG level 3 pathways are listed in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3. A total of 106 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2) and a total of 85 fungal KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 3) were observed. Fig. 3. Clustering of the top 15 bacterial and fungal metatranscriptomics data according to their KEGG pathway profiles. Open in a new tab Heatmap shows the top 15 distribution of protein-coding reads matching KEGG pathways in the a bacterial and b fungal community. The color scale shows the TMM-normalized read counts associated with each pathway. Only pathways representing more than five normalized read counts across all three samples are represented. A full version of each of these heatmap can be found in the Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.Within the lettuce-associated bacterial community, the top 15 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways comprised 94.28% of the reads that were assigned to 106 distinct pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2). The two most dominant metabolisms observed within the lettuce-associated bacterial community transcriptome were the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism with a mean of 47.64% of the transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a mean of 40.33% transcripts mapping to this pathway (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2). As visualized in the fungal metatranscriptome heatmap, the top 15 KEGG level 3 fungal pathways accounted for 84.11% of the total read counts that were assigned to 85 distinct pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Dataset 2). The two dominant fungal pathways observed in the lettuce-associated microbiome included thermogenesis with a mean of 30.43% of the annotated transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a mean of 30.25%. Interestingly, the expression of transcripts associated with several distinct signal transduction pathways was observed including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (4.10%), phospholipase D signaling pathway (1.20%), two-component system (0.74%), FoxO signaling pathway (0.63%), and Rap1 signaling pathway (0.63%) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Dataset 2).Gene network analysis of the expressed transcripts within the lettuce-associated fungal community The co-expression network within the signal transduction pathway of the fungal community was clustered by KEGG and mapped using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (cutoff = 0.5) approach in Phyloseq (Fig. 4). The nodes represent a KEGG Orthology (KO) gene and the lines (edges) represent the connection to similar expression patterns across the three samples. Shorter edges are indicative of closer connections, whereas longer edges show expression patterns that vary more between the samples. Transcripts that are found in only one sample were excluded. Both nodes and edges are color-coded to represent the KEGG level 3 pathways within the overarching KEGG level 2 signal transduction pathway. The gene network map generated showed two main clusters with high levels of connectivity. In cluster 1, genes associated with a diverse set of KEGG level 3 pathways were intertwined and observed to have some similarity in expression patterns across all three samples. The edges connecting each gene in cluster 1 were longer, which showed more variation in expression patterns between each sample. However, cluster 2 showed an enrichment of genes primarily associated with the MAPK signaling pathway that have remarkably similar expression patterns across all three samples as the edges between genes are shorter. This result suggests that the genes in the MAPK signaling pathway within the fungal community may exhibit a coordinated, co-expression pattern. Fig. 4.

In this study, we described such a methodology for analyzing the metatranscriptome of the microbial communities associated with lettuce crops using the nanopore MinION-sequencing platform. Specifically, we have optimized an enrichment protocol and analysis pipeline for microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA using the nanopore MinION, which can serve as a foundation for future onboard plant monitoring. In addition, the results from this study provide a first look into the metatranscriptome of the lettuce microbiome grown under ISS-like environmental conditions. By understanding the complexity of plant–microbe relationships, the underlying drivers that either maintain or perturb these associations in the space environment can be identified8. One challenge, however, is to ascertain how these changes to plant–microbe associations occur across different temporal and spatial scales. Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a viable platform to address these challenges and its applications to monitor changes in microbial communities aboard the ISS using metagenomics are now emerging34. However, its applications to examine metatranscriptome changes within a community is relatively new. One aspect of using nanopore sequencing for metatranscriptome analysis that had to be optimized was the low signal of the native surface and endophytic microbial transcripts from plant–microbial total RNA41. In this study, we developed an enrichment protocol for microbial RNAs through the depletion of plant mRNA and rRNA from the lettuce samples. As visualized in Fig. 1, there was an enrichment of the microbial RNA as the depletion of the host RNA resulted in an average loss of ~93% of the total RNA. However, it was evident that there were still residual plant RNA molecules in our library construction (Table 1). The remaining plant RNA was likely attributed to the use of a commercial plant RiboMinus kit that has not been thoroughly optimized for the lettuce species. For instance, although the lettuce 18S ribosomal sequence aligned well with the 18S probe, the incomplete lettuce 28S sequence on the  () database made it difficult to assess how well the kit would work on lettuce samples. In addition, the results also demonstrated that for long-term monitoring of specific food crops, species-specific ribosomal probes will need to be designed for host organisms to improve the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA enrichment process. Even though an average of 73.69% of the UniProt-annotated mRNA reads were mostly plant-derived, a substantial number of those reads were associated with cellular components associated with the chloroplast. Due to the similarities between chloroplast RNA and cyanobacteria42, these results suggest that removal of plant host organelle sequences through synthetic oligomers43 prior to sequencing will be required for optimum enrichment of microbial RNA. Although this protocol has the potential to be completely conducted in space by the crew, a substantial amount of refinement of our protocols coupled with technology on board the ISS will be needed to make it more practical for being performed in microgravity on a regular basis. These improvements include the automation of molecular protocols, such as sample purification and library preparation with microfluidics. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA, is currently developing tools, such as µTitan44, to facilitate autonomous nucleic acid extraction and is also working with companies such Oxford Nanopore Technologies to facilitate autonomous library preparations and magnetic purification with the VolTRAX-v2 hardware in microgravity45. Thus, this is the first step of many towards being able to investigate plant–microbial interactions on board the ISS and other low Earth orbit spacecraft. Such capabilities will ultimately advance our understanding of the plant–microbial interactions holistically in the spaceflight environment, which will allow for innovative preventative and proactive care of the crops so as to improve our ability to establish a safe and sustainable space agriculture. Currently, the sample preparation from plant tissue to library prep for MinION sequencing takes ~8 h and sequencing on the flowcell can run up to 48 h for deeper coverage. The data generated will then be put through the bioinformatics pipeline and followed by data analysis. Hence, depending on the level of detail required, monitoring the functional activity of the plant microbiome with this protocol, from harvesting samples to analyzing the generated sequences, may take ~2–5 days. Future development to optimize and automate this protocol for flight application could shorten the time requirements, which is a stark contrast to current capabilities, as it took ~12 months to determine the primary causal agent of the F. oxysporum infection on Zinnia plants on board the ISS27. In addition, this initial study provides important insight into the diversity and transcriptional activity of the L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” lettuce leaf microbiome grown under ISS-like conditions. Normalized 16S and 18S rRNA reads from each sample were categorized into 43 different phyla (Supplementary Dataset 1) and were consistent across the three biological replicates, which were each run on separate MinION flowcells. Within the top 5 phyla, 39 genera with more than 500 reads in all 3 replicates were highlighted in Fig. 3b and the most transcriptionally active bacterial taxa were Peptoniphilus spp. and Clostridium spp. Peptoniphilus are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci that uses peptone as a major energy source and produces butyrate as a major metabolic end product46. Butanoate metabolism was represented as part of the carbohydrate metabolism in the full bacterial heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2). Peptoniphilus were also found to be one of the most abundant phyllosphere taxa found on tomato leaf samples47 and are, therefore, common taxa in plant–microbe interactions. Clostridium, the other highly transcriptionally active taxa, is an extremely heterogeneous genus of bacteria that is ubiquitous in a wide range of environments, such as soil, sewage, and the intestines of humans and animals48,49. Some Clostridium species, such as Clostridium botulinum, are known pathogens that can form vegetative cells under certain conditions, which produce a fatal toxin to humans50,51. However, Clostridium species are commonly found on lettuce leaves and can be efficiently removed through proper washing of the leaves before consumption51. Therefore, these results again reinforce the importance of regular monitoring of the transcriptional and metabolic activity of taxa within plant growth habitats during spaceflight. The taxonomic results derived from this developed method differed from previous metagenomic analyses on the lettuce leaf microbiome and reinforce the importance of conducting on-site analyses of the plant microbiome17. For example, neither genera Peptoniphilus or Clostridium were observed in the previous metagenomic analysis17. In that study, the top five recovered taxa were Bacillus, Burkholderia, Macrococcus, Methylobacterium, and Staphylococcus, which were observed in our metatranscriptome data (Fig. 2b), but at lower relative abundances. Interestingly, Thermogemmatispora, which was their most abundant genera in almost all their samples, and Pelomonas were not detected in our dataset. These differences in the taxonomy diversity results between the metatranscriptomic and metagenomic approaches are not unexpected. Metagenomic analysis are based on DNA molecules, which could come from non-viable microorganisms52, whereas the metatranscriptomic approach based on the RNA molecules provides insight into the functionally active microbial community. Despite the differences in the two approaches, there were still substantial overlaps in the taxonomic composition of the lettuce microbiome, especially for the bacterial community, suggesting the nanopore sequencing of the metatranscriptome was highly complementary to the previous metagenomic studies on lettuce microbiome17. Within the observed fungal community, the most transcriptionally active taxa were Fusarium spp. and Colletotrichum spp. (Fig. 2b). Both these genera are known to have species with strains that are plant pathogens. These cosmopolitan fungi have a broad range of hosts and can cause wilt diseases and anthracnose attacks in many major agricultural crops53–55. However, as there are many species and strains within each of these genera of fungi that are not pathogenic, the specific ecological role of the recovered taxa could not be fully assessed. The use of this nanopore metatranscriptomic sequencing approach could be used to prioritize samples and taxa for downstream in-depth sequencing, to ascertain the pathogenic potential, if any, of recovered fungal taxa. The metatranscriptomic analyses of the transcribed functional genes of the bacterial and fungal community were largely consistent with the core functional microbiome in other phyllosphere microbial systems reported in the literature56,57. In our study, within the top 15 most actively transcribed bacterial pathways (Fig.3a), “Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” had 47.64% of the total reads and “Oxidative phosphorylation” had 40.33% of the total reads. This result was not unexpected, because glyoxylate metabolism is known to be involved in the metabolism of short carbon compounds (one or two carbons), which are an important energy source for leaf-associated bacteria58. Oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, as the end product is adenosine triphosphate and is required for a myriad of cellular processes. Most of the top bacterial pathways listed in our study (Fig. 3) are typically involved in essential housekeeping activities and are necessary for bacterial survival. However, signal transduction and environmental adaptation pathways could provide some indication as to how the plants are responding to their environment. For example, the high number of reads that mapped to the two-component system pathway might suggest the need to sense and quickly respond to environmental factors by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating proteins, whereas the plant–pathogen interaction pathway could indicate a biotic stress response59. In the fungal metatranscriptome, “Oxidative phosphorylation” and “Thermogenesis” were the most actively transcribed pathways. In addition to oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondria also engage in thermogenesis, which uncouples the oxidative phosphorylation for heat production in organisms60. However, intriguingly, about a quarter of all the KEGG level 3 pathways listed (Supplementary Fig. 3) were associated with the signal transduction pathway. Many of these were also seen in the top 15 most actively transcribed fungal pathways (Fig. 3b). The most actively transcribed signal transduction pathway in the fungal metatranscriptome was the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 3b). The MAPK pathway plays important roles in fungal physiology and development, as it governs diverse growth processes such as mating, cell cycle control, morphogenesis (e.g., filamentation), response to different stresses, cell wall assembly and integrity, pathogenicity, cell to cell signaling, fungal–plant interactions, and response to damage-associated molecular patterns61–63. From our metatranscriptomic dataset, we can map genes expressed to specific processes within the MAPK signaling pathway in yeast (Supplementary Fig. 4). This result suggests that the fungi within the lettuce microbiome may be actively engaged in cell wall remodeling and proliferation. Moreover, the gene network mapping of the signal transduction transcripts showed high levels for connectivity of genes (i.e., SST2, STE7, GDP1, SHO1, and CLA4) within the MAPK pathways, which indicates that these are tightly connected processes in the fungal community (Fig. 4). Interestingly, many of these genes also overlap with fungal pathogenesis61,64 and, although this does not necessarily indicate active pathogenicity, it would be beneficial for the crew to monitor these genes over time in their food crops. Currently, many of the commercially available portable rapid plant disease diagnostic tools are based on immunodetection methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), PCR-based assays, and spectrometry-based protocols, which require some prior prediction of the microbial organisms that are being tested, to design antibodies or PCR primers for the analyses65,66. The MinION platform has great advantages when dealing with diagnosing plant pathogens and plant–microbial analysis, as it uses shotgun sequencing technology that requires no prior knowledge or prediction about the possible causative agent. The detection of any microbial organisms, even at low levels, is limited to the microbial sequences available in the  database. Although this study described the analysis of the lettuce microbiome at a single time point, the methodology developed in this study has the potential to enable the comparative analyses of the lettuce microbiome across spatial and temporal scales to identify potential drivers of change during plant growth and development. The complementary use of rapid nanopore-sequencing approaches with additional more in-depth metagenomic sequencing of viable microorganisms will enable baselines of health to be regularly monitored in plant growth habitats aboard spacecraft. These comparisons will also enable more refined approaches to understand how the microbiome changes under environmental perturbations and contributes to healthy plant growth and development during a long-duration spaceflight.Methods Sample collection and RNA extraction Seeds of red romaine lettuce, L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” were surface-sanitized with a bleach-hydrochloric acid solution (30 ml 6% Pure Bright Germicidal Ultra Bleach and 500 μl 37% hydrochloric acid) for 1 h and allowed to off-gas for 24 h prior to planting. Sanitization was verified by placing seeds on trypticase soy agar and inhibitory mold agar plates, and incubating for 48–72 h at 30 °C18. A standard validation protocol was used to conform the effectiveness of the sanitization protocol26. No bacterial or fungal growth was observed on the plates during the screening process. Three surface-sanitized seeds were individually placed in 4 inch pots containing greens-grade arcillite, a calcined clay and time-release fertilizer typically used in spaceflight hardware26, and were grown in environmentally controlled growth chambers at the KSC that mimicked conditions of the ISS. The growth chambers were cleaned to remove any potential human-associated microbes before use, but were not sterilized. To simulate conditions aboard the ISS, the plants were maintained at 50% relative humidity, 3000 p.p.m. CO2, and 23 °C. The growth cycle was established on a 16 h (light)/8 h (dark) cycle under fluorescent cool white lights (200–300 μE m−2 s−1) and all were on daily automatic watering with deionized water. Pots were thinned to one plant each at day 7 and samples were harvested at day 28 for leafy greens. Lettuce leaf tissue from each of the three pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) was placed immediately into RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and stored at −80 °C until ready for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from each of the three lettuce leave replicates with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The recovered RNA was DNase-treated with the optional on-column digestion following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified using Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A sample of clean RNAlater was used as a negative control throughout the sample preparation process. No RNA was obtained or amplified from the negative control sample.Enrichment of microbial transcripts An enrichment method was developed to enable the separation of plant and microbial RNAs for subsequent sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore-sequencing technology41. Using the recovered host–microbial total RNA (7.33–23.56 µg), the Dynabeads poly(A) capture protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed to remove poly(A)-containing RNAs (e.g., plant mRNAs). Of note, plants and fungi both have poly(A)-containing mRNA. It is therefore likely that some of the fungal RNA were also removed during the enrichment process. The remaining poly(A)-depleted material (microbial mRNA/rRNA and plant rRNA) was then purified with the Zymo RNA clean and concentration kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The remaining RNAs were processed using the RiboMinus Plant Kit for the removal of plant rRNA as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The host-depleted RNA (1–10 μg) from each sample was then A-tailed using Poly(A) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 25 min at 37 °C. The enriched microbial RNA (mRNA and rRNA) quantity was assessed with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and quality was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). To assess the purity of RNA, A260/280 readings were also taken with the UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The samples were stored at −80 °C until library preparation.Nanopore cDNA-PCR library preparation Library preparation for cDNA-PCR sequencing was performed using the SQK-PCS109 sequencing kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Briefly, 50 ng of enriched microbial RNA samples from L93, L96, and L101 were reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and incubated in a thermal cycler at 42 °C for 90 min and then 85 °C for 5 min. To amplify the products without introducing biases, full-length transcripts were selected using the Nanopore rapid attachment primers (SQK-PCS109) using LongAmp Taq 2× Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with the following cycling conditions, an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 62 °C, and 1 min at 65 °C, and a final extension step at 65 °C for 6 min and a hold at 4 °C. The products were then purified and separated using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) with 1.8 (v/v) ratio of magnetic beads to the reaction mixture. The cDNA library using 100 fmol of amplified cDNA with adapters was loaded onto a FLO-MIN106D R9 flowcell and sequencing was performed with a MinION device for 48 h. cDNA derived from each replicate (L93, L96, L101) were sequenced on individual flowcells to provide information about the process reproducibility and variability. Bioinformatics and data analysis RNA-sequencing data were base-called in real-time using an integrated version of Guppy in the MinKNOW software v3.3.2 via the MinIT device v19.05.2. All FASTQ files were concatenated and used in the bioinformatics pipeline illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. Briefly, MinION-sequencing statistics were analyzed using Nanoplot v1.0.067 and adapters were trimmed using Porechop v0.2.468. Reads were filtered for a minimum read length of 100 bp and minimum Q-score of 5 using filtlong v0.2.0 was to ensure that >80% of the reads in all three samples were as previously described69. Large chimeric reads of >30,000 bp were also filtered out using a Unix shell command. The N50 read length, which is defined as the read length such that reads of this length or greater composes at least 50% of the total bases, was 417, 616, and 512 bp for the L93, L96, and L101 samples, respectively, whereas the average read length across all samples was 443 bp (Table 1). To remove any residual host plant transcripts and rRNA, reads were mapped to well-assembled genomes within the Asteraceae family (e.g., lettuce and sunflower) using Bowtie270, then screened with SortMeRNA v2.171 and removed. Taxonomic classification of microbial 16S and 18S rRNA reads was performed with Kraken2 v2.0.8b72 using the kraken2-microbial database (https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html) derived from the  Reference Sequence database (release 89)73. Reads counts were normalized across all three samples and only operational taxonomic units with >500 assigned reads were included and visualized with bubble plots created using the R package ggplot2 v3.3.074. The remaining metatranscriptome sequences were annotated with Trinotate v3.0 (http://trinotate.github.io) using BLAST + v2.9.075 against the Uniprot database76. No assembly was performed on the reads before the annotation, as only high-quality long reads were used in the downstream analyses; this approach has previously been used to annotate MinION-derived reads77,78. Apart from fungi, coding sequences assigned to viruses and other eukaryotes were excluded in the downstream analysis so as to focus on the microbial activity found associated with the lettuce leaf. In addition, transcripts derived from taxa assigned to Cyanobacteria, which represented a substantial number of reads (Supplementary Dataset 1), as well as transcripts associated with photosynthesis genes (Supplementary Dataset 2), were excluded to prevent the inclusion of possible misassigned chloroplast transcripts. Abundance of transcripts that had KEGG annotations79 were normalized using gene-length corrected transcripts per million method followed by Trimmed Mean of M-values method as implemented in EdgeR80. KEGG-annotated association with their respective pathways were performed using the R package KEGGREST81. Heatmaps were generated using the Broad Institute’s webtool Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The hierarchical clustering of the full heatmaps were done using the one minus Pearson’s correlation metric in Morpheus. The gene networking analysis was completed using the R package Phyloseq v1.19.180,82.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (1.3MB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (2MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (147.4KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (66.4KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NASA through the University of Central Florida’s NASA Florida Space Consortium and Space Florida (NX15AI10H) awarded to J.S.F.

    "abstract": "Abstract Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The space environment is extremely complex, characterized by strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity, as well as other environmental factors [1,2]. These factors are collectively referred to as space composite stress, which can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [3,4]. Microgravity, in particular, is a significant factor affecting the health of astronauts aboard a spacecraft and has therefore received considerable attention from researchers [5]. This is primarily because weightlessness not only leads to the redistribution of body fluids towards the head but also deprives the human body of gravitational load. Prolonged stays in space can increase the risks of decreased cardiovascular capacity, impaired immune system, reduced bone density, neurological disorders, and muscle atrophy [6,7,8]. When a spacecraft carrying astronauts rotates around the Earth, the interior is theoretically a zero-gravity environment. However, due to the influence of residual atmospheric drag and the spacecraft’s rotation, the interior actually exhibits a microgravity environment [9]. Nevertheless, true space flight experiments are rarely conducted due to their scarcity of opportunities, high costs, and operational complexity. As a result, most research on the effects of microgravity on the human body is conducted through ground-based simulation experiments, with actual flight tests providing supplementary validation [10]. Ground-based simulation studies of microgravity effects can provide referable data and experimental methods for actual space flight experiments. These simulations are crucial for understanding the physiological impacts of microgravity and developing countermeasures to protect astronaut health during space missions. Exploring the role of microgravity in the damage caused by space composite stress has become an important topic in ground-based experiments in recent years [11,12]. Various damages or abnormalities caused by microgravity in the body are collectively referred to as microgravity effects. The microgravity effects are mainly manifested as changes in multiple physiological systems such as the cardiovascular, liver, bone, muscle, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [13,14,15]. In recent years, researchers have conducted studies on multiple physiological systems related to microgravity, either independently or focusing on some of their interactive effects. However, these studies mainly concentrate on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, while there are relatively few studies on the liver–brain system, especially on its mechanisms. The liver, as the largest internal organ involved in detoxification and metabolism to maintain the body’s homeostasis, experiences significant gravitational changes. Comparisons between flight specimens and ground controls have shown that among ten types of mouse tissues including muscle, eyes, and kidneys, the liver has the largest number of differentially expressed genes and proteins [16]. As an important detoxification organ for preventing physical injuries caused by space risks, the liver also has a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs taken during spaceflight [17,18]. In addition, microgravity exposure can lead to liver dysfunction, resulting in liver injuries and inflammation related to apoptosis and oxidative stress, impaired metabolism, changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism, and lipid deposition [14]. Obviously, these dysfunctions are related to changes in liver metabolism or morphological structure caused by microgravity. Specifically, the major pathophysiological steps involved in these processes are summarized as follows: (1) apoptosis and oxidative stress: microgravity can disrupt the intracellular redox balance, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [19,20]. Excessive ROS can attack biomacromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA within liver cells, causing oxidative damage. Microgravity also activates apoptotic signaling pathways in liver cells, such as the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, microgravity induces changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing cytochrome c to be released into the cytoplasm. This activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3, triggering cell apoptosis; (2) inflammatory response: microgravity can induce or exacerbate liver injury by stimulating the release of inflammatory factors and the infiltration of inflammatory cells [21]; (3) metabolic impairment: microgravity affects pathways or enzymes related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein metabolism [22], leading to metabolic abnormalities of glucose, lipids, and proteins; (4) changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism: microgravity can influence the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (such as the CYP450 enzyme system) in the liver, as well as alter the expression levels of drug transporters (such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting polypeptides) [23,24]; and (5) lipid deposition: microgravity disrupts the activity of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism in the liver [25,26], leading to increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased oxidation. Additionally, microgravity affects the expression of genes related to lipoprotein synthesis in the liver, reducing the synthesis and secretion of lipoproteins. Long-term Space Composite Stress in Rats (LSCS) can also trigger depression and cognitive impairments in the body in multiple ways. The possible pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive and poorly understood, involving multiple aspects, including the dysregulation of neural plasticity in astronauts’ brains, decreased levels of neurotransmitters, dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, oxidative stress, and abnormal inflammatory responses [27]. Among them, the volume of brain regions, neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus, and antioxidant capacity are greatly affected by spaceflight. These physiological indicators with abnormal changes have become the targets for studying the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments [28,29,30]. Besides other factors such as space radiation, isolation and confinement, and circadian rhythm disorders, increasing evidence suggests that microgravity itself can affect the brain through multiple mechanisms, including vestibular deprivation, weightlessness, and cerebrospinal fluid shift [31]. In addition, gut microbiota, as a research hotspot involved in the regulation of multiple physiological systems of the body in recent years, has also been reported to undergo abnormal changes after spaceflight. Although changes in gut microbiota during spaceflight have attracted the attention of relevant scholars, there are few reports on its role in the process of liver and brain abnormalities in the body after flight. Ground-based studies have found that gut microbiota can interact with the body through pathways such as the liver–gut axis and the brain–gut axis. The key pathway among them refers to the neurohumoral network through which intestinal functions communicate with the liver and brain. This pathway integrates multiple elements such as nerves, hormones, and metabolism [32]. In order to study microgravity effects at different levels, ground-based experiments often need to establish different models, including cell models, Caenorhabditis elegans models, and mouse models. For the mouse model, weight loss and bone loss are extremely important changes, and this characteristic is often used as a sign of the successful simulation of microgravity in ground-based mouse models [33,34]. Traditional ground-based microgravity mouse models mainly simulate microgravity by completely unloading or inducing limb disuse [35]. However, tail suspension still causes certain mechanical injuries to mice, which may have an impact on the simulation results of microgravity [36]. The 3D-Clinostat, independently developed by the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is often used to study the microgravity effects on model plants and the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans. Its principle is to continuously and randomly adjust the experimental samples in the center of the frame in the biaxial direction, averaging the gravity vector close to zero [37]. This study is based on the principle of the 3D-Clinostat causing bone loss in mice to establish a new microgravity model in mice, and explores the effects of microgravity on the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in mice. Combined with the functional prediction of PICRUST 2, behavioral experiments, and a series of physiological and biochemical tests of liver and brain tissues, it has been verified that microgravity changes the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profile, with abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues. Furthermore, through fecal microbiota transplantation technology, we have also explored the important role of the imbalance of gut microbiota in the abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues caused by microgravity.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Materials and Reagents Vancomycin (50 mg/kg), Neomycin (100 mg/kg), Metronidazole (100 mg/kg), Ampicillin (1 mg/mL), and 4% Paraformaldehyde were purchased from Macleans Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Acetonitrile (99.9%), Methanol (99.9%), and Diethyl Ether (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Standard compounds of neurotransmitters Serotonin (5-HT), Norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DOPA), Acetylcholine (ACH), Glutamate (Glu), and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 4.2. Structure and Parameters of the 3D-Clinostat The 3D-Clinostat was purchased from the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The principles and methods for simulating microgravity were referenced from the previous literature and modified based on our team’s experience [84]. The parameters of the 3D-Clinostat are as follows: rotating frames: 2, capable of independent rotation; sample stage: area 400 mm × 300 mm, load capacity 0–3 kg; rotation mode: random; rotation speed: ±0–10 rpm, with speed resolution of 0.1 rpm, and capable of long-term continuous operation (≥30 days). 4.3. Animals Experimental Design C57BL/6 male mice (specific pathogen free, SPF grade, 6 weeks, weighing (20 ± 2)g) and sterilized mouse growth maintenance feed were obtained from Changsheng Biotech (Benxi, China). The brief experimental protocol is as follows. Two batches of mice were sequentially obtained. For the first batch, the mice were randomly divided into two groups (6 mice per group): group 1 (SMG), mice were used to establish a microgravity model and investigate its effects; and group 2 (WT), mice served as a control reference. In the second batch (group 3, FMT), mice underwent fecal microbiota transplantation to replicate the gut microbiota structure of the SMG group, thereby exploring the role of the gut microbiota in microgravity effects. The details are as follows. Mice were housed in a controlled environment at 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle for 1–2 weeks for acclimation, with food and water provided ad libitum. For the establishment of the microgravity simulation model using a 3D-Clinostat, after two weeks of acclimation, the first batch of mice underwent a one-week adaptation training on the clinostat (6 h of rotation on the first day, followed by 18 h of rest; 12 h of rotation for the second and third days, with 12 h of rest; 24 h of rotation on the fourth day, and a rest day on the fifth; and another 24 h of rotation on the sixth day, with a rest day on the seventh). On the eighth day (denoted as Day 1), the mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 6): the 3D-Clinostat group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes (Patent No.: ZL202022855659.9) and the WT group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes only, labeled as SMG (Simulated Microgravity) and WT (Wild Type), respectively. The SMG group underwent a 42-day rotation treatment. During this period, both groups were fed with solid agar and normal growth maintenance feed (with water and food separated inside the survival boxes), and daily weight, water, and food intake were recorded. The water and food were replaced regularly, and the survival boxes were cleaned to ensure a comfortable living environment for the mice. After the 42 days of rotation, fecal samples were collected from both groups. Some samples were directly stored at −80 °C for 16S sequencing after morphological observation, and others were stored with 30% glycerol at −80 °C for subsequent FMT. The learning and memory capabilities of the mice were assessed using the Barnes maze and Y-maze tests. Subsequently, small animal magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan the brains of both groups to observe any differences in brain region volume and morphology between SMG and WT mice. After dissection, bilateral femurs were collected for length and weight measurement. Micro-CT and HE staining were then used to observe the morphology of the mouse femur tissue to confirm the success of the microgravity simulation. Intestinal, liver, serum, and brain samples from both groups were collected for further testing. For the establishment of the pseudo-germ-free mouse model induced by a mixture of antibiotics, we referred to the studies of Hoedt EC, Hueston CM, Cash N, et al. [85]. In brief, six mice after one week of acclimation were intragastrically administered a mixture of vancomycin (50 mg/kg), neomycin (100 mg/kg), and metronidazole (100 mg/kg) every 12 h, with a gavage volume of 10 mL/kg; ampicillin (1 mg/mL) was also added to the drinking water. This intervention was continued, and mouse feces were collected daily for anaerobic culture counts. On the seventh day, we found that the total number of viable bacteria in the feces was less than 1 CFU/mg, indicating the successful establishment of germ-free mice. After the pseudo-germ-free mice underwent the same adaptation training as before, they were housed in 3D-printed mouse survival boxes without simulated microgravity treatment for 42 days. During this period, the feces from the SMG group were used to intragastrically administer the pseudo-germ-free mice twice every seven days. After 42 days, the group was labeled as the FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplantation) group. Feces were collected as before, and the mice’s learning and memory abilities were assessed. The mice were then dissected, and their livers, serum, and brains were collected for subsequent tests. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology (Approval Number: IACUC-2023003, 15 February 2023; IACUC-2024141, 10 December 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 4.4. Micro-CT of Bone Tissue The right femurs of mice fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were scanned using a Micro-CT scanner (Quantum GX2, PerkinElmer, Berlin, Germany) with appropriate scanning parameters. The scanning parameters were set as follows: voltage at 85 kV, current at 200 μA, and exposure time at 384 ms. The images were reconstructed using GPU NRecon Server V1.7.4.2 software. Microstructural analysis of the bone was conducted on a region located 0.5 mm above the growth plate in the metaphysis of the distal femur, with a width of 0.5 mm. This analysis provides insights into the bone’s microarchitecture, which is crucial for understanding the effects of microgravity simulation on bone tissue. 4.5. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment used was a small animal MRI scanner from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. After anesthetizing the mice with 5% isoflurane to stabilize their condition, scans were conducted. A three-dimensional T2-weighted imaging with a rapid acquisition and relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence was employed to acquire structural images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) of 1800 ms, echo time (TE) of 45 ms, a flip angle of 90°, a sampling matrix of 256 × 256, voxel size of 0.078 mm × 0.078 mm × 0.512 mm, 32 slices, and slice thickness/spacing of 0.512/0 mm. The images, originally in DICOM format, were converted to NIFTI format. ITKSNAP 3.6.0 and MATLAB R2022a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) software were utilized to automatically and manually remove the mouse brain scalp. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed using SPM 8.3.2.0 in conjunction with MATLAB software. 4.6. Behavioral Experiments (Barnes Maze and Y-Maze) The Y-maze and Barnes maze are authoritative tests for assessing short-term memory and spatial learning in mice [86,87]. The specific methods are as follows. The Barnes maze consists of a gray-white circular platform (diameter = 122 cm) with 20 holes evenly spaced around the perimeter. One hole (the target hole) is connected to an escape box that is not perceptible to the experimental animal, while the other holes have no such connection. Before the experimental day, each mouse is allowed a 5 min adaptive exploration in the device. During the subsequent 5 days of training, mice are forced to find a hidden box under the stimulation of bright light. The trial ends when the mouse enters the target hole or when the exploration lasts for 5 min. Each mouse’s escape box is positioned in the same location. To eliminate the influence of the previous mouse, the device is wiped with 75% ethanol before starting a new trial. The escape tracks and time (escape latency) were recorded by SuperMaze V2.0 (Shanghai Xinruan Information Technology, Shanghai, China). The Y-maze comprises three arms (35 cm long, 15 cm high, 5 cm wide) that converge at the same angle (120°). The mouse is placed in the center of the maze and allowed to explore spontaneously for 8 min. During the exploration, the total number of arm entries (Nt) and the number of successive entries into different arms in overlapping triplet sets (Na) are recorded. All data are recorded through SuperMaze software (Shanghai Xinruan Information Technology, Shanghai, China). The percentage of spontaneous alternation is calculated using the following formula: spontaneous alternation = (Na/(Nt − 2)) × 100%. 4.7. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining Following the methods of previous studies, intestinal and liver tissues were carefully collected and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) [88,89]. Briefly, after fixing the tissues in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 24 h, they were embedded in paraffin. The tissues were then sectioned into 5 μm slices and stained with HE before being observed under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 4.8. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) Inflammation-related cytokines in colonic tissue, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as the levels of serum ATCH, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), were measured using corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.9. Detection of Lipid Levels, Liver Function, and Antioxidant Capacity in Liver and Brain The serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), as well as the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in both serum and liver, were measured using commercial diagnostic kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, China) according to the instructions. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver and brain tissues were also analyzed with the respective commercial diagnostic kits. 4.10. Detection of Neurotransmitters and Corticosteroids Mouse brain tissue samples (20 mg) were washed with sterile saline. Deionized water (200 μL) and a mixture of acetonitrile–methanol solution (800 μL) were added to the brain tissue samples. The mixture was sonicated at 4 °C, then vortexed and quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen. The mixture was allowed to return to 25 °C, and the process was repeated three times to obtain a homogenate of brain tissue. The contents of representative neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DOPA), acetylcholine (ACH), glutamate (Glu), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain tissue homogenate were detected using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The treatment method and testing conditions were referenced from the literature [90]. The expression levels of cortisol and corticosterone in serum were also measured by LC–MS. Briefly, diethyl ether (500 μL) was added to the serum samples (800 μL) and rotated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the upper organic phase was collected, and the process was repeated once more. The product was dried with nitrogen gas and then dissolved in methanol (200 μL), vortexed for 3 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (100 μL) was used for LC–MS detection. Reference standards for these substances were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA). 4.11. DNA Extraction and 16S rDNA Sequencing Mouse feces were collected between 20:00 and 20:30, quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The detailed methods for DNA extraction from feces and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis are as follows. The total DNA was extracted using the TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primers used for the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rDNA are 343F: 5′-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′ and 798R: 5′-AGGGTATCTAATCCT-3′ (referencing the literature on the design of 16S rRNA gene primers for 454 pyrosequencing of the human foregut microbiome). Extraction and purification of genomic DNA were carried out using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA). The samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the sequencing analysis was performed by Shanghai OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using Usearch (version 7.1). Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were generated using QIIME2 (2018.11) in combination with the R-package vegan (version 3.5.3). Differential abundance analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 4.12. Serum Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis Serum metabolites were extracted using a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (2/1, v/v) by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered and used for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. A Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS UHPLC system coupled with a Q-Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiling in both positive and negative ESI modes. An ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) was employed for both positive and negative modes. Metabolites were identified using Progenesis QI 2.0 (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases such as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and LIPID MAPS, as well as self-built databases. Principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling’s T2 region, depicted as an ellipse in the score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) assesses the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, with variables having VIP > 1 considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, a default 7-round cross-validation was applied, excluding 1/seventh of the samples from the mathematical model in each round to prevent overfitting. The positive and negative data were combined to obtain a comprehensive dataset. Differential metabolites were selected based on a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values from the OPLS-DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student’s t-test on the normalized peak areas. Metabolites with VIP values > 1.0 and p values < 0.05 were considered differential metabolites. Metabolite classification and functional analysis were completed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and the KEGG database. 4.13. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences between groups for 16S data were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while metabolic profiling data and physiological parameter data were evaluated using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Establishment of Microgravity Mouse Model Based on 3D-Clinostat We established a microgravity animal model for C57BL/6 mice using a 3D-Clinostat (Figure 1a), with Video S1 showing the operation of the clinostat and Figure S1a demonstrating the design drawing of the mouse survival box. During the 42-day experimental period, we measured the daily food and water intake of the mice in both groups and found that the rotation treatment did not affect the mice’s consumption of food and water (Figure 1b). To evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity on the growth and development of mice, we monitored their body weight throughout the treatment period. We observed that compared to the wild type (WT) group, the body weight of mice in the simulated microgravity (SMG) group showed a declining trend from Day 0 to Day 7, then gradually returned to normal growth, and stabilized after Day 21 (Figure S1b). Statistical analysis of the body weight differences between the two groups on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 revealed that the body weight of the SMG group was significantly lower than that of the WT group on Days 7, 14, and 21 (Figure 1b). This suggests that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have caused damage to the mice, leading to a decrease in body weight. Although the mice gradually adapted and returned to normal growth after Day 7, there was still a difference compared to the WT group. Furthermore, on Day 42, we performed autopsies on the mice and analyzed their main organ indices, finding no significant change in the heart index but a significant decrease in the liver, spleen, and thymus indices, indicating that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have affected the mice’s digestive and immune systems (Figure 1b).

(d) Microstructure parameters of mouse femurs after 42 days of microgravity treatment, including BV/TV (bone volume fraction), Tb. Th (trabecular thickness), Tb. N (trabecular number), Ct.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group.To determine whether the damage caused by the 3D-Clinostat treatment was due to simulated microgravity, we investigated the osteoporosis condition of the mice’s hindlimb femurs. Osteoporosis is a characteristic effect of the body under microgravity stress, and therefore, changes in femur-related indices can be used as a basis for judging the effectiveness of the microgravity simulation [38,39]. First, we examined the femur index, femur length, and femur diameter of the mice’s hindlimb right femur and found no significant differences after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat (Figure S2). Then, we used Micro-CT and HE staining to assess the morphological structure of the mouse femur. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse femur from Micro-CT images showed that the number of trabeculae in the femur tissue was significantly reduced after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, with sparse arrangement and even fractures, wider trabecular spacing, and increased separation (Figure 1c). HE staining for the morphological examination of the bone tissue of the right hindlimb femur revealed that in the WT group, the trabeculae were clear, evenly distributed, neatly arranged, with a larger thickness and smaller spacing, closely linked, and the marrow cavity was clear with a relatively intact structure (Figure 1c). In contrast, the model group mice showed significantly thinner and narrower trabeculae, with increased spacing, loose and incomplete arrangement, and areas of trabecular loss. Furthermore, we measured the microstructural parameters of the cancellous bone and found that after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, the BV/TV (bone volume fraction), Tb. N (trabecular number), Tb. Th (trabecular thickness), and Ct. Th (cortical thickness) were significantly decreased, while the Tb. Sp (trabecular separation) and trabecular bone pattern factor significantly increased (Figure 1d). These findings collectively indicate that the mice’s femurs exhibited a significant state of osteoporosis, suggesting the successful establishment of the microgravity mouse model. 2.2. Microgravity-Induced Imbalance in Mouse Gut Microbiota Microgravity, as an environmental stressor in spaceflight, induces physiological changes including alterations in the intestinal tissue and gut microbiota [40]. Through HE staining of colonic tissue, we observed that simulated microgravity (SMG) caused damage to the colonic lumen, characterized by thinning of the epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced crypt damage (Figure 2a). We also observed that the feces of the SMG-treated mice were softer and more yellowish, whereas those of the WT group were normal, dark brown, and granular, with a moderate texture (Figure 2b). The differences in fecal status indicated gastrointestinal dysfunction and poor food digestion and absorption in the SMG-treated mice. Concurrent with the colonic tissue damage, we found a significant increase in the secretion of intestinal cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in SMG-treated mice (Figure 2c). Changes in the intestinal physiological environment led to alterations in the gut microbiota. To investigate whether microgravity restructured the mouse gut microbiota, we analyzed and compared the diversity differences between SMG and WT groups, including α-diversity and β-diversity indices. Among the α-diversity indices, the Shannon and Simpson indices decreased in the SMG group compared to the WT group (p < 0.05) (Figure 2d,e). Analysis methods for β-diversity, including unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA, Figure 2f), Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2g), and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA, Figure 2h), were employed to study the similarities or differences in sample community composition. We found that samples from the SMG group clustered together, distinct from those of the WT group, regardless of the β-diversity analysis method used. Additionally, by statistically analyzing the number of significantly different microorganisms at various taxonomic levels between SMG and WT groups (Figure 2i), we identified 6 significantly different phyla (Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and Deferribacteres, Figure S3a), 7 significantly different classes, including Bacilli, Acidobacteria, Deferribacteres, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (Figure S3b), as well as 7 significantly different orders (Figure S3c), 15 significantly different families (Figure S3d), and 26 significantly different genera (Figure S3e).

(i) Display of the number of microorganisms with significant differences at each taxonomic level. The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 versus WT group. 2.3. Microgravity-Induced Dysbiosis Leads to Metabolic Imbalance in Liver and Brain The composition of the mouse gut microbiota is closely related to its function, and local intestinal functional changes may affect the host’s physiology [41]. To explore the functional characteristics of the gut microbiota after microgravity restructuring, we focused on the KEGG predictions involving cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, and metabolism. We found that the functional differences in the gut microbiota were mainly enriched in 49 related pathways of metabolic functions and 14 related pathways of organismal system functions (Figure 3a). To more intuitively discover the significance of the altered metabolic pathways, we focused on the changed pathway enrichment in the metabolism and organismal systems at KEGG level 2. The study found that secondary pathways related to metabolic functions mainly involved lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (Figure 3b). Those related to organismal system functions primarily concerned digestive system metabolism, the nervous system, and the endocrine system (Figure 3c). Furthermore, tertiary pathways involved in lipid metabolism included glycerolipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation (Figure 3d). Tertiary pathways related to the digestive system included mineral absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, and salivary secretion (Figure 3e). Pathways involved in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites included tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, carbapenem biosynthesis, and phenazine biosynthesis (Figure 3f). Pathways related to the nervous and endocrine systems included the glucagon signaling pathway, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, estrogen signaling pathway, and prolactin signaling pathway (Figure 3g). These results suggest that microgravity restructured the composition and function of the gut microbiota, causing damage to the host’s lipid metabolic functions and the health of the digestive system, including the gut and liver, as well as the nervous and endocrine systems involving the brain.

Replicability of Gut Microbiota in Mice Under Microgravity To further explore the replicability of gut microbiota, we used the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) technique to intragastrically administer the fecal suspension of mice in the SMG group to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and this group was marked as FMT. The intestinal contents of this group were analyzed by 16S sequencing, and the microbiota structure was compared with those of the WT and SMG groups. We found that the α diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index) of the gut microbiota in the WT group mice was significantly different from that in the SMG group and the FMT group (Figure 4a,b). For β-diversity, it can also be seen from UPGMA (Figure 4c), PCA (Figure 4d), and PCoA (Figure 4e) that the WT group was significantly independent in spatial distance from the other two groups, while the gut microbiota diversity of the SMG group and the FMT group showed a highly overlapping state. By analyzing the microbiota structure among the three groups using Circos software (version 0.69-9), it was also found that the gut microbiota in the SMG and FMT groups were very similar in composition structure and were clearly distinguishable from the WT group (Figure 4f). Comparing the differences in the top 15 gut microbiota with relative abundances in mice under the three different treatment methods at the phylum, class, and order levels (Figure 4g–i), similar results were obtained. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of gut microbiota characteristics among FMT, SMG, and WT group mice. (a,b) Differences in α diversity: Shannon index (a) and Simpson index.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, ** p < 0.01. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance.In addition, we counted the total number of microorganisms with significant differences at each taxonomic level between FMT and WT and identified 6 phyla, 7 classes, 8 orders, 16 families, and 38 genera with significant differences (Figure 5a). This was close to the number of microorganisms with significant differences obtained at each taxonomic level between SMG and WT. Furthermore, to analyze the gut microbiota related to the microgravity effect, we screened the common differential microbiota at each taxonomic level between the WT group and the SMG group as well as between the WT group and the FMT group. It was found that there were 5, 6, 6, 10, and 23 common differential bacteria at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels, respectively (Figure 5b–f). In Figure S4a–e, we showed the specific up-regulation and down-regulation trends of the common differential bacteria in the SMG and FMT groups compared with the WT group. We found that the up-regulation and down-regulation trends of each genus were consistent in the SMG group and the FMT group. These common differential genera between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT may play an important role in the response of gut microbiota to microgravity stress. The above results indicate that FMT can reproduce the characteristics of gut microbiota under microgravity well, whether in terms of microbiota diversity, structure, differences at each taxonomic level, or up-regulation and down-regulation trends.

Microgravity Induces an Imbalance of Serum Metabolites in the Body Changes in the gut microbiota are closely related to nutrient absorption and metabolism, which can lead to alterations in a multitude of endogenous small molecule metabolites in the serum, including highly polar amino acids, glucose, nucleosides, as well as less polar lipids and sterols [42]. Monitoring these fluctuations in serum metabolites can provide insights into the biochemical activities within an organism, thereby assessing the stress response and health status under specific environmental conditions. To explore the reconstructive effects of microgravity on mouse serum metabolites, we employed LC–MS technology to analyze the metabolic profiles of the mice’s serum. To distinguish the differences in serum metabolites among the three groups, orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted. All sample data points fell within the 95% confidence interval (CI). R2X and R2Y were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model construction, while Q2 reflected the predictive power of the model. The OPLS-DA model revealed distinct metabolic profiles among the three groups in both the ESI positive ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.692, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.803; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.536, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.765, Figure 6a–e) and the negative ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.625, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.929; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.562, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.911, Figure 6f–j).

(i,j) The 200 replacement tests for SMG versus WT group and FMT versus WT group in the negative source model (n = 6).Similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity, we observed that the serum metabolite profiles of the SMG group and the FMT group were essentially overlapping, while being significantly separated from the WT group. The similar microbial community characteristics and serum metabolic profiles between the SMG and FMT groups suggest that microgravity may alter the serum metabolic spectrum by restructuring the gut microbiota of the mice. This finding implies that the changes in the gut microbiota under microgravity conditions could be a key factor in the metabolic shifts observed in the serum, potentially leading to a better understanding of the physiological impacts of microgravity on the organism. 2.6. Microgravity-Induced Disruption of Serum Metabolites by the Gut Microbiota Leading to Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders To explore the impact of microgravity-altered metabolic profiles on the organism, we further analyzed the significantly different metabolites (SDMs) and their functions. Based on the variable importance projection (VIP) being greater than 1 and a p-value less than 0.05, we identified 27 differentially upregulated metabolites and 68 differentially downregulated metabolites in the SMG group compared to the WT group. Similarly, 32 metabolites were increased, while 42 were decreased in the FMT group compared to the WT group (Figure 7a). To uncover the metabolites closely associated with the gut microbiota, we found 61 core SDMs that appeared in both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT (Figure 7b,c). Using MetaboAnalyst 6.0, we classified these 61 core SDMs, with 56 being attributed to their respective subcategories. The top five categories of compounds by the number of SDMs were fatty acids and conjugates, accounting for 23.21% of the total, with 13 metabolites; amino acids, peptides, and analogs, representing 19.64%, with 11 metabolites; and fatty acid esters, making up 5.36%, with 3 metabolites (Figure 7d). This suggests that both the SMG and FMT groups exhibited evident disruptions in lipid and amino acid metabolism compared to the WT group. Figure 7.

(i) Analysis of pathways jointly regulated by differential metabolites between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance.To investigate the health effects of the metabolic disorders induced by microgravity, we performed KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the SMG group compared to the WT group. The top 20 pathways affected were primarily involved in metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In terms of metabolism, 25 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, 7 in amino acid metabolism, and 5 in nucleotide metabolism. Regarding organismal systems, eight SDMs impacted the digestive system, and five affected the endocrine system. For environmental information processing, nine SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and three in signal transduction (Figure 7e). Similarly, we conducted KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the FMT group compared to the WT group, revealing that the top 20 pathways were also related to metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In metabolism, 18 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, and 16 in amino acid metabolism. For organismal systems, 14 SDMs impacted the digestive system. In environmental information processing, 10 SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and 4 in signal transduction (Figure 7f). Furthermore, to explore the role of the gut microbiota in the physiological disorders induced by microgravity, we analyzed the common metabolic pathways involved by the SDMs (differential metabolites) of both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, identifying 48 pathways (Figure 7g). Consistent with the predicted functional impacts of gut microbiota under microgravity, the shared metabolic pathways included lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism in metabolism; the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems; and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing (Figure 7h). Tables S1 and S2 list the shared pathways for SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT, respectively. Additionally, we compared the 48 metabolic pathways involving 42 common SDMs between the SMG and FMT groups with those identified in the SMG and FMT groups, finding 42 shared pathways (Figure 7i, Table S3). Interestingly, these pathways were primarily involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism in metabolism, the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems, and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing. This suggests that the imbalance of the gut microbiota under microgravity may lead to host lipid and neuroendocrine disorders, with the 61 common SDMs potentially playing a crucial role in these physiological responses. To elucidate the role of these 61 common differential metabolites in the main physiological effects induced by microgravity, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, digestive system, nervous system, endocrine system, membrane transport, and signal transduction, we performed technical analysis of their involvement in the metabolic pathways of interest. We found that several common differential metabolites (e.g., L-Glutamine, L-Leucine, Dodecanoic acid, etc.) were involved in the primary physiological effects triggered by microgravity (Table S4). Based on these results, we hypothesize that the imbalance of the gut microbiota induced by microgravity may lead to significant changes in key serum metabolites, which in turn could cause hepatic and cerebral metabolic disorders. 2.7. Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders Induced by Microgravity The findings from gut microbiota and serum metabolomics suggest that microgravity may cause an imbalance in the gut microbiota, leading to disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolism, and potentially inducing functional damage to the digestive and endocrine systems. The liver, being the primary organ involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism within the digestive system, and the brain, as the central control hub of the nervous and endocrine systems, are of particular interest [43,44]. To verify the hypothesis that microgravity-induced restructuring of the gut microbiota could lead to metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, we examined the morphological structure of the liver and brain in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups of mice using HE staining and magnetic resonance imaging. In the pathological sections of mouse liver tissue and quantification the vesicular steatosis, we observed micro/macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver), inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, more vacuole, and higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole in the SMG group (Figure 8a and Figure S5). The FMT group showed minor fatty degeneration, inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, medium vacuole, and less higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the brain revealed that the volumes of various brain regions, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, were expanded in the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, although not significantly (Figure 8b,c). Furthermore, we assessed potential brain functional abnormalities using the Barnes maze and Y-maze. The Barnes maze was used to evaluate spatial memory in mice [45]. As shown in Figure 8d, we categorized the paths of mice from all groups during the Barnes maze experiment (including the four days of training) into five characteristics. We observed that the distribution of latency times for mice in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups increased in the 90–120 s range, while those in the 0–30 s range decreased (Figure 8f). Scoring revealed that the SMG group had lower scores than the FMT, which in turn was lower than the WT (Table S5). Additionally, a daily analysis of latency times during the Barnes maze experiment (Figure 8e) showed no significant differences in latency among the three groups during the first two days. However, on the third day, the SMG group’s time to find the goal hole was significantly longer than that of the WT group (p < 0.05), with no significant difference between the FMT and WT groups. From the fourth to the fifth day, the escape latency of both the SMG and FMT groups was significantly higher than that of the WT group. Figure 8.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group.The Y-maze was used to assess the working memory differences among the SMG, FMT, and WT groups. We found that the SMG group had significantly fewer spontaneous alternations compared to the WT group, indicating memory loss (p < 0.001), and the FMT group showed a similar trend (p < 0.05), suggesting that the gut microbiota may be involved in the cognitive dysfunction induced by microgravity (Figure 8g). Subsequently, we also examined the antioxidant capacity and neurotransmitter levels in the brain tissue of the SMG, FMT, and WT groups and found that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE levels in the brain tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA and GABA levels were significantly lower (Figure 9b,e). The antioxidant capacity data in liver tissue also indicated that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels in the liver tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA, ALT, and AST showed opposite results (Figure 9a,c,d). Serum tests also revealed that the levels of AST, ALT, TC, TG, and LDL in the WT group were significantly lower than in the other two groups, with HDL being significantly higher (Figure 10a). Additionally, the levels of cortisol and ACTH (cortisol and adrenocortic hormone) in serum were on average lower in the other two groups. Notably, the level of corticosterone, although not significantly elevated in the FMT group as with microgravity treatment, still showed a certain increase, suggesting neuroendocrine disorders in the SMG and FMT groups (Figure 10b). These results collectively suggest that microgravity may induce metabolic disorders in the liver and brain through the imbalance of the gut microbiota, leading to oxidative stress and further promoting structural or functional damage to the liver and brain.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion The complex environment of space, including strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures and microgravity, can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [46,47]. During medium- and long-term spaceflight, abnormal changes in multiple systems such as the liver and brain of astronauts, as well as in the neuro–endocrine–immune regulatory network, are the key and difficult points in spaceflight-related research. Although increasing evidence suggests that microgravity is involved in the abnormal changes in the liver and brain after spaceflight, the specific pathways through which it induces these abnormalities remain unclear. Establishing appropriate models is very important for solving this problem. To avoid the impact of unnecessary mechanical injuries on the results, in this study, we established a microgravity model of mice using the 3D-Clinostat and confirmed the feasibility of the new model through the commonly used evaluation methods of previous ground-based models. During the establishment of the new model, the daily food and water intake, which did not show significant changes, indicated that the physiological state of the mice was affected by environmental stress rather than diet. This environmental stress effect was very similar to the stress effect under real microgravity, suggesting that to some extent it was worthy of being a choice for ground-based simulation experiments. Obvious stress effects, such as weight loss, decreased organ indices, and bone loss, are common clinical manifestations of the microgravity effects in the head-down bed rest experiment (for humans) and the tail suspension experiment (for mice) [48,49,50]. Furthermore, we separately explored the impact of microgravity, one of the space environmental factors, on the liver and brain tissues of mice. The serum metabolome results, serving as macroscopic manifestations and preliminary diagnostic bases for the body’s condition, revealed obvious disorders in lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as abnormalities in the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in the model group mice compared to the WT group. The excessively high levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), TC (total cholesterol), TG (triglyceride), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and the overly low level of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) in the serum confirmed that the model group mice had clinical symptoms of disorders in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Similar to our results, increases in the levels of AST and ALT were also observed in the ground-based experiments on tail-suspended rats for 2 months and 42 days [21,51]. Likewise, during missions on the International Space Station, increases in TC, TG, and LDL in human serum were also observed, along with a decrease in the HDL level [16]. It can be seen that spaceflight has a serious impact on the body’s lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and our results also prove that the single factor of microgravity also promotes such metabolic disorders, which may cause varying degrees of harm to the body’s systems. Metabolic disorders and abnormalities in the digestive system are closely related to the liver. In this study, the livers of the model group mice showed diffuse microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as abnormalities in antioxidant indicators such as T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase). These changes also frequently appeared in previous studies. Japanese quails that stayed on the Mir orbital station for five days showed a large number of lipid droplet depositions in almost all liver cells of all the flight chicks, and the total amount of lipid droplets was nearly five times higher than that of the ground control chicks [52]. Meanwhile, the accumulation of lipids in the liver led to the consumption of adipocytes in the bone marrow of these flight chicks. Abnormal lipid accumulation was also observed in the livers of all spaceflight mice as measured by Oil Red O staining [53]. In multiple spaceflight missions involving mice and rats, the liver system also exhibited varying degrees of lipid deposition, degeneration, and inflammatory damage [20,53]. In the ground-based experiment on 42-day head-down bed rest (HDBR) monkeys, compared with the WT group, the HDBR group monkeys also showed slight liver damage, with fatty vacuoles and inflammatory cell aggregation appearing in the liver [54]. The above results indicate that both spaceflight and the single factor of microgravity can lead to liver dysfunction, cause changes in lipid metabolism, and induce clinical features similar to those of early non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Besides abnormal liver metabolism and function, we also found abnormalities in the nervous system and endocrine system of the model group mice, which are directly related to the brain. In this study, the brain region structures of the model group mice, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, did not show significant changes. However, the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues (T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA) decreased. In the ground-based experiment of hindlimb suspension (HLS), the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the model group rats were significantly lower than those of the WT group [55]. Corresponding to the abnormal antioxidant function of the brain, the brain function of the model group mice was also affected, and their spatial memory and working memory were damaged to varying degrees. The memory ability of mice is closely related to the secretion of various neurotransmitters, especially Glu, ACH, 5-HT, DOPA, and NE. The impairment of memory ability may indicate that Glu is an amino acid neurotransmitter. It is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Moreover, Glu plays an important role in learning and memory, neuronal plasticity, and brain development [56,57]. ACH is a cholinergic neurotransmitter. They play an important role in regulating attention, enhancing learning and memory ability, and processing sensory information [58,59]. 5-HT, DA, and NE are monoamine neurotransmitters that can enhance the excitability of the brain and the ability of learning and memory [60,61,62,63]. 5-HT plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, and its receptor 5-HT1A regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton through the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, inducing neurogenesis and synapse formation [64]. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter. The reduction in dopamine content in the brain can lead to the loss, degeneration, or death of neurons, further impairing learning and memory [65,66]. NE has a very wide range of functions in the brain and is involved in the regulation of almost all brain functions, including learning and memory, attention, consciousness, alertness, and emotion. As expected, in our study, the secretion of several important neurotransmitters (Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE) was abnormal, which might be the cause of the brain memory dysfunction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the physiological disorders and pathological development of diseases in organisms are closely related to gut microbiota. Hundreds to thousands of kinds of bacteria colonize in the human intestine, and their quantity is so large that it far exceeds the number of human cells [67]. Gut microbiota mainly colonize in intestinal mucus, the intestinal lumen, and feces, and the number of genes they carry is more than 100 times that of human genes [68]. The changes in human physiological functions are closely associated with the intestinal microbial community. The mutually beneficial intestinal microbial ecology is of great importance for the homeostasis of metabolism and the liver–brain system [69,70]. Intestinal microorganisms play a role in metabolic regulation, intestinal peristalsis and barrier homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and neural signal transduction [71]. The relationship between the host and microorganisms is complex, and when an imbalance occurs, it may lead to abnormalities in the body’s systems. We have found that compared with the control group, the model group and the fecal microbiota transplantation group of mice exhibited gut physiological abnormalities (intestinal structure and tissue cytokines), fecal abnormalities, and gut microbiota imbalance under conditions of liver–brain metabolic disorders and functional abnormalities. The damage and inflammatory response in the colonic tissue of the SMG group mice suggest the disruption of the intestinal barrier and an abnormal physiological environment. This may directly affect the stability of the gut microbiota [72]. The group’s yellowish and soft feces further confirm this point [73]. Furthermore, we have discussed the common differential gut microbiota of the model group mice and the FMT group mice relative to the WT group. It was found that the imbalanced gut microbiota was found to be related to liver–brain abnormalities in functional prediction. This may be because microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota, thus inducing liver–brain abnormalities. Studies suggest that microgravity stress can change the physiological environment of the intestine and also have an impact on the virulence of intestinal bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics. Microgravity, low fluid shear, and microgravity-related dynamics have been proved to play a role in microbial gene expression, physiology, and pathogenesis [74]. Important intestinal bacterial metabolites such as valeric acid, indole-3-propionic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol play significant roles in the metabolism and functions of the intestine, liver, and brain. To explore how gut microbiota affects liver–brain abnormalities, we discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and significantly changed differential metabolites and analyzed the connection between typical differential metabolites and liver–brain abnormalities. The research results showed that the significantly decreased oleic acid is related to liver tissue health and lipid metabolism. 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; valeric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; adrenic acid is related to the secretion of neurotransmitters; L-glutamine is related to amino acid metabolism; and L-leucine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. N(6)-Methyllysine is related to the brain and neurotransmitters. N-acetylglutamine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Glycyl-arginine is related to the brain, and m-chlorohippuric acid is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole-3-propionic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Ketoleucine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Equol is a metabolite of gut microbiota. As for the significantly increased ones, D-pipecolic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is related to the liver–brain system and amino acid metabolism. Salicylic acid is related to the liver. 3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. 3-Methoxy-4-Hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate is related to the brain and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE). In order to explore the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress, this study used MetaMapp (version 2.0.1 45) to analyze the interactions between different metabolites and screen for key metabolites in the stress response of mice induced by microgravity at the metabolic level. MetaMapp is a tool for metabolomics data analysis and visualization. Its main function is to construct a network map of metabolites by integrating chemical similarity and mass spectral similarity matrices, as well as the KEGG reaction database [75]. It helps researchers map metabolomics data to biochemical modules, aiding biological interpretation. The network maps generated by MetaMapp clearly show the relationships and interactions among metabolites, which is very helpful for understanding complex metabolic networks. Moreover, MetaMapp does not rely on genomic information, allowing it to independently map and visualize metabolites. This makes it suitable for studying organisms without complete genomic information. As shown in Figure S6, under the influence of microgravity, the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism formed a large metabolic network. L-Leucine and ketoleucine were the key node metabolites connecting the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. Specifically, L-Leucine linked amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism through N(6)-Methyllysine and L-Glutamine, while ketoleucine connected lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism through valeric acid. In addition, among the 61 common differential metabolites, we identified a series of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, including 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, aleric acid, D-Pipecolic acid, Indole-3-propionic acid, alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid, 3-Hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol. We hypothesized that these 12 metabolites play an important indicative role in revealing the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and the apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress. Furthermore, to briefly verify this hypothesis, we conducted Pearson correlation analyses among these 12 differential metabolites, differential metabolic bacterial genera, and significantly changed the physiological indicators of the liver and brain. The results showed a strong correlation in general (Figure S7). Given that valeric acid is in a key position in the lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism network under microgravity stress and is also an important metabolite of the gut microbiota, connecting the differential bacterial genera, we speculate that microgravity stress causes the relevant bacterial genera to respond, leading to changes in the content of this compound in the intestine. This compound is absorbed into the blood through the intestine, causing changes in its content in the blood. Such changes, via the nodes, trigger abnormalities in metabolites related to neurotransmitter secretion and lipid metabolism in the amino acid metabolism or lipid metabolism network, further inducing metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. However, this speculation still requires further experimental verification. Finally, it is important to note that in our results, the FMT group did replicate some of the differences between the SMG and WT groups to a certain extent. However, there are still some differences between the FMT and WT groups, and even greater differences between the SMG and WT groups. This suggests that SMG treatment causes metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, which may involve gut microbiota imbalance, but also other mechanisms, including the following. (1) Impaired intestinal barrier function. Microgravity increases gut permeability, allowing bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation [76,77]. The liver is particularly susceptible to this inflammation as it filters blood from the gut. Increased inflammation can impair liver function and lead to metabolic disorders. Tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells are crucial for maintaining gut barrier integrity, and microgravity may disrupt these junctions, further increasing gut permeability. This can lead to the translocation of bacteria and their products to the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [78]. (2) Inflammatory response. Microgravity can activate immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [79]. These cytokines can reach the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and impairing their functions [80]. Additionally, the chronic low-grade inflammation induced by microgravity can have a sustained negative impact on liver–brain metabolism. It can cause insulin resistance, fat accumulation, and oxidative stress, all of which promote the development of metabolic disorders. (3) Bile acid metabolism changes. Microgravity can affect bile acid synthesis in the liver [34,54]. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion and absorption, and changes in their synthesis can lead to alterations in lipid metabolism, negatively affecting liver function and promoting the development of fatty liver disease. Bile acids also play a role in regulating signaling pathways related to liver–brain metabolism, and microgravity may disrupt these pathways, leading to metabolic dysfunction [81]. (4) Psychological factors. Microgravity can cause psychological stress and anxiety in astronauts [82]. These factors can negatively affect liver–brain metabolism [83]. Stress can lead to the release of stress hormones (such as cortisol), which can impair liver function and cause metabolic disorders. Anxiety can also affect brain function and lead to cognitive dysfunction.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Overall, in this study, the 3D-Clinostat was used to conduct ground simulation of the microgravity effect on mice. It was found that the number of trabeculae in the femoral tissues of mice was significantly reduced and osteoporosis was evident. The obvious osteoporotic state of the mouse femur indicated the successful establishment of the mouse microgravity model. Subsequently, based on the 16S data detection of the feces of the model group mice, it was discovered that microgravity reconstructed the gut microbiota of mice. Based on the functional enrichment analysis of the microbiota, it was found that microgravity might impair the functions of lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of the body as well as the health of systems including the intestine, liver, and brain. Then, through fecal microbiota transplantation, it was found that the serum metabolism of the model group and the FMT group was significantly different from that of the WT group, which was similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity data. Thus, the gut microbiota dependence of microgravity-induced metabolic disorders was determined, indicating that microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota. Based on the functional analysis of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of mice, we supposed that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to abnormal metabolism in the liver and brain tissues of the body. Finally, based on the serum metabolome data, the oxidation indicators of the brain and liver tissues and serum of the model group mice, as well as the detection of behavioral memory ability and neurotransmitters, it was verified that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to metabolic imbalance and functional abnormalities in the liver and brain tissues of the body. This study offers some references and potential directions for addressing astronauts’ health issues and designing life-support systems in space exploration. It also has practical application value for deepening the understanding of how living organisms adapt to the space environment. However, the data and conclusions obtained from the experiments still need to be verified by more real spaceflight missions. Meanwhile, this study has many deficiencies. For example, a veterinarian should conduct more comprehensive checks on the mice during the experiment to more accurately compare the health status differences among different groups. It is still unclear whether there is a direct association between the liver and brain tissue abnormalities induced by microgravity, and which gut bacteria are the key factors in this abnormality induced by microgravity. All of these require further research, exploration, and verification by researchers around the world.",

Copyright notice ID: 11988970 PMID: 40243802 Abstract Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment. Keywords: microgravity, gut microbiota, metabolic dysfunction, liver, brain, 3D-Clinostat1. Introduction The space environment is extremely complex, characterized by strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity, as well as other environmental factors [1,2]. These factors are collectively referred to as space composite stress, which can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [3,4]. Microgravity, in particular, is a significant factor affecting the health of astronauts aboard a spacecraft and has therefore received considerable attention from researchers [5]. This is primarily because weightlessness not only leads to the redistribution of body fluids towards the head but also deprives the human body of gravitational load. Prolonged stays in space can increase the risks of decreased cardiovascular capacity, impaired immune system, reduced bone density, neurological disorders, and muscle atrophy [6,7,8]. When a spacecraft carrying astronauts rotates around the Earth, the interior is theoretically a zero-gravity environment. However, due to the influence of residual atmospheric drag and the spacecraft’s rotation, the interior actually exhibits a microgravity environment [9]. Nevertheless, true space flight experiments are rarely conducted due to their scarcity of opportunities, high costs, and operational complexity. As a result, most research on the effects of microgravity on the human body is conducted through ground-based simulation experiments, with actual flight tests providing supplementary validation [10]. Ground-based simulation studies of microgravity effects can provide referable data and experimental methods for actual space flight experiments. These simulations are crucial for understanding the physiological impacts of microgravity and developing countermeasures to protect astronaut health during space missions. Exploring the role of microgravity in the damage caused by space composite stress has become an important topic in ground-based experiments in recent years [11,12]. Various damages or abnormalities caused by microgravity in the body are collectively referred to as microgravity effects. The microgravity effects are mainly manifested as changes in multiple physiological systems such as the cardiovascular, liver, bone, muscle, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [13,14,15]. In recent years, researchers have conducted studies on multiple physiological systems related to microgravity, either independently or focusing on some of their interactive effects. However, these studies mainly concentrate on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, while there are relatively few studies on the liver–brain system, especially on its mechanisms. The liver, as the largest internal organ involved in detoxification and metabolism to maintain the body’s homeostasis, experiences significant gravitational changes. Comparisons between flight specimens and ground controls have shown that among ten types of mouse tissues including muscle, eyes, and kidneys, the liver has the largest number of differentially expressed genes and proteins [16]. As an important detoxification organ for preventing physical injuries caused by space risks, the liver also has a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs taken during spaceflight [17,18]. In addition, microgravity exposure can lead to liver dysfunction, resulting in liver injuries and inflammation related to apoptosis and oxidative stress, impaired metabolism, changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism, and lipid deposition [14]. Obviously, these dysfunctions are related to changes in liver metabolism or morphological structure caused by microgravity. Specifically, the major pathophysiological steps involved in these processes are summarized as follows: (1) apoptosis and oxidative stress: microgravity can disrupt the intracellular redox balance, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [19,20]. Excessive ROS can attack biomacromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA within liver cells, causing oxidative damage. Microgravity also activates apoptotic signaling pathways in liver cells, such as the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, microgravity induces changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing cytochrome c to be released into the cytoplasm. This activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3, triggering cell apoptosis; (2) inflammatory response: microgravity can induce or exacerbate liver injury by stimulating the release of inflammatory factors and the infiltration of inflammatory cells [21]; (3) metabolic impairment: microgravity affects pathways or enzymes related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein metabolism [22], leading to metabolic abnormalities of glucose, lipids, and proteins; (4) changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism: microgravity can influence the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (such as the CYP450 enzyme system) in the liver, as well as alter the expression levels of drug transporters (such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting polypeptides) [23,24]; and (5) lipid deposition: microgravity disrupts the activity of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism in the liver [25,26], leading to increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased oxidation. Additionally, microgravity affects the expression of genes related to lipoprotein synthesis in the liver, reducing the synthesis and secretion of lipoproteins. Long-term Space Composite Stress in Rats (LSCS) can also trigger depression and cognitive impairments in the body in multiple ways. The possible pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive and poorly understood, involving multiple aspects, including the dysregulation of neural plasticity in astronauts’ brains, decreased levels of neurotransmitters, dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, oxidative stress, and abnormal inflammatory responses [27]. Among them, the volume of brain regions, neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus, and antioxidant capacity are greatly affected by spaceflight. These physiological indicators with abnormal changes have become the targets for studying the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments [28,29,30]. Besides other factors such as space radiation, isolation and confinement, and circadian rhythm disorders, increasing evidence suggests that microgravity itself can affect the brain through multiple mechanisms, including vestibular deprivation, weightlessness, and cerebrospinal fluid shift [31]. In addition, gut microbiota, as a research hotspot involved in the regulation of multiple physiological systems of the body in recent years, has also been reported to undergo abnormal changes after spaceflight. Although changes in gut microbiota during spaceflight have attracted the attention of relevant scholars, there are few reports on its role in the process of liver and brain abnormalities in the body after flight. Ground-based studies have found that gut microbiota can interact with the body through pathways such as the liver–gut axis and the brain–gut axis. The key pathway among them refers to the neurohumoral network through which intestinal functions communicate with the liver and brain. This pathway integrates multiple elements such as nerves, hormones, and metabolism [32]. In order to study microgravity effects at different levels, ground-based experiments often need to establish different models, including cell models, Caenorhabditis elegans models, and mouse models. For the mouse model, weight loss and bone loss are extremely important changes, and this characteristic is often used as a sign of the successful simulation of microgravity in ground-based mouse models [33,34]. Traditional ground-based microgravity mouse models mainly simulate microgravity by completely unloading or inducing limb disuse [35]. However, tail suspension still causes certain mechanical injuries to mice, which may have an impact on the simulation results of microgravity [36]. The 3D-Clinostat, independently developed by the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is often used to study the microgravity effects on model plants and the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans. Its principle is to continuously and randomly adjust the experimental samples in the center of the frame in the biaxial direction, averaging the gravity vector close to zero [37]. This study is based on the principle of the 3D-Clinostat causing bone loss in mice to establish a new microgravity model in mice, and explores the effects of microgravity on the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in mice. Combined with the functional prediction of PICRUST 2, behavioral experiments, and a series of physiological and biochemical tests of liver and brain tissues, it has been verified that microgravity changes the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profile, with abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues. Furthermore, through fecal microbiota transplantation technology, we have also explored the important role of the imbalance of gut microbiota in the abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues caused by microgravity.2. Results 2.1. Establishment of Microgravity Mouse Model Based on 3D-Clinostat We established a microgravity animal model for C57BL/6 mice using a 3D-Clinostat (Figure 1a), with Video S1 showing the operation of the clinostat and Figure S1a demonstrating the design drawing of the mouse survival box. During the 42-day experimental period, we measured the daily food and water intake of the mice in both groups and found that the rotation treatment did not affect the mice’s consumption of food and water (Figure 1b). To evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity on the growth and development of mice, we monitored their body weight throughout the treatment period. We observed that compared to the wild type (WT) group, the body weight of mice in the simulated microgravity (SMG) group showed a declining trend from Day 0 to Day 7, then gradually returned to normal growth, and stabilized after Day 21 (Figure S1b). Statistical analysis of the body weight differences between the two groups on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 revealed that the body weight of the SMG group was significantly lower than that of the WT group on Days 7, 14, and 21 (Figure 1b). This suggests that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have caused damage to the mice, leading to a decrease in body weight. Although the mice gradually adapted and returned to normal growth after Day 7, there was still a difference compared to the WT group. Furthermore, on Day 42, we performed autopsies on the mice and analyzed their main organ indices, finding no significant change in the heart index but a significant decrease in the liver, spleen, and thymus indices, indicating that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have affected the mice’s digestive and immune systems (Figure 1b).

(d) Microstructure parameters of mouse femurs after 42 days of microgravity treatment, including BV/TV (bone volume fraction), Tb. Th (trabecular thickness), Tb. N (trabecular number), Ct.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group.To determine whether the damage caused by the 3D-Clinostat treatment was due to simulated microgravity, we investigated the osteoporosis condition of the mice’s hindlimb femurs. Osteoporosis is a characteristic effect of the body under microgravity stress, and therefore, changes in femur-related indices can be used as a basis for judging the effectiveness of the microgravity simulation [38,39]. First, we examined the femur index, femur length, and femur diameter of the mice’s hindlimb right femur and found no significant differences after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat (Figure S2). Then, we used Micro-CT and HE staining to assess the morphological structure of the mouse femur. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse femur from Micro-CT images showed that the number of trabeculae in the femur tissue was significantly reduced after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, with sparse arrangement and even fractures, wider trabecular spacing, and increased separation (Figure 1c). HE staining for the morphological examination of the bone tissue of the right hindlimb femur revealed that in the WT group, the trabeculae were clear, evenly distributed, neatly arranged, with a larger thickness and smaller spacing, closely linked, and the marrow cavity was clear with a relatively intact structure (Figure 1c). In contrast, the model group mice showed significantly thinner and narrower trabeculae, with increased spacing, loose and incomplete arrangement, and areas of trabecular loss. Furthermore, we measured the microstructural parameters of the cancellous bone and found that after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, the BV/TV (bone volume fraction), Tb. N (trabecular number), Tb. Th (trabecular thickness), and Ct. Th (cortical thickness) were significantly decreased, while the Tb. Sp (trabecular separation) and trabecular bone pattern factor significantly increased (Figure 1d). These findings collectively indicate that the mice’s femurs exhibited a significant state of osteoporosis, suggesting the successful establishment of the microgravity mouse model.2.2. Microgravity-Induced Imbalance in Mouse Gut Microbiota Microgravity, as an environmental stressor in spaceflight, induces physiological changes including alterations in the intestinal tissue and gut microbiota [40]. Through HE staining of colonic tissue, we observed that simulated microgravity (SMG) caused damage to the colonic lumen, characterized by thinning of the epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced crypt damage (Figure 2a). We also observed that the feces of the SMG-treated mice were softer and more yellowish, whereas those of the WT group were normal, dark brown, and granular, with a moderate texture (Figure 2b). The differences in fecal status indicated gastrointestinal dysfunction and poor food digestion and absorption in the SMG-treated mice. Concurrent with the colonic tissue damage, we found a significant increase in the secretion of intestinal cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in SMG-treated mice (Figure 2c). Changes in the intestinal physiological environment led to alterations in the gut microbiota. To investigate whether microgravity restructured the mouse gut microbiota, we analyzed and compared the diversity differences between SMG and WT groups, including α-diversity and β-diversity indices. Among the α-diversity indices, the Shannon and Simpson indices decreased in the SMG group compared to the WT group (p < 0.05) (Figure 2d,e). Analysis methods for β-diversity, including unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA, Figure 2f), Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2g), and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA, Figure 2h), were employed to study the similarities or differences in sample community composition. We found that samples from the SMG group clustered together, distinct from those of the WT group, regardless of the β-diversity analysis method used. Additionally, by statistically analyzing the number of significantly different microorganisms at various taxonomic levels between SMG and WT groups (Figure 2i), we identified 6 significantly different phyla (Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and Deferribacteres, Figure S3a), 7 significantly different classes, including Bacilli, Acidobacteria, Deferribacteres, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (Figure S3b), as well as 7 significantly different orders (Figure S3c), 15 significantly different families (Figure S3d), and 26 significantly different genera (Figure S3e).

Microgravity-Induced Dysbiosis Leads to Metabolic Imbalance in Liver and Brain The composition of the mouse gut microbiota is closely related to its function, and local intestinal functional changes may affect the host’s physiology [41]. To explore the functional characteristics of the gut microbiota after microgravity restructuring, we focused on the KEGG predictions involving cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, and metabolism. We found that the functional differences in the gut microbiota were mainly enriched in 49 related pathways of metabolic functions and 14 related pathways of organismal system functions (Figure 3a). To more intuitively discover the significance of the altered metabolic pathways, we focused on the changed pathway enrichment in the metabolism and organismal systems at KEGG level 2. The study found that secondary pathways related to metabolic functions mainly involved lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (Figure 3b). Those related to organismal system functions primarily concerned digestive system metabolism, the nervous system, and the endocrine system (Figure 3c). Furthermore, tertiary pathways involved in lipid metabolism included glycerolipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation (Figure 3d). Tertiary pathways related to the digestive system included mineral absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, and salivary secretion (Figure 3e). Pathways involved in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites included tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, carbapenem biosynthesis, and phenazine biosynthesis (Figure 3f). Pathways related to the nervous and endocrine systems included the glucagon signaling pathway, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, estrogen signaling pathway, and prolactin signaling pathway (Figure 3g). These results suggest that microgravity restructured the composition and function of the gut microbiota, causing damage to the host’s lipid metabolic functions and the health of the digestive system, including the gut and liver, as well as the nervous and endocrine systems involving the brain.

Replicability of Gut Microbiota in Mice Under Microgravity To further explore the replicability of gut microbiota, we used the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) technique to intragastrically administer the fecal suspension of mice in the SMG group to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and this group was marked as FMT. The intestinal contents of this group were analyzed by 16S sequencing, and the microbiota structure was compared with those of the WT and SMG groups. We found that the α diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index) of the gut microbiota in the WT group mice was significantly different from that in the SMG group and the FMT group (Figure 4a,b). For β-diversity, it can also be seen from UPGMA (Figure 4c), PCA (Figure 4d), and PCoA (Figure 4e) that the WT group was significantly independent in spatial distance from the other two groups, while the gut microbiota diversity of the SMG group and the FMT group showed a highly overlapping state. By analyzing the microbiota structure among the three groups using Circos software (version 0.69-9), it was also found that the gut microbiota in the SMG and FMT groups were very similar in composition structure and were clearly distinguishable from the WT group (Figure 4f). Comparing the differences in the top 15 gut microbiota with relative abundances in mice under the three different treatment methods at the phylum, class, and order levels (Figure 4g–i), similar results were obtained. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of gut microbiota characteristics among FMT, SMG, and WT group mice. (a,b) Differences in α diversity: Shannon index (a) and Simpson index.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, ** p < 0.01. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance.In addition, we counted the total number of microorganisms with significant differences at each taxonomic level between FMT and WT and identified 6 phyla, 7 classes, 8 orders, 16 families, and 38 genera with significant differences (Figure 5a). This was close to the number of microorganisms with significant differences obtained at each taxonomic level between SMG and WT. Furthermore, to analyze the gut microbiota related to the microgravity effect, we screened the common differential microbiota at each taxonomic level between the WT group and the SMG group as well as between the WT group and the FMT group. It was found that there were 5, 6, 6, 10, and 23 common differential bacteria at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels, respectively (Figure 5b–f). In Figure S4a–e, we showed the specific up-regulation and down-regulation trends of the common differential bacteria in the SMG and FMT groups compared with the WT group. We found that the up-regulation and down-regulation trends of each genus were consistent in the SMG group and the FMT group. These common differential genera between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT may play an important role in the response of gut microbiota to microgravity stress. The above results indicate that FMT can reproduce the characteristics of gut microbiota under microgravity well, whether in terms of microbiota diversity, structure, differences at each taxonomic level, or up-regulation and down-regulation trends.

Microgravity Induces an Imbalance of Serum Metabolites in the Body Changes in the gut microbiota are closely related to nutrient absorption and metabolism, which can lead to alterations in a multitude of endogenous small molecule metabolites in the serum, including highly polar amino acids, glucose, nucleosides, as well as less polar lipids and sterols [42]. Monitoring these fluctuations in serum metabolites can provide insights into the biochemical activities within an organism, thereby assessing the stress response and health status under specific environmental conditions. To explore the reconstructive effects of microgravity on mouse serum metabolites, we employed LC–MS technology to analyze the metabolic profiles of the mice’s serum. To distinguish the differences in serum metabolites among the three groups, orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted. All sample data points fell within the 95% confidence interval (CI). R2X and R2Y were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model construction, while Q2 reflected the predictive power of the model. The OPLS-DA model revealed distinct metabolic profiles among the three groups in both the ESI positive ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.692, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.803; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.536, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.765, Figure 6a–e) and the negative ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.625, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.929; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.562, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.911, Figure 6f–j).

(i,j) The 200 replacement tests for SMG versus WT group and FMT versus WT group in the negative source model (n = 6).Similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity, we observed that the serum metabolite profiles of the SMG group and the FMT group were essentially overlapping, while being significantly separated from the WT group. The similar microbial community characteristics and serum metabolic profiles between the SMG and FMT groups suggest that microgravity may alter the serum metabolic spectrum by restructuring the gut microbiota of the mice. This finding implies that the changes in the gut microbiota under microgravity conditions could be a key factor in the metabolic shifts observed in the serum, potentially leading to a better understanding of the physiological impacts of microgravity on the organism.2.6. Microgravity-Induced Disruption of Serum Metabolites by the Gut Microbiota Leading to Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders To explore the impact of microgravity-altered metabolic profiles on the organism, we further analyzed the significantly different metabolites (SDMs) and their functions. Based on the variable importance projection (VIP) being greater than 1 and a p-value less than 0.05, we identified 27 differentially upregulated metabolites and 68 differentially downregulated metabolites in the SMG group compared to the WT group. Similarly, 32 metabolites were increased, while 42 were decreased in the FMT group compared to the WT group (Figure 7a). To uncover the metabolites closely associated with the gut microbiota, we found 61 core SDMs that appeared in both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT (Figure 7b,c). Using MetaboAnalyst 6.0, we classified these 61 core SDMs, with 56 being attributed to their respective subcategories. The top five categories of compounds by the number of SDMs were fatty acids and conjugates, accounting for 23.21% of the total, with 13 metabolites; amino acids, peptides, and analogs, representing 19.64%, with 11 metabolites; and fatty acid esters, making up 5.36%, with 3 metabolites (Figure 7d). This suggests that both the SMG and FMT groups exhibited evident disruptions in lipid and amino acid metabolism compared to the WT group. Figure 7.

(i) Analysis of pathways jointly regulated by differential metabolites between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance.To investigate the health effects of the metabolic disorders induced by microgravity, we performed KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the SMG group compared to the WT group. The top 20 pathways affected were primarily involved in metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In terms of metabolism, 25 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, 7 in amino acid metabolism, and 5 in nucleotide metabolism. Regarding organismal systems, eight SDMs impacted the digestive system, and five affected the endocrine system. For environmental information processing, nine SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and three in signal transduction (Figure 7e). Similarly, we conducted KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the FMT group compared to the WT group, revealing that the top 20 pathways were also related to metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In metabolism, 18 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, and 16 in amino acid metabolism. For organismal systems, 14 SDMs impacted the digestive system. In environmental information processing, 10 SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and 4 in signal transduction (Figure 7f). Furthermore, to explore the role of the gut microbiota in the physiological disorders induced by microgravity, we analyzed the common metabolic pathways involved by the SDMs (differential metabolites) of both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, identifying 48 pathways (Figure 7g). Consistent with the predicted functional impacts of gut microbiota under microgravity, the shared metabolic pathways included lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism in metabolism; the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems; and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing (Figure 7h). Tables S1 and S2 list the shared pathways for SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT, respectively. Additionally, we compared the 48 metabolic pathways involving 42 common SDMs between the SMG and FMT groups with those identified in the SMG and FMT groups, finding 42 shared pathways (Figure 7i, Table S3). Interestingly, these pathways were primarily involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism in metabolism, the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems, and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing. This suggests that the imbalance of the gut microbiota under microgravity may lead to host lipid and neuroendocrine disorders, with the 61 common SDMs potentially playing a crucial role in these physiological responses. To elucidate the role of these 61 common differential metabolites in the main physiological effects induced by microgravity, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, digestive system, nervous system, endocrine system, membrane transport, and signal transduction, we performed technical analysis of their involvement in the metabolic pathways of interest. We found that several common differential metabolites (e.g., L-Glutamine, L-Leucine, Dodecanoic acid, etc.) were involved in the primary physiological effects triggered by microgravity (Table S4). Based on these results, we hypothesize that the imbalance of the gut microbiota induced by microgravity may lead to significant changes in key serum metabolites, which in turn could cause hepatic and cerebral metabolic disorders.2.7. Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders Induced by Microgravity The findings from gut microbiota and serum metabolomics suggest that microgravity may cause an imbalance in the gut microbiota, leading to disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolism, and potentially inducing functional damage to the digestive and endocrine systems. The liver, being the primary organ involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism within the digestive system, and the brain, as the central control hub of the nervous and endocrine systems, are of particular interest [43,44]. To verify the hypothesis that microgravity-induced restructuring of the gut microbiota could lead to metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, we examined the morphological structure of the liver and brain in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups of mice using HE staining and magnetic resonance imaging. In the pathological sections of mouse liver tissue and quantification the vesicular steatosis, we observed micro/macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver), inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, more vacuole, and higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole in the SMG group (Figure 8a and Figure S5). The FMT group showed minor fatty degeneration, inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, medium vacuole, and less higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the brain revealed that the volumes of various brain regions, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, were expanded in the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, although not significantly (Figure 8b,c). Furthermore, we assessed potential brain functional abnormalities using the Barnes maze and Y-maze. The Barnes maze was used to evaluate spatial memory in mice [45]. As shown in Figure 8d, we categorized the paths of mice from all groups during the Barnes maze experiment (including the four days of training) into five characteristics. We observed that the distribution of latency times for mice in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups increased in the 90–120 s range, while those in the 0–30 s range decreased (Figure 8f). Scoring revealed that the SMG group had lower scores than the FMT, which in turn was lower than the WT (Table S5). Additionally, a daily analysis of latency times during the Barnes maze experiment (Figure 8e) showed no significant differences in latency among the three groups during the first two days. However, on the third day, the SMG group’s time to find the goal hole was significantly longer than that of the WT group (p < 0.05), with no significant difference between the FMT and WT groups. From the fourth to the fifth day, the escape latency of both the SMG and FMT groups was significantly higher than that of the WT group. Figure 8.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group.The Y-maze was used to assess the working memory differences among the SMG, FMT, and WT groups. We found that the SMG group had significantly fewer spontaneous alternations compared to the WT group, indicating memory loss (p < 0.001), and the FMT group showed a similar trend (p < 0.05), suggesting that the gut microbiota may be involved in the cognitive dysfunction induced by microgravity (Figure 8g). Subsequently, we also examined the antioxidant capacity and neurotransmitter levels in the brain tissue of the SMG, FMT, and WT groups and found that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE levels in the brain tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA and GABA levels were significantly lower (Figure 9b,e). The antioxidant capacity data in liver tissue also indicated that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels in the liver tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA, ALT, and AST showed opposite results (Figure 9a,c,d). Serum tests also revealed that the levels of AST, ALT, TC, TG, and LDL in the WT group were significantly lower than in the other two groups, with HDL being significantly higher (Figure 10a). Additionally, the levels of cortisol and ACTH (cortisol and adrenocortic hormone) in serum were on average lower in the other two groups. Notably, the level of corticosterone, although not significantly elevated in the FMT group as with microgravity treatment, still showed a certain increase, suggesting neuroendocrine disorders in the SMG and FMT groups (Figure 10b). These results collectively suggest that microgravity may induce metabolic disorders in the liver and brain through the imbalance of the gut microbiota, leading to oxidative stress and further promoting structural or functional damage to the liver and brain.

Discussion The complex environment of space, including strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures and microgravity, can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [46,47]. During medium- and long-term spaceflight, abnormal changes in multiple systems such as the liver and brain of astronauts, as well as in the neuro–endocrine–immune regulatory network, are the key and difficult points in spaceflight-related research. Although increasing evidence suggests that microgravity is involved in the abnormal changes in the liver and brain after spaceflight, the specific pathways through which it induces these abnormalities remain unclear. Establishing appropriate models is very important for solving this problem. To avoid the impact of unnecessary mechanical injuries on the results, in this study, we established a microgravity model of mice using the 3D-Clinostat and confirmed the feasibility of the new model through the commonly used evaluation methods of previous ground-based models. During the establishment of the new model, the daily food and water intake, which did not show significant changes, indicated that the physiological state of the mice was affected by environmental stress rather than diet. This environmental stress effect was very similar to the stress effect under real microgravity, suggesting that to some extent it was worthy of being a choice for ground-based simulation experiments. Obvious stress effects, such as weight loss, decreased organ indices, and bone loss, are common clinical manifestations of the microgravity effects in the head-down bed rest experiment (for humans) and the tail suspension experiment (for mice) [48,49,50]. Furthermore, we separately explored the impact of microgravity, one of the space environmental factors, on the liver and brain tissues of mice. The serum metabolome results, serving as macroscopic manifestations and preliminary diagnostic bases for the body’s condition, revealed obvious disorders in lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as abnormalities in the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in the model group mice compared to the WT group. The excessively high levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), TC (total cholesterol), TG (triglyceride), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and the overly low level of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) in the serum confirmed that the model group mice had clinical symptoms of disorders in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Similar to our results, increases in the levels of AST and ALT were also observed in the ground-based experiments on tail-suspended rats for 2 months and 42 days [21,51]. Likewise, during missions on the International Space Station, increases in TC, TG, and LDL in human serum were also observed, along with a decrease in the HDL level [16]. It can be seen that spaceflight has a serious impact on the body’s lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and our results also prove that the single factor of microgravity also promotes such metabolic disorders, which may cause varying degrees of harm to the body’s systems. Metabolic disorders and abnormalities in the digestive system are closely related to the liver. In this study, the livers of the model group mice showed diffuse microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as abnormalities in antioxidant indicators such as T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase). These changes also frequently appeared in previous studies. Japanese quails that stayed on the Mir orbital station for five days showed a large number of lipid droplet depositions in almost all liver cells of all the flight chicks, and the total amount of lipid droplets was nearly five times higher than that of the ground control chicks [52]. Meanwhile, the accumulation of lipids in the liver led to the consumption of adipocytes in the bone marrow of these flight chicks. Abnormal lipid accumulation was also observed in the livers of all spaceflight mice as measured by Oil Red O staining [53]. In multiple spaceflight missions involving mice and rats, the liver system also exhibited varying degrees of lipid deposition, degeneration, and inflammatory damage [20,53]. In the ground-based experiment on 42-day head-down bed rest (HDBR) monkeys, compared with the WT group, the HDBR group monkeys also showed slight liver damage, with fatty vacuoles and inflammatory cell aggregation appearing in the liver [54]. The above results indicate that both spaceflight and the single factor of microgravity can lead to liver dysfunction, cause changes in lipid metabolism, and induce clinical features similar to those of early non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Besides abnormal liver metabolism and function, we also found abnormalities in the nervous system and endocrine system of the model group mice, which are directly related to the brain. In this study, the brain region structures of the model group mice, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, did not show significant changes. However, the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues (T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA) decreased. In the ground-based experiment of hindlimb suspension (HLS), the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the model group rats were significantly lower than those of the WT group [55]. Corresponding to the abnormal antioxidant function of the brain, the brain function of the model group mice was also affected, and their spatial memory and working memory were damaged to varying degrees. The memory ability of mice is closely related to the secretion of various neurotransmitters, especially Glu, ACH, 5-HT, DOPA, and NE. The impairment of memory ability may indicate that Glu is an amino acid neurotransmitter. It is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Moreover, Glu plays an important role in learning and memory, neuronal plasticity, and brain development [56,57]. ACH is a cholinergic neurotransmitter. They play an important role in regulating attention, enhancing learning and memory ability, and processing sensory information [58,59]. 5-HT, DA, and NE are monoamine neurotransmitters that can enhance the excitability of the brain and the ability of learning and memory [60,61,62,63]. 5-HT plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, and its receptor 5-HT1A regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton through the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, inducing neurogenesis and synapse formation [64]. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter. The reduction in dopamine content in the brain can lead to the loss, degeneration, or death of neurons, further impairing learning and memory [65,66]. NE has a very wide range of functions in the brain and is involved in the regulation of almost all brain functions, including learning and memory, attention, consciousness, alertness, and emotion. As expected, in our study, the secretion of several important neurotransmitters (Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE) was abnormal, which might be the cause of the brain memory dysfunction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the physiological disorders and pathological development of diseases in organisms are closely related to gut microbiota. Hundreds to thousands of kinds of bacteria colonize in the human intestine, and their quantity is so large that it far exceeds the number of human cells [67]. Gut microbiota mainly colonize in intestinal mucus, the intestinal lumen, and feces, and the number of genes they carry is more than 100 times that of human genes [68]. The changes in human physiological functions are closely associated with the intestinal microbial community. The mutually beneficial intestinal microbial ecology is of great importance for the homeostasis of metabolism and the liver–brain system [69,70]. Intestinal microorganisms play a role in metabolic regulation, intestinal peristalsis and barrier homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and neural signal transduction [71]. The relationship between the host and microorganisms is complex, and when an imbalance occurs, it may lead to abnormalities in the body’s systems. We have found that compared with the control group, the model group and the fecal microbiota transplantation group of mice exhibited gut physiological abnormalities (intestinal structure and tissue cytokines), fecal abnormalities, and gut microbiota imbalance under conditions of liver–brain metabolic disorders and functional abnormalities. The damage and inflammatory response in the colonic tissue of the SMG group mice suggest the disruption of the intestinal barrier and an abnormal physiological environment. This may directly affect the stability of the gut microbiota [72]. The group’s yellowish and soft feces further confirm this point [73]. Furthermore, we have discussed the common differential gut microbiota of the model group mice and the FMT group mice relative to the WT group. It was found that the imbalanced gut microbiota was found to be related to liver–brain abnormalities in functional prediction. This may be because microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota, thus inducing liver–brain abnormalities. Studies suggest that microgravity stress can change the physiological environment of the intestine and also have an impact on the virulence of intestinal bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics. Microgravity, low fluid shear, and microgravity-related dynamics have been proved to play a role in microbial gene expression, physiology, and pathogenesis [74]. Important intestinal bacterial metabolites such as valeric acid, indole-3-propionic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol play significant roles in the metabolism and functions of the intestine, liver, and brain. To explore how gut microbiota affects liver–brain abnormalities, we discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and significantly changed differential metabolites and analyzed the connection between typical differential metabolites and liver–brain abnormalities. The research results showed that the significantly decreased oleic acid is related to liver tissue health and lipid metabolism. 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; valeric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; adrenic acid is related to the secretion of neurotransmitters; L-glutamine is related to amino acid metabolism; and L-leucine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. N(6)-Methyllysine is related to the brain and neurotransmitters. N-acetylglutamine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Glycyl-arginine is related to the brain, and m-chlorohippuric acid is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole-3-propionic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Ketoleucine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Equol is a metabolite of gut microbiota. As for the significantly increased ones, D-pipecolic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is related to the liver–brain system and amino acid metabolism. Salicylic acid is related to the liver. 3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. 3-Methoxy-4-Hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate is related to the brain and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE). In order to explore the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress, this study used MetaMapp (version 2.0.1 45) to analyze the interactions between different metabolites and screen for key metabolites in the stress response of mice induced by microgravity at the metabolic level. MetaMapp is a tool for metabolomics data analysis and visualization. Its main function is to construct a network map of metabolites by integrating chemical similarity and mass spectral similarity matrices, as well as the KEGG reaction database [75]. It helps researchers map metabolomics data to biochemical modules, aiding biological interpretation. The network maps generated by MetaMapp clearly show the relationships and interactions among metabolites, which is very helpful for understanding complex metabolic networks. Moreover, MetaMapp does not rely on genomic information, allowing it to independently map and visualize metabolites. This makes it suitable for studying organisms without complete genomic information. As shown in Figure S6, under the influence of microgravity, the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism formed a large metabolic network. L-Leucine and ketoleucine were the key node metabolites connecting the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. Specifically, L-Leucine linked amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism through N(6)-Methyllysine and L-Glutamine, while ketoleucine connected lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism through valeric acid. In addition, among the 61 common differential metabolites, we identified a series of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, including 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, aleric acid, D-Pipecolic acid, Indole-3-propionic acid, alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid, 3-Hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol. We hypothesized that these 12 metabolites play an important indicative role in revealing the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and the apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress. Furthermore, to briefly verify this hypothesis, we conducted Pearson correlation analyses among these 12 differential metabolites, differential metabolic bacterial genera, and significantly changed the physiological indicators of the liver and brain. The results showed a strong correlation in general (Figure S7). Given that valeric acid is in a key position in the lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism network under microgravity stress and is also an important metabolite of the gut microbiota, connecting the differential bacterial genera, we speculate that microgravity stress causes the relevant bacterial genera to respond, leading to changes in the content of this compound in the intestine. This compound is absorbed into the blood through the intestine, causing changes in its content in the blood. Such changes, via the nodes, trigger abnormalities in metabolites related to neurotransmitter secretion and lipid metabolism in the amino acid metabolism or lipid metabolism network, further inducing metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. However, this speculation still requires further experimental verification. Finally, it is important to note that in our results, the FMT group did replicate some of the differences between the SMG and WT groups to a certain extent. However, there are still some differences between the FMT and WT groups, and even greater differences between the SMG and WT groups. This suggests that SMG treatment causes metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, which may involve gut microbiota imbalance, but also other mechanisms, including the following. (1) Impaired intestinal barrier function. Microgravity increases gut permeability, allowing bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation [76,77]. The liver is particularly susceptible to this inflammation as it filters blood from the gut. Increased inflammation can impair liver function and lead to metabolic disorders. Tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells are crucial for maintaining gut barrier integrity, and microgravity may disrupt these junctions, further increasing gut permeability. This can lead to the translocation of bacteria and their products to the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [78]. (2) Inflammatory response. Microgravity can activate immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [79]. These cytokines can reach the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and impairing their functions [80]. Additionally, the chronic low-grade inflammation induced by microgravity can have a sustained negative impact on liver–brain metabolism. It can cause insulin resistance, fat accumulation, and oxidative stress, all of which promote the development of metabolic disorders. (3) Bile acid metabolism changes. Microgravity can affect bile acid synthesis in the liver [34,54]. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion and absorption, and changes in their synthesis can lead to alterations in lipid metabolism, negatively affecting liver function and promoting the development of fatty liver disease. Bile acids also play a role in regulating signaling pathways related to liver–brain metabolism, and microgravity may disrupt these pathways, leading to metabolic dysfunction [81]. (4) Psychological factors. Microgravity can cause psychological stress and anxiety in astronauts [82]. These factors can negatively affect liver–brain metabolism [83]. Stress can lead to the release of stress hormones (such as cortisol), which can impair liver function and cause metabolic disorders. Anxiety can also affect brain function and lead to cognitive dysfunction.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Materials and Reagents Vancomycin (50 mg/kg), Neomycin (100 mg/kg), Metronidazole (100 mg/kg), Ampicillin (1 mg/mL), and 4% Paraformaldehyde were purchased from Macleans Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Acetonitrile (99.9%), Methanol (99.9%), and Diethyl Ether (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Standard compounds of neurotransmitters Serotonin (5-HT), Norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DOPA), Acetylcholine (ACH), Glutamate (Glu), and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).4.2. Structure and Parameters of the 3D-Clinostat The 3D-Clinostat was purchased from the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The principles and methods for simulating microgravity were referenced from the previous literature and modified based on our team’s experience [84]. The parameters of the 3D-Clinostat are as follows: rotating frames: 2, capable of independent rotation; sample stage: area 400 mm × 300 mm, load capacity 0–3 kg; rotation mode: random; rotation speed: ±0–10 rpm, with speed resolution of 0.1 rpm, and capable of long-term continuous operation (≥30 days).4.3. Animals Experimental Design C57BL/6 male mice (specific pathogen free, SPF grade, 6 weeks, weighing (20 ± 2)g) and sterilized mouse growth maintenance feed were obtained from Changsheng Biotech (Benxi, China). The brief experimental protocol is as follows. Two batches of mice were sequentially obtained. For the first batch, the mice were randomly divided into two groups (6 mice per group): group 1 (SMG), mice were used to establish a microgravity model and investigate its effects; and group 2 (WT), mice served as a control reference. In the second batch (group 3, FMT), mice underwent fecal microbiota transplantation to replicate the gut microbiota structure of the SMG group, thereby exploring the role of the gut microbiota in microgravity effects. The details are as follows. Mice were housed in a controlled environment at 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle for 1–2 weeks for acclimation, with food and water provided ad libitum. For the establishment of the microgravity simulation model using a 3D-Clinostat, after two weeks of acclimation, the first batch of mice underwent a one-week adaptation training on the clinostat (6 h of rotation on the first day, followed by 18 h of rest; 12 h of rotation for the second and third days, with 12 h of rest; 24 h of rotation on the fourth day, and a rest day on the fifth; and another 24 h of rotation on the sixth day, with a rest day on the seventh). On the eighth day (denoted as Day 1), the mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 6): the 3D-Clinostat group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes (Patent No.: ZL202022855659.9) and the WT group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes only, labeled as SMG (Simulated Microgravity) and WT (Wild Type), respectively. The SMG group underwent a 42-day rotation treatment. During this period, both groups were fed with solid agar and normal growth maintenance feed (with water and food separated inside the survival boxes), and daily weight, water, and food intake were recorded. The water and food were replaced regularly, and the survival boxes were cleaned to ensure a comfortable living environment for the mice. After the 42 days of rotation, fecal samples were collected from both groups. Some samples were directly stored at −80 °C for 16S sequencing after morphological observation, and others were stored with 30% glycerol at −80 °C for subsequent FMT. The learning and memory capabilities of the mice were assessed using the Barnes maze and Y-maze tests. Subsequently, small animal magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan the brains of both groups to observe any differences in brain region volume and morphology between SMG and WT mice. After dissection, bilateral femurs were collected for length and weight measurement. Micro-CT and HE staining were then used to observe the morphology of the mouse femur tissue to confirm the success of the microgravity simulation. Intestinal, liver, serum, and brain samples from both groups were collected for further testing. For the establishment of the pseudo-germ-free mouse model induced by a mixture of antibiotics, we referred to the studies of Hoedt EC, Hueston CM, Cash N, et al. [85]. In brief, six mice after one week of acclimation were intragastrically administered a mixture of vancomycin (50 mg/kg), neomycin (100 mg/kg), and metronidazole (100 mg/kg) every 12 h, with a gavage volume of 10 mL/kg; ampicillin (1 mg/mL) was also added to the drinking water. This intervention was continued, and mouse feces were collected daily for anaerobic culture counts. On the seventh day, we found that the total number of viable bacteria in the feces was less than 1 CFU/mg, indicating the successful establishment of germ-free mice. After the pseudo-germ-free mice underwent the same adaptation training as before, they were housed in 3D-printed mouse survival boxes without simulated microgravity treatment for 42 days. During this period, the feces from the SMG group were used to intragastrically administer the pseudo-germ-free mice twice every seven days. After 42 days, the group was labeled as the FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplantation) group. Feces were collected as before, and the mice’s learning and memory abilities were assessed. The mice were then dissected, and their livers, serum, and brains were collected for subsequent tests. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology (Approval Number: IACUC-2023003, 15 February 2023; IACUC-2024141, 10 December 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.4.4. Micro-CT of Bone Tissue The right femurs of mice fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were scanned using a Micro-CT scanner (Quantum GX2, PerkinElmer, Berlin, Germany) with appropriate scanning parameters. The scanning parameters were set as follows: voltage at 85 kV, current at 200 μA, and exposure time at 384 ms. The images were reconstructed using GPU NRecon Server V1.7.4.2 software. Microstructural analysis of the bone was conducted on a region located 0.5 mm above the growth plate in the metaphysis of the distal femur, with a width of 0.5 mm. This analysis provides insights into the bone’s microarchitecture, which is crucial for understanding the effects of microgravity simulation on bone tissue.4.5. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment used was a small animal MRI scanner from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. After anesthetizing the mice with 5% isoflurane to stabilize their condition, scans were conducted. A three-dimensional T2-weighted imaging with a rapid acquisition and relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence was employed to acquire structural images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) of 1800 ms, echo time (TE) of 45 ms, a flip angle of 90°, a sampling matrix of 256 × 256, voxel size of 0.078 mm × 0.078 mm × 0.512 mm, 32 slices, and slice thickness/spacing of 0.512/0 mm. The images, originally in DICOM format, were converted to NIFTI format. ITKSNAP 3.6.0 and MATLAB R2022a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) software were utilized to automatically and manually remove the mouse brain scalp. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed using SPM 8.3.2.0 in conjunction with MATLAB software.4.6. Behavioral Experiments (Barnes Maze and Y-Maze) The Y-maze and Barnes maze are authoritative tests for assessing short-term memory and spatial learning in mice [86,87]. The specific methods are as follows. The Barnes maze consists of a gray-white circular platform (diameter = 122 cm) with 20 holes evenly spaced around the perimeter. One hole (the target hole) is connected to an escape box that is not perceptible to the experimental animal, while the other holes have no such connection. Before the experimental day, each mouse is allowed a 5 min adaptive exploration in the device. During the subsequent 5 days of training, mice are forced to find a hidden box under the stimulation of bright light. The trial ends when the mouse enters the target hole or when the exploration lasts for 5 min. Each mouse’s escape box is positioned in the same location. To eliminate the influence of the previous mouse, the device is wiped with 75% ethanol before starting a new trial. The escape tracks and time (escape latency) were recorded by SuperMaze V2.0 (Shanghai Xinruan Information Technology, Shanghai, China). The Y-maze comprises three arms (35 cm long, 15 cm high, 5 cm wide) that converge at the same angle (120°). The mouse is placed in the center of the maze and allowed to explore spontaneously for 8 min. During the exploration, the total number of arm entries (Nt) and the number of successive entries into different arms in overlapping triplet sets (Na) are recorded. All data are recorded through SuperMaze software (Shanghai Xinruan Information Technology, Shanghai, China). The percentage of spontaneous alternation is calculated using the following formula: spontaneous alternation = (Na/(Nt − 2)) × 100%.4.7. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining Following the methods of previous studies, intestinal and liver tissues were carefully collected and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) [88,89]. Briefly, after fixing the tissues in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 24 h, they were embedded in paraffin. The tissues were then sectioned into 5 μm slices and stained with HE before being observed under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).4.8. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) Inflammation-related cytokines in colonic tissue, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as the levels of serum ATCH, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), were measured using corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.4.9. Detection of Lipid Levels, Liver Function, and Antioxidant Capacity in Liver and Brain The serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), as well as the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in both serum and liver, were measured using commercial diagnostic kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, China) according to the instructions. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver and brain tissues were also analyzed with the respective commercial diagnostic kits.4.10. Detection of Neurotransmitters and Corticosteroids Mouse brain tissue samples (20 mg) were washed with sterile saline. Deionized water (200 μL) and a mixture of acetonitrile–methanol solution (800 μL) were added to the brain tissue samples. The mixture was sonicated at 4 °C, then vortexed and quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen. The mixture was allowed to return to 25 °C, and the process was repeated three times to obtain a homogenate of brain tissue. The contents of representative neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DOPA), acetylcholine (ACH), glutamate (Glu), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain tissue homogenate were detected using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The treatment method and testing conditions were referenced from the literature [90]. The expression levels of cortisol and corticosterone in serum were also measured by LC–MS. Briefly, diethyl ether (500 μL) was added to the serum samples (800 μL) and rotated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the upper organic phase was collected, and the process was repeated once more. The product was dried with nitrogen gas and then dissolved in methanol (200 μL), vortexed for 3 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (100 μL) was used for LC–MS detection. Reference standards for these substances were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA).4.11. DNA Extraction and 16S rDNA Sequencing Mouse feces were collected between 20:00 and 20:30, quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The detailed methods for DNA extraction from feces and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis are as follows. The total DNA was extracted using the TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primers used for the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rDNA are 343F: 5′-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′ and 798R: 5′-AGGGTATCTAATCCT-3′ (referencing the literature on the design of 16S rRNA gene primers for 454 pyrosequencing of the human foregut microbiome). Extraction and purification of genomic DNA were carried out using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA). The samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the sequencing analysis was performed by Shanghai OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using Usearch (version 7.1). Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were generated using QIIME2 (2018.11) in combination with the R-package vegan (version 3.5.3). Differential abundance analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.4.12. Serum Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis Serum metabolites were extracted using a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (2/1, v/v) by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered and used for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. A Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS UHPLC system coupled with a Q-Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiling in both positive and negative ESI modes. An ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) was employed for both positive and negative modes. Metabolites were identified using Progenesis QI 2.0 (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases such as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and LIPID MAPS, as well as self-built databases. Principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling’s T2 region, depicted as an ellipse in the score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) assesses the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, with variables having VIP > 1 considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, a default 7-round cross-validation was applied, excluding 1/seventh of the samples from the mathematical model in each round to prevent overfitting. The positive and negative data were combined to obtain a comprehensive dataset. Differential metabolites were selected based on a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values from the OPLS-DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student’s t-test on the normalized peak areas. Metabolites with VIP values > 1.0 and p values < 0.05 were considered differential metabolites. Metabolite classification and functional analysis were completed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and the KEGG database.4.13. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences between groups for 16S data were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while metabolic profiling data and physiological parameter data were evaluated using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. Conclusions Overall, in this study, the 3D-Clinostat was used to conduct ground simulation of the microgravity effect on mice. It was found that the number of trabeculae in the femoral tissues of mice was significantly reduced and osteoporosis was evident. The obvious osteoporotic state of the mouse femur indicated the successful establishment of the mouse microgravity model. Subsequently, based on the 16S data detection of the feces of the model group mice, it was discovered that microgravity reconstructed the gut microbiota of mice. Based on the functional enrichment analysis of the microbiota, it was found that microgravity might impair the functions of lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of the body as well as the health of systems including the intestine, liver, and brain. Then, through fecal microbiota transplantation, it was found that the serum metabolism of the model group and the FMT group was significantly different from that of the WT group, which was similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity data. Thus, the gut microbiota dependence of microgravity-induced metabolic disorders was determined, indicating that microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota. Based on the functional analysis of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of mice, we supposed that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to abnormal metabolism in the liver and brain tissues of the body. Finally, based on the serum metabolome data, the oxidation indicators of the brain and liver tissues and serum of the model group mice, as well as the detection of behavioral memory ability and neurotransmitters, it was verified that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to metabolic imbalance and functional abnormalities in the liver and brain tissues of the body. This study offers some references and potential directions for addressing astronauts’ health issues and designing life-support systems in space exploration. It also has practical application value for deepening the understanding of how living organisms adapt to the space environment. However, the data and conclusions obtained from the experiments still need to be verified by more real spaceflight missions. Meanwhile, this study has many deficiencies. For example, a veterinarian should conduct more comprehensive checks on the mice during the experiment to more accurately compare the health status differences among different groups. It is still unclear whether there is a direct association between the liver and brain tissue abnormalities induced by microgravity, and which gut bacteria are the key factors in this abnormality induced by microgravity. All of these require further research, exploration, and verification by researchers around the world.Acknowledgments We are grateful for the sequencing service provided by Oebiotech Company in Shanghai.

KEYWORDS: Sphingomonas, International Space Station, phytohormones, plant growth promotionINTRODUCTION Sphingomonas species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants (1–3). They possess diverse catabolic capabilities; for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccharides, was reported (2). Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in biofilm formation and eventually surface corrosion (4), and some aid in herbicide mineralization or degradation of pollutants (5–7). Sphingomonas paucimobilis has been isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water (8), ISS surfaces (9), and hospital clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised individuals (2, 10, 11). Recent reports have identified the role of some Sphingomonas species in plant growth promotion (5, 12–14). Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via different mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing phosphate, fixating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocontrol agents (5, 14–19). Phytohormones play a significant role in plant metabolism and defense mechanisms (20). For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for promoting cell division, elongation, and differentiation (21) and is involved in a wide range of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress tolerance (22, 23). Recent studies have detailed the role of Sphingomonas species in plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress tolerance. S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen fixation (14). Sphingomonas sp. LK11, isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant Tephrosia apollinea, was shown to produce auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and cadmium in tomato plants (12, 15, 24). In addition, genomic analysis of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress (15). Genomic analysis of Sphingomonas panacis DCY99T isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng identified genes for IAA production, phosphate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic compounds (5). Furthermore, Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community (13). The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hormones externally to the plants. In an ongoing microbial tracking experiment on the ISS, several microbial strains belonging to Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) were isolated from the ISS, and a third strain identified as S. paucimobilis was cultured from the Kennedy Space Center, Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF). After the isolation of Sphingomonas strains from the ISS (25, 26), a complete genome (∼4.4 Mbp) was also assembled from the shotgun reads retrieved from the same ISS environmental surface (26), resulting in the production of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) belonging to S. sanguinis. Given the persistence of Sphingomonas bacteria among spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and a growing body of evidence for Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth, this study applies comparative genomic analyses to identify genetic determinants that relate to plant growth-promoting features (PGPF) and highlights those that may be adaptive to growth on spaceflight-relevant environments and surfaces. Our findings report the presence of several determinants for the production of plant phytohormones, including several gene products promoting resistance to sources of abiotic stress, with emphasis on oxidative/osmotic stress resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and adaptation to sources of radiation. Further, the production of a phytohormone, IAA, by these isolates was confirmed using metabolomics. Moreover, intersection analysis of functional annotations and orthologous groups from the Sphingomonas species from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC-PHSF, ISS) revealed potential differences in gene contents involved in the horizontal gene transfer that are notably absent in their respective type strains. Taken together, our results show how characterization of microorganisms with respect to their ability to promote plant growth, including vegetables that can be used as a food source, will contribute to the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.RESULTS Abundance of Sphingomonas species in the ISS. Among the cultivable bacteria, three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC (FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identified as Sphingomonas species. All ISS strains were S. sanguinis, and the KSC strain was S. paucimobilis. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the draft genomes assembled were further used to confirm the identity of the species based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; Table 1), which was calculated to be ∼99% with the nearest type strain. Genomic characteristics and other details of the annotation are given in Table 1. The metagenomic data analysis identified 23 Sphingomonas species from flight 2, all of which were isolated from location 7, that is, a panel near the portable water dispenser (LAB) (Fig. 1). In addition, the reads obtained from flight 1 belonging to a single species, Sphingomonas sanxanigenens, were also seen in samples from flights 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). However, its location on the ISS varied across different flights. Reads obtained from flight 3 also showed the presence of S. paucimobilis from location 4, that is, the dining table (node 1). The metagenomic reads thus obtained from the ISS show that Sphingomonas species persisted across all three flights, with S. sanguinis being abundant among all Sphingomonas species in flight 2. Furthermore, the MAG sequence (ISS-IIF7SWP) exhibited >99.6% ANI with the type strain of S. sanguinis (Table 1). The MAG was derived from the exact location on the ISS where S. sanguinis isolates IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5 were retrieved using cultivation techniques. It was also confirmed that the MAG genome had >99% ANI value with the genomes of the S. sanguinis strains isolated from the ISS. The use of the culture-dependent and -independent methods thus confirms the presence of S. sanguinis on the ISS. TABLE 1.

BLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across each spaceflight genome and their type strains compared against the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each S. sanguinis (66.1 to 66.2%) and S. paucimobilis (65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11 (66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a substantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional identity among these spaceflight Sphingomonas genomes, their type strains, and the endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (Fig. 3). FIG 2. Open in a new tab Circular genome representations were constructed using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) version 0.95, with Sphingomonas sp. LK11 selected as the reference genome (chromosome and plasmids). The innermost ring (black) shows the GC content of the reference Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome. Subsequent rings illustrate the percent identity of the selected Sphingomonas genomes calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%). Starting from ring two, the order of the illustrated genomes is as follows: 2, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1; 3, S. paucimobilis LCT-SP1; 4, S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T; 5, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A; 6, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5; 7, S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8, S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T. The outermost ring displays randomly selected annotations originating from the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 chromosome.FIG 3. Open in a new tab Pangenome analysis of S. sanguinis, S. paucimobilis genomes obtained from space-relevant surfaces with their type strains, and Sphingomonas sp. LK11, generated by the Anvi’o software. Primary functional annotation in Anvi’o was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inflation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). Ordering of the pangenome display was determined using a Euclidean distance clustering algorithm and the provided ward linkage method. Beginning from the innermost ring and moving outward, rings 1 to 8 correspond to gene clusters identified in each of the analyzed Sphingomonas genomes in the following order: 1, Sphingomonas sp. LK11; 2, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1; 3, Sphingomonas LCT-SP1; 4, S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T; 5, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A; 6, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5; 7, S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8, S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T. Ring 9 shows a density plot of the number of genes within the identified gene clusters, and ring 10 highlights single-copy gene clusters (black). Rings 11 and 12 correspond to the geometric homogeneity index and functional homogeneity indices of similarity, with the former accounting for gaps in alignments, while the latter scores functional similarities by residue within the aligned sequences. The outermost ring represents the location of known Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) functional categories. The right-most bar chart corresponds to the number of singleton gene clusters, number of gene clusters, number of genes, total length, and GC content for each genome present in the analysis.Due to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the space Sphingomonas species and Sphingomonas sp. LK11, functional annotations for each of the spaceflight Sphingomonas genomes and their type strains were conducted to identify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs proposed for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (15) are likely also present in the analyzed S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis genomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database suggest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation in plants are also present in these select Sphingomonas strains, albeit with some species-specific patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubilization in soil appear to be conserved across all the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen production may be exclusive to the selected S. sanguinis strains. Furthermore, several pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be shared between these selected S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis genomes. Previous reports suggested that responses to oxidative stress in Sphingomonas sp. LK11 may promote plant host tolerance to abiotic stress via the amelioration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (12, 15, 27). Therefore, specific gene products related to oxidative stress resistance in space-associated Sphingomonas strains were further identified. Analysis of annotations generated by PGAP and eggNOG-MapperV2 suggested that space-associated Sphingomonas strains harbor multiple copies of several classes of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, and glutaredoxins. Next, we sought to identify metabolic pathways suggested to reduce the abundance of ROS, for instance, carotenoids, which are known for their antioxidant activity (28). Examination of PGAP and eggNOG annotations suggest that all Sphingomonas strains analyzed in this study possess the genetic repertoire (crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ) to produce the carotenoid zeaxanthin from the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (Fig. 4A). Further analysis also revealed the presence of an unnamed sterol desaturase family protein, often proximate to these gene clusters, which shared high identity to the crtG gene product identified in Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 (74% to 75% identity) (29). CrtG converts zeaxanthin to produce the yellow pigment nostoxanthin, a common carotenoid produced by Sphingomonas (30). Likewise, two pathways for the production of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose were also identified in both the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Trehalose serves a variety of functions across organisms, acting as a carbon source, a compatible solute, and a metabolite that provides protection against a variety of abiotic stressors (31). These results suggest that Sphingomonas strains can potentially synthesize trehalose from the otsA/B pathway, wherein a two-step mechanism catalyzes the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate from the condensation of glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose residues (otsA) and subsequent dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate into the disaccharide trehalose (otsB). Additionally, trehalose could also be produced in these bacteria through catabolism of α(1,4) glucose polymers into trehalose via the treY/Z pathway (Fig. 4B). FIG 4. Open in a new tab (A) Zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin pathway. (B) Genes discussed relevant to trehalose metabolism in S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis. In the first step of the otsA/B pathway, a condensation reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose synthesizes trehalose 6-phosphate (otsA). Second, a dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate catalyzed by otsB yields the product trehalose. Additionally, trehalose can also be formed from the rearrangement of the α(1,4) glycosidic bonds of glucose polymers to α(1) glycosidic bonds via treY, allowing for the hydrolysis of the terminal trehalose disaccharide via treZ. (C) Proposed pathway for IAA production in S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis using functional predictions generated by eggNOG-MapperV2. Enzyme classes are denoted in brackets, with gene, enzyme, or protein names provided where appropriate. Purple coloring denotes identified enzyme classes that were identified only in the analyzed S. paucimobilis spaceflight strains. Question marks (??) denote yet-to-be-validated reaction mechanisms in the proposed pathway. Chemical structures were constructed using the ChemDraw software.These findings suggest that the tested Sphingomonas species, including the strains sequenced from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role of these newly sequenced Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance.Indole-3-acetic acid production by S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains isolated from the ISS. One of the sources of IAA biosynthesis is the amino acid tryptophan, and analysis of the orthologous groups identified by the eggNOGv5 database suggested that the selected Sphingomonas strains possess the required tryptophan biosynthesis genes (trpA,B,C,D,E,F), consistent with observations from previous reports in the literature (5, 15). Leveraging the inclusion of several KEGG orthologs, enzyme classes, and KEGG reactions outputs via eggNOG-MapperV2, potential pathways for these Sphingomonas to synthesize IAA from tryptophan are proposed (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the functional annotations transferred from the EggNOGv5 database pointed to a group of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family proteins that may act as putative nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1), converting indole-3-acetonitrile directly to IAA. Similarly, each of the analyzed Sphingomonas strains harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase (putative monoamine oxidase EC 1.4.3.4), which likely promotes the conversion of tryptamine into indole-3-acetaldehyde. However, subsequent steps allowing the conversion of indole-3-acetaldehyde to IAA via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (EC 1.2.1.3) were exclusive to the analyzed S. paucimobilis genomes. Further, the presence of indole-pyruvate ferredoxin, an enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate into S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), was also exclusive to S. paucimobilis; however, it is unclear as to how S. paucimobilis may further alter S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA into IAA. While two putative mechanisms across both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis that may directly yield IAA from tryptophan-derived metabolites are supported by the results of functional annotation, we failed to identify canonical mechanisms for the formation of the upstream reactants in tryptophan metabolism, suggesting that novel mechanisms for IAA formation may occur in Sphingomonas and species-dependent pathways may supplement a shared metabolic pathway. Interestingly, while an auxin export carrier family protein was identified in each of the analyzed S. paucimobilis genomes, no such protein was identified in S. sanguinis. Since the genomic analysis of the spaceflight isolates revealed genetic signatures for the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, metabolomic characterization was carried out to identify the phytohormone IAA. All Sphingomonas isolates obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces were cultured in the presence of tryptophan, and metabolites extracted from the culture filtrate were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). The MS data analysis showed the presence of IAA among the metabolites extracted from all three strains, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 (Fig. 5A). The production of IAA (molecular weight, M = 175.18 g/mol) by these isolates was confirmed by comparing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) profile (positive mode: M+H = ∼176 g/mol) of IAA standard with culture extracts, either alone or mixed with IAA standard (Fig. 5A). The ESI-MS profile of all the three culture extracts was found to be comparable with the standard. Further, the production of IAA was validated by tandem mass spectrometry to generate a mass fragmentation profile in positive mode, corresponding to M+H of ∼176 g/mol. The three culture extracts resulted in a fragmentation pattern that was similar to the IAA standard, generating three different fragments, including a parent ion of ∼176 g/mol (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the presence of IAA was not observed in nutrient media without tryptophan (data not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data also revealed the presence of few other metabolites with molecular weights similar to those of other phytohormones; however, their positive identification will require further analysis, which is outside the scope of this study.

(B) LC-MS/MS spectrum of IAA standard compared to that produced by S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis flight isolates, all generating similar fragmentation patterns.Functional differences between ISS Sphingomonas isolates and their type strains. Analysis of plant growth-promoting features suggested the potential for conserved functional characteristics between the spaceflight and type strains of S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis genomes but with some distinctions. Therefore, functional differences were further explored through hierarchical clustering of the relative abundance of functional categories assigned by the eggNOG database (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, the selected Sphingomonas genomes clustered primarily according to the environment in which they were sampled (terrestrial type strains versus spaceflight-relevant surfaces at KSC and the ISS) and then clustered according to their species assignment. Examining the relative abundance of each of the assigned functional categories, it is clear that a sizeable portion (∼20% to 21%) of each of these selected Sphingomonas genomes lack known functional roles, highlighting novel gene products that are ripe for future bioinformatics and molecular characterization. Yet, differences in functional products corresponding to the category L, replication, recombination, and repair, are noticeably higher in genomes of the strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces. FIG 6. Open in a new tab Hierarchical clustering of the relative abundances for eggNOG functional categories for each of the selected Sphingomonas strains. Counts of each functional category were normalized to the total number of annotated proteins within each genome. The y-axis displays eggNOG functional category letter codes corresponding to the following: A, RNA processing and modification; B, chromatin structure and dynamics; C, energy production and conversion; D, cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning; E, amino acid transport and metabolism; F, nucleotide transport and metabolism; G, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; H, coenzyme transport and metabolism; I, lipid transport and metabolism; K, transcription; L, replication, recombination and repair; M, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; N, cell motility; O, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; P, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; Q, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; R, general function prediction only; S, function unknown; T, Signal transduction mechanisms; U, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; V, defense mechanisms; W, extracellular structures; Y, nuclear structure; Z, cytoskeleton.Protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains are shown in Fig. 7A and Table S1. Intersection analysis was performed using UpsetR for the presence and absence of named protein products across each genome (Fig. 7B). Here, 1,488 named proteins were shared among all of the selected spaceflight-relevant Sphingomonas genomes and their respective type strains. In contrast, 71 named orthologous proteins were unique to the S. paucimobilis strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and an analogous 53 named orthologous proteins were found to be unique to S. sanguinis spaceflight strains. However, a sizable portion of the proteomes for each of these genomes lacked predicted protein names to use as unique terms for intersection analysis. Thus, a custom pileup was performed that grouped entries into unique keys consisting of common predicted taxa, predicted protein names, the eggNOG free text description, and their predicted functional category where unnamed proteins could be compared across multiple genomes. While this method enhanced comparisons of unnamed protein groups identified by eggNOGv5, precaution should be taken when comparing the results, as different seed orthologs appear to transfer slightly different descriptions; however, such an analysis greatly improved functional insights that would not have been captured via analysis of KEGG Orthology (KO) or named proteins alone. Analysis of the KO assigned by eggNOGv5 revealed that gene clusters associated with rhamnose metabolism, type IV secretion (trb operon), conjugal transfer pilus assembly proteins (tra operon), and heavy metal resistance genes are present in each of the spaceflight S. sanguinis strains and are notably absent from the type strain S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T. While S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T is not a complete genome, the ability to capture the presence or components of large biosynthetic clusters or operons is conducive to the assemblies’ N50 of 61,922 bp across 134 contigs of total length 4,053,092 bp. Similar patterns of differences in type IV secretion apparatus, conjugal transfer proteins, and rhamnose metabolism were also observed for the spaceflight-relevant surface strains from S. paucimobilis compared to those of their type strains, albeit to a lesser extent than the patterns reported for S. sanguinis. Further unique gene products identified in S. paucimobilis include a suite of multidrug efflux proteins, DNA repair proteins (dinJ and sbcD), catechol metabolism (catABC), genes involved in quorum sensing via homoserine lactone synthesis and export, and the natural transformation protein comEA. Both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis spaceflight isolates also showed the presence of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of industrially important metabolites, including antibiotics (erythromycin and vancomycin) and anticancer compounds (betalains). Overall, our results point to functional differences in these spaceflight-relevant S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis genomes compared to their respective type strains, many of which may provide adaptive advantages for survival during spaceflight or on spaceflight-relevant surfaces.

The features involved in the plant growth promotion were identified based on comparative genomic analysis with a well-characterized endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11. Such comparative genomic analysis of the S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight genomes, along with their respective type strains, showed substantial genomic similarity to Sphingomonas sp. LK11, evidenced by high nucleotide identity and a large core genome shared among these bacteria. Leveraging extensive annotation provided by the eggNOG-MapperV2 software, PGPFs described previously for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (14) were largely consistent with the results of comparative analysis conducted in this study. While minor species-specific differences in sulfur assimilation and hydrogen sulfide production were identified in S. sanguinis, all genomes shared similar putative PGPFs. Specifically, genomic analysis highlighted the presence of several enzyme classes that participate in ROS metabolism which appear to be present in multiple copies across each of the selected Sphingomonas genomes. In addition, analysis of metabolic pathways of spaceflight Sphingomonas strains also suggested that each strain is likely capable of producing the carotenoids zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin. Zeaxanthin has been suggested to play a number of roles in both bacteria and plants, including photoprotection, detoxification of ROS, and resistance to ionizing radiation (32). Indeed, high levels of zeaxanthin production in the bacterium Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens were shown to promote resistance to ionizing, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide; however, resistance among the select Sphingomonas strains was weaker than that among P. zeaxanthinifaciens (33). Additionally, zeaxanthin also serves as a metabolic precursor for the formation of the plant phytohormone abscisic acid, prompting speculation that zeaxanthin-producing, plant-associated microbes may promote plant growth by supplying plant hosts with carotenoid derivatives such as zeaxanthin (34). Further evidence for producing plant-relevant metabolites that confer antioxidant activity was also supported by the identification of the otsA/B and treY/Z pathways in each of the spaceflight Sphingomonas strains, strongly suggesting that these bacteria produce the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose. These results are in agreement with the identification of the otsA/B and treY/Z pathways in Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (15), as well as with previous work demonstrating that soybean plants inoculated with Sphingomonas sp. LK11, with and without exogenous trehalose, improved plant growth and stress tolerance under drought stress conditions induced via polyethylene glycol treatment (27). Likewise, transgenic introduction of the Escherichia coli otsA/B pathway in rice plant recipients yielded enhanced plant resistance to abiotic stress (35). In addition to promoting abiotic stress resistance in plants, trehalose production likely serves as an antioxidant against oxidative stress in microbes, conferring resistance to hydrogen peroxide, and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids induced by ROS (36, 37). Due to its role as both an antioxidant and signaling molecule, trehalose production also elicits protective effects against sources of ionizing radiation (38–40). Overall, these results strongly suggest that gene products identified across these spaceflight Sphingomonas strains support a model proposed for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (a strain isolated from a desert plant), wherein excessive ROS produced by plant hosts is ameliorated through oxidative stress response pathways deployed by Sphingomonas strains, thereby increasing plant stress tolerance to abiotic environments (15). In addition, many of these ROS-metabolizing gene products discussed in the context of plant abiotic stress also contribute to increased resistance against ionizing radiation. Given evidence of oxidative stress responses deployed by microbial systems during spaceflight (41), and increased exposure to sources of ionizing radiation in extraterrestrial environments, we speculate that many of the discussed PGPFs likely present in spaceflight S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains may be advantageous to their survival in the spaceflight environment. Alongside several putative PGPFs, the genomic analysis suggested that IAA may be produced through three separate pathways in these organisms, albeit with some species-specific reactions. While all the space S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains shared annotations for the conversion of indole-3-acetonitrile into IAA via a putative nitrilase enzyme, the production of IAA from the oxidation of indole-3-acetaldehyde via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein was absent in the spaceflight S. sanguinis strains. Yet, all S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains may also produce indole-3-acetaldehyde from tryptamine, catalyzed by a monoamine oxidase enzyme. While functional analyses have proposed putative downstream reaction mechanisms to produce IAA, many of the upstream reaction pathways lack a well-characterized mechanism of action via known gene products or enzyme classes. Consistent with this study, not all genes involved in IAA biosynthesis were found in the genomes of S. panacis DCY99T and Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (5, 15), indicating that a novel pathway for IAA production in Sphingomonas strains is yet to be elucidated. Subsequent LC-MS analysis confirmed that each of the space S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis isolates produced IAA, however, only when their growth medium was supplemented with tryptophan. The results obtained agree with other studies that have reported the production of IAA in Sphingomonas strains but, again, only in the presence of tryptophan in growth media (5, 12). In addition to the role of zeaxanthin and other plant metabolites in providing tolerance to certain stress conditions, IAA has also been reported to regulate several stress-related genes in Escherichia coli via accumulation of DnaK chaperone and trehalose (42). Some other studies have also reported an increase in trehalose accumulation upon exposure to IAA and found those cells to be more resistant to cold shock (43, 44). The chaperone DnaK has also been shown to protect E. coli from oxidative damage by preventing protein aggregation (45). This observation indicates that the production of IAA by space Sphingomonas strains might indirectly contribute to stress tolerance in the associated plants via similar mechanisms. Future applications of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses under space or simulated microgravity conditions will likely be prudent for identifying patterns of metabolic flux in response to tryptophan supplementation, thereby elucidating potential mechanisms for IAA production in these bacteria. Prompted by differences in functional compositions between Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC, ISS, Shengzhou Rocket X), intersectional analysis of orthologous groups of spaceflight-relevant genomes against their type strains was performed. Analysis of KEGG-associated annotations provided by eggNOGv5 showed the presence of several genes in space-related Sphingomonas isolates that were not otherwise found in their respective type strains. S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates showed the presence of tra genes involved in pilus assembly and conjugal transfer (traF, trbC, traU, traW, trbI, traC, traV, traB, traK, traE, traL, and traH) and those involved in mating pair stabilization (traG and traN), which were absent in the type strain (46). Some groups have previously reported the occurrence of conjugal transfer in bacteria under microgravity conditions (47–49). Therefore, the presence of tra genes in S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates indicates the existence of conjugal transfer under space conditions that might also be responsible for acquiring genetic materials from related bacterial species. In addition, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 showed the presence of genes involved in quorum sensing: lasI (acyl-homoserine lactone synthase), acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) biosynthesis, and LuxR family transcriptional regulator. AHLs act as signaling molecules through which LuxR regulates the expression of a number of genes, some of which are potentially associated with virulence (50). AntiSMASH analysis of S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight isolate also showed the presence of a gene cluster (region 6.1; Fig. S1) involved in the synthesis of a homoserine lactone (Hserlactone). Further, KEGG analysis also showed the presence of some genes involved in the production of industrially important metabolites in the spaceflight isolates. For instance, both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis spaceflight isolates showed the presence of modules associated with the biosynthesis of antibiotics like erythromycin A/B and vancomycin, which were absent in the type strains. Another important pathway that was highlighted in these spaceflight isolates is the betalain biosynthesis pathway and the presence of gene 4,5-DOPA dioxygenase extradiol. The enzyme dioxygenase extradiol is involved in opening the cyclic ring of dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA), resulting in the formation of an unstable seco-DOPA that further rearranges to form betalamic acid, the structural unit of betalains (51). Betalains are known to be majorly produced by Caryophyllales plants (e.g., the red and yellow pigments found in beets) and some fungal species; however, one bacterial species, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, was recently reported to produce betalains (52). They are known to have antioxidant activity, are reported to be effective against some cancer cells, and also promote anti-inflammatory response (53–55). In addition, KEGG Orthology analysis indicated the presence of some genes in S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates that may have been acquired to help them survive the use of antibiotics, as noted by multiple studies of other microbial species on the ISS (26, 56–59). For instance, the mercury resistance operon present in some bacteria contains mostly three genes: merR (transcriptional regulator), merT (inner membrane mercury scavenging protein), and merP (periplasmic mercury scavenging protein) (60), which were also found in S. sanguinis spaceflight and type strains. In addition to these three genes, the spaceflight-relevant isolates also showed the presence of merB (alkylmercury lyase), merE (mercuric ion transport protein), and merD (MerR family transcriptional regulator, mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein), which are not present in all bacteria containing the operon. Previous studies have reported that several mer genes (merD and merE) were more likely to be encoded on plasmids or transposons and, therefore, can be transferred via horizontal gene transfer (61), which might also be the case for S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates. S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates also contained gene rcnA, belonging to nickel/cobalt transporter family protein. Conclusions. This study utilized comparative genomics and identified a plethora of factors in Sphingomonas present in spaceflight environments that may result in the production of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the phytohormones IAA was also confirmed using metabolomics. These space Sphingomonas strains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS (62), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system enabling future extended-duration crewed missions.MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis. Sample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of Sphingomonas strains, are described elsewhere (25, 63). Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies (25). In addition to cultivation, previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from  (26) and analyzed for the presence of Sphingomonas species, and MAGs were generated. DNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously (26). Identification of Sphingomonas spp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described elsewhere (59). In the case of S. sanguinis genome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection, processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously (26). The assembled draft genomes were annotated using  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11 (64, 65). The identity of the strains was confirmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud (66).Genome annotation. To further explore potential functional differences between spaceflight isolates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the  RefSeq database and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web server using the default settings (67, 68). The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome of S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the  GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequences for each Sphingomonas genome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-genome basis using a custom python script (available for use via https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceflight isolates highlighted potential connections to the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, a strain well characterized with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities (12, 15, 24, 27, 69). Given the presence of a thoroughly annotated and complete genome sequence (15), robust evidence for the production of the plant phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA (12, 15), and previous use as a model for novel plant-associated Sphingomonas genomes (5), Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to identify putative plant growth-promoting features in other Sphingomonas genomes. In this study, the endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, two S. sanguinis isolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and one S. sanguinis MAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, and S. paucimobilis LCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their respective type strains: S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T and S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T.Metabolite extraction and analysis. Previous reports have characterized the phytohormone production capability of several Sphingomonas species, including Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (11), S. panacis DCY99T (5), and S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 (14). While both S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 and Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were confirmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the definitive chemical pathway responsible for their production is yet to be elucidated (12, 14, 15). Therefore, the potential for the production of the auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains was examined. The space isolates (S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1) were streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/L l-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture filtrate, we pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidified using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable aliquot of the extract (10 μL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Stock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 μL of the dilution was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate of 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN)/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min, 100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min.Comparative functional analysis. Genome similarities between spaceflight Sphingomonas strains, their respective type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were visualized using BRIG version 0.95 with the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the reference genome (70). Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%). To address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type strains, custom Python and R scripts (https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook) were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis. Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identified in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices API (71). To identify protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to construct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software. Genes identified by eggNOG-MapperV2 for the S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates were pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN (72) and UpSetR (73) using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1.Pangenome analysis. Pangenome analysis of the Sphingomonas space isolates, their type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2 (74–76). Primary functional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inflation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). The ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage settings.Ethics approval and consent to participate.

    "title": "Genomic Characterization of the Titan-like Cell Producing Naganishia tulchinskyi, the First Novel Eukaryote Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8875396/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The genus Naganishia [1] was resurrected from Cryptococcus and emended to accommodate the albidus clade of Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota [2,3,4]. The genus Naganishia contains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank: N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. diffluens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae, and N. vishniacii [2,3,4]. However, the addition of N. floricola made the list a total of 20 Naganishia species, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the family Tremellomycetes were isolated [5], and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated [6]. Some of the Naganishia species that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica [4,7,8,9,10,11], also reported that the ISS Naganishia species might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition, Naganishia species were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water [12], soil [13], tree trunk [14], air [12], Alpine glaciers [15], cheese, cereals [16], and human specimens [12]. Members of the Cryptococcus species, from which Naganishia species have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis [17,18]. The morphological transformation of normal Cryptococcus cells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection) [19,20,21]. It was also reported that titanization was unique to the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under similar growth conditions [21]. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported in Cryptococcus terreus. The ISS Naganishia strains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions. One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novel Naganishia species isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology when Naganishia species were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5% CO2 and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identification of genetic determinants related to cold adaptation and radiation resistance in N. tulchinskyi. The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Naganishia strains (n = 4) using microscopy and taxonomic affiliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) phylogeny [2].",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sample Collection and Isolation of Microorganisms During the flight experiments of Microbial Tracking-1, several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from various ISS environmental locations. Previous publications had detailed sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms from the ISS [5]. Briefly, internal ISS surface samples were collected using polyester wipes and then transported to Earth for processing. Samples were collected just prior to departure (within 5 days) and stored at 4 °C in the ISS, transported in cold packs (~4 °C) from ISS to the Earth, hand delivered at Long Beach, California after splash down, which were then carried in ice packs (~4 °C) during ground transportation, before storing at JPL at 4 °C for further processing. Total number of days for sample storage time from sample collection to processing was ~7 days. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The materials associated with the sampling wipes were placed in 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 µg/mL; v/v), to isolate fungi [5,22]. Microbial colonies grown at 25 °C for 7 days were picked from the media plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, six yeast strains were tentatively assigned to the genus Cryptococcus, and subsequent WGS characterization revealed that two strains were identified as Papiliotrema laurentii, while four strains belonged to a yet to be described Naganishia species [6], making this species the first known novel eukaryote to be isolated from the ISS [6]. 2.2. Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses The WGS used for the analyses were previously generated and published [6]. The WGS raw data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 [23] for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 [24] genome assembler (k-mer size—32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. Genomic DNA sequences and predicted proteomes (where available) of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from , followed by comparative analyses. 2.3. Phylogenetic Analyses Among the 20 known Naganishia species,  had ITS sequences available for all the species except N. indica. The gene sequences of all available strains were retrieved from , except for the four ISS strains, which were derived from their WGS during this study. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) and MLST analyses (with the seven genes) were carried out with all available Naganishia species (n = 10). The individual gene sequences for all strains were first aligned separately using ClustalW, and for MLST, seven gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually, aligned using ClusatalW, and used to generate a Maximum Likelihood Tree using MEGA 7.0.26 [25]. 2.4. Morphological Characterization under Simulated Microgravity Conditions 2.4.1. Growth Conditions for Phenotypic Analyses under Different Conditions Naganishia sp. IF6SW-B1T was streaked on a Yeast extract- Peptone- Dextrose agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 1.5% agar) plate and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, colonies were resuspended in PBS, and the cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The cells were then inoculated at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/mL in synthetic dextrose (SD) broth. Replicates (n = 3) of each yeast strain were grown under each condition tested. The cells were inoculated in three conditions; (a) the first set was inoculated in 5 mL of liquid media in a tube, incubated at 30 °C, and shaken at 150 rpm; (b) the second set was inoculated in 5 mL liquid media and incubated on a rotating platform in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C; (c) the final set was grown in 10 mL of liquid media in a high aspect ratio vessels (HARV, Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and mounted onto a vertical rotating device (at 30 rpm) to simulate microgravity conditions, these were placed in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C. The CO2 level of ISS habitat is ~10× more (~4000 ppm) than at Earth conditions [5]. Additionally, Titan cells were observed under 5% CO2 level in C. neoformans [26]. Hence, morphological changes were characterized at this 5% CO2 level. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation via a flat, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane (Synthecon Inc.). The cultures were all incubated as described for 4 days, followed by cell pelleting for further analyses. The biochemical and physiological characterizations were characterized by employing BioLog Yeast plates, as described elsewhere [27]. Briefly, 4-days grown colonies in PDA plates were collected in sterile distilled water aseptically, and ~106 cells were transferred into the BioLog Yeast plates (BioLog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and incubated at 25 °C for 7 days. The change in coloration and oxidation/assimilation profiles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positive and negatives were scored in 7 days incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days incubation. Further incubation and observation after 30 days period of time did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7.2.4.2. Confocal Microscopy Yeast cell samples grown under the three conditions described above were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. These cells were gently pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 rpm, and cells were rinsed 3× with sterile PBS. Subsequent processing steps were carried out in the dark, where samples were covered with aluminum foil and protected from the light. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 µM Calcofluor White and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then rinsed and pelleted as previously mentioned but with distilled H2O. After the third rinse, samples were pelleted again, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 µM TO-PRO®-3 (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were further rinsed and pelleted, as previously mentioned, using distilled H2O. The resuspended samples were filtered through a 0.2 µM 25 mm Isopore Membrane Filter (GTBP) using a filter manifold. This membrane was removed, placed on a microscope slide, and a drop of antifade was added to the top. A coverslip was placed, and then, the edges were sealed. The samples were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope and an Alpha Plan-APOCHROMAT 63× lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast cell size and cell wall thickness were analyzed using ImageJ [28].2.4.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy Yeast cells grown under various conditions were preserved using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Following the concentration, cells were immersed in a chilled 4% PFA and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before the PFA was removed and washed in PBS buffer. Fixed cells were transferred into a 24-well plate, dehydrated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) series (50% to 100%), and stored at 4 °C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Samples were attached to SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12 nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was performed to examine cell wall thickness variations and analyze organelles’ differences between the different environmental stressors (CO2 and simulated microgravity) induced Titan-like cells and standard cells, grown under Earth gravity, with 5% CO2 and without CO2. For TEM, yeast cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for at least one hour at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing, samples were polymerized at 60 °C for 24–48 h in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. The grids were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate, followed by Reynold’s lead citrate. The sections were imaged using a Tecnai 12 120 kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data were recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA).2.4.5. Statistical Analyses All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Specifically, data was tested for normal distribution with the D’Agostino and Pearson normality test, followed by non-parametric ANOVA using a post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis analysis. 2.5. Survey of Genes and Proteins Involved in Resistance Genes and proteins involved in cold resistance from the closely related species N. vishniacii [29] were screened using tBLASTn and BLASTp (Table 1). Cold tolerance included genes involved in carotenoid synthesis: isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, farnesyltransferase, farnesyl pyrophosphatase synthetase, phytoene-beta carotene synthase, NADP-cytochrome P450 reductase; genes involved in mycosporine synthesis: 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase, catechol o-methyltransferase, and carbamoylphosphate synthase reported in Phaffia rhodozyma [30]; enzymes involved in the formation and degradation of trehalose: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase component TPS1 and TPS2, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, NTH1, and ATH1. Additionally, resistance related proteins for fungi were screened using sequences obtained from  by using ‘microgravity’ and ‘radioresistance’ keywords. Microgravity-related proteins included: Daughter-specific expression protein 1 and 2, GPI-anchored protein 24, Chain A Flocculation protein FLO1, Chain A and B Flocculin, and Chain A proteinase K. Radioresistance proteins including sequences from the DNA repair protein rad9. Table 1.

De Novo Genome Annotation Gene annotation on each of the six assemblies (four Naganishia tuchinskyi strains and two closely related species) was performed using MAKER [31]. MAKER identified repeats, aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and proteins to a genome, and produced ab initio gene predictions. A total of 74,830 available ESTs from closely related Naganishia species were downloaded from  (Table 2) and protein sequences from six strains were downloaded from UniProt [32]. Table 2.

UniProt (2021) [32]. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2021. Nucleic Acids Res 49, D480–d489.Firstly, de novo repeat identification and masking were performed using RepeatModeler [33]. Then, MAKER control files were generated (maker-CTL), and a first-round was run using the maker_opts.ctl control file. Data for the transcriptome assembly (EST), protein sequences (protein), and repeat annotations (rm_gff) was provided. Additionally, the model_org was set to ‘simple’ to annotate simple repeats, and inference predictions of genes directly from ESTs and protein homology were set (est2genome = 1, protein2genome = 1). Lastly, GFF and FASTA outputs were assembled together with GFF3toolkit [34]. Next, we predicted genes using the gene models generated with MAKER by training SNAP [35] and Augustus [36] using BUSCO [37]. For SNAP, we used models with an AED of 0.25 or better and a length of 50 or more amino acids. To train Augustus, we excised regions that contain mRNA annotations based on our initial MAKER run, with 1000 bp on each side, as described [38]. To run BUSCO, the Eukaryota set of conserved genes was used. The -m genome option was specified to provide regions that included more than just transcripts. The initial HMM model selected was Cryptococcus, which corresponded to the closest genus of Naganishia (augustus_species = cryptococcus). The long option was set to optimize self-training Augustus. Following the BUSCO run, the second round of MAKER was performed using the SNAP and Augustus models. For this purpose, FASTA sequence files were replaced with GFF files (est_gff, protein_gff, and rm_gff), and est2genome and protein2genome were switched to 0. The third run of MAKER was performed, and the gene models were evaluated by counting the number of gene models and the gene lengths after each round and running BUSCO using the transcript sequences (-m transcriptome). 2.7. Functional Annotation Predicted protein sequences generated by MAKER were analyzed using InterProScan v5.51–85.0 [56] with default parameters. Functional annotations assigned by InterProScan per protein sequence were converted into collections of Gene Ontology (GO) terms using BLAST2GO [57] with default parameters. All assigned GO terms per protein were aggregated and visualized using the REVIGO web tool [58] with the “tiny” similarity cutoff (0.4) searched against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C database and using the SimRel measurement of similarity. Visualizations were generated using the code provided by REVIGO and using R3.6.3. 2.8. Data Availability The WGS and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA623412 [6].

In addition to the WGS, we performed amplicon sequencing the ITS region from each strain [5], and their accession numbers are given below.

Results and Discussion Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia (Cryptococcus) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [5]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [59]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia. The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on  for Naganishia species (n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and cytochrome b (CYTB), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [2]. The respective gene sequences that were available on  for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes (Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 (AF145323.1), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 (AF444362.2), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 (AF444360.1), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 (AF145324.1), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S7. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure S3), whereas the other four genes (CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure S1) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis. ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711T (AF145325), N. liquefaciens CBS 968T (AF444345), and N. diffluens CBS 160T (AF145330). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320.), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure S1). In the LSU tree (Supplemental Figure S2), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii, and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502) (Supplemental Figure S2). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [1]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure S3) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens. Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes (Figure 1). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160T (Figure 1). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens. This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia. All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere [6]. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53–56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia. Figure 1.

Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under culture conditions similar to those used for titanization of C. neoformans, and analyzed using a variety of microscopy techniques. Cell size and cell wall thickness were determined using Calcofluor White stain (Figure 2), Titan-like cell morphology using SEM (Figure 3), and cell wall structure using TEM (Figure 4). The Calcofluor White Stain (Figure 2A) binds with chitin contained within cell walls, and once triggered by its excitation wavelength (380 nm), the stain fluoresces and emits blue light at 475 nm. Bright-field images were captured alongside Calcofluor White images to show cell distribution and confirm successful Calcofluor White staining, while Calcofluor White micrographs were used to measure the size of the cells and their thickness (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows the cell size in diameter (µm) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5 µm to 6 µm; however, the cells grown under 5% CO2 were statistically significantly larger (p ≤ 0.05). When the strain was grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, the cell size increased at least two to three times in size (4 µm to 13 µm; mean increased size of ~10 µm) and was statistically significantly larger than both the standard gravity control (p ≤ 0.0001) and the 5% CO2 treatment (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2B). There was no statistical difference for cell wall thickness between the standard gravity control and the 5% CO2 grow cells (ns). However, the cell wall thickness was two to three-times larger when cells were grown under simulated microgravity conditions compared with the other two culture conditions (0.55 µm and 0.40–0.39 µm, respectively), these findings were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Confocal microscope-based analyses of N. tulchinskyi cells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO2 (CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO2 (µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in (A). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images (B). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells (p value = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy (C). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size (p value ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported as p value > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****). p values of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD (A) and CO (B) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG (C,D) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow (D). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm.Figure 4. Open in a new tab Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD (A,B), CO (C,D), and µG (E,F) grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows (C). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for (A,C,E) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for (B,D,F) is 0.2 µm.The budding scars in IF6SW-B1T strain seemed to exhibit normal bipolar budding pattern when grown under standard gravity (Figure 3A) and when grown and exposed to 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity (Figure 3B). However, when the strain is grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions, multilateral budding is seen (Figure 3C,D). In addition, the budding cells were not as predominant under microgravity as those grown under normal gravity conditions (Figure 3A). Finally, when the IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under 5% CO2, as well as simulated microgravity (Figure 3C,D) conditions, observations of budding cells were much less commonly observed, whereas the budding scars were evident and appeared to take up a larger proportional area on the yeast cell surface. The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 2–3 µm raised prominences extending 1–2 µm from the cell surface to large flat raised rings up to 5 µm in diameter (Figure 3C,D). Despite these morphological differences, microgravity grown yeast cells were viable when re-streaked onto a PDA plate. Comparatively, the number of viable cells was less when grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity compared to the other standard atmosphere and gravity conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that the cells were defective in cytoskeleton formation, which might limit the formation of viable daughter cells. Cell wall structure analysis was then performed for the IF6SW-B1T strain using TEM data. A simple comparison of the cell wall thickness of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity (Figure 4A,B) with simulated microgravity (Figure 4E, F) conditions exhibited enormous size (~5×) differences and substantiated the confocal microscopy-based measurements. Comparison of confocal, SEM, and TEM (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4) between the three different conditions indicated that the µG grown Titan-like cells were much larger and exhibited irregular morphologies, including the novel discovery of peeling and shedding bud scars (Figure 3D, Figure 4E, and Figure S8A–G). Indeed, a large majority of the disfigurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred (Figure 3C,D and Figure S8A–C). Further analyses of TEM images emphasized the differences between the growth conditions, with µG grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated fimbria (Figure 4E,F). Fimbria have been shown to play roles in both biofilm formation [60] and pathogenesis [61]; thus, the modifications seen in µG grown cell fimbria could alter both biofilm formation and pathogenesis. The increased cell wall thickness of the µG grown cells could impart resistance to osmotic shock or add protection against radiation exposure. These structural alterations seen in TEM are a direct stress response to the microgravity and elevated CO2 conditions, and they could possibly serve to benefit (or hinder) the yeast cell’s survivability in the spaceflight environment. Additionally, the µG grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartments/structures (Figure 4E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles (Figure 4E) [62]. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances [62,63]. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells [64]. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity induced compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis [20,65]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [20]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1T yeast to space conditions [20]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system [21,26,65,66,67]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation (Table 1), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of  queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics (Table 1). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae. Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically important genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains [31]. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan [68] (Figure 5) and passed through REVIGO [58] to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms (Figure S1). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds (Supplemental Table S1). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function (Table S1), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation (Figure 5 and Figure S2). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis [20,69]. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi. However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function in N. tulchinskyi genome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [58].The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures [29] and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments [1] has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available [70,71]. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied [72], the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance [39], radiation tolerance [47], and microgravity (Table 1) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceflight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identified [73,74]. It has been reported that the RAD51, RAD54, and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage [47]. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation protection [75,76], all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans [77,78]. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, putative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae (Table 1). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efficiently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [79]. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, significance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed [80]. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase (pbs) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbs involvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood [81]. 3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K.

N.L. gen. n. tulchinskyi named after Igor Tulchinsky, an American Philanthropist supporting biomedical, computational, and space research). Diagnosis: Based on the morphological characteristics, strains IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1 are similar to N. albida group, but phylogenetically distant from all known Naganishia species. Hyphae and pseudohyphae were not present, sexual reproduction was not observed, budding cells were present and ballistoconidia were absent. Type strain: IF6SW-B1T. Holotype: USA: International Space Station surfaces, March 15, 2015. Nitin K. Singh and Kasthuri Venkateswaran, ex-type living culture (IF6SW-B1T) was preserved in a metabolically inactive state at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL 64202) and at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 113487). Description: In PDA medium after 5 days at 25 °C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 ± 0.97 μm and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30 °C, cells are ~3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells (Figure 2). After incubation at 25 °C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30 °C and not at 35 °C on nutrient medium. Biochemical characteristics: Differential biochemical characteristics of N. tulchinskyi with other closely related Naganishia species are shown in Table 3. N. tulchinskyi strains are able to assimilate D-Arabinose, D-Ribose, L-Sorbose, D-Mannitol, α-D-Glucose, L-Arabinose, Salicin, D-Trehalose, Maltose, D-Xylose, Sucrose, D-Cellobiose, Succinic Acid Mono-Methyl Ester, D-Xylose, and Palatinose as sole carbon source.

N. tulchinskyi cells assimilate D-arabinose and can be differentiated from N. friedmannii, N. saitoi, N. globosa. Similarly, several carbon substrates are differentially utilized by N. tulchinskyi and are detailed in Table 3. Table 3.

Abbreviation: “+” positive; “-” negative; “NT” not tested; “w” weak reaction; “v” variable reaction.Ecology/Substrate/Host: Distinct Naganishia yeast colonies (n = 4) were isolated over two separate sample collection flights from three different locations. The type strain IF6SW-B1T and two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1T was isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution: This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined: The particulate matter associated with 1 m2 surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined.",
    "discussion": "3. Results and Discussion Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia (Cryptococcus) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [5]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [59]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia. The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on  for Naganishia species (n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and cytochrome b (CYTB), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [2]. The respective gene sequences that were available on  for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes (Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 (AF145323.1), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 (AF444362.2), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 (AF444360.1), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 (AF145324.1), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S7. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure S3), whereas the other four genes (CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure S1) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis. ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711T (AF145325), N. liquefaciens CBS 968T (AF444345), and N. diffluens CBS 160T (AF145330). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320.), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure S1). In the LSU tree (Supplemental Figure S2), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii, and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502) (Supplemental Figure S2). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [1]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure S3) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens. Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes (Figure 1). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160T (Figure 1). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens. This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia. All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere [6]. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53–56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia. Figure 1.

Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under culture conditions similar to those used for titanization of C. neoformans, and analyzed using a variety of microscopy techniques. Cell size and cell wall thickness were determined using Calcofluor White stain (Figure 2), Titan-like cell morphology using SEM (Figure 3), and cell wall structure using TEM (Figure 4). The Calcofluor White Stain (Figure 2A) binds with chitin contained within cell walls, and once triggered by its excitation wavelength (380 nm), the stain fluoresces and emits blue light at 475 nm. Bright-field images were captured alongside Calcofluor White images to show cell distribution and confirm successful Calcofluor White staining, while Calcofluor White micrographs were used to measure the size of the cells and their thickness (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows the cell size in diameter (µm) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5 µm to 6 µm; however, the cells grown under 5% CO2 were statistically significantly larger (p ≤ 0.05). When the strain was grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, the cell size increased at least two to three times in size (4 µm to 13 µm; mean increased size of ~10 µm) and was statistically significantly larger than both the standard gravity control (p ≤ 0.0001) and the 5% CO2 treatment (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2B). There was no statistical difference for cell wall thickness between the standard gravity control and the 5% CO2 grow cells (ns). However, the cell wall thickness was two to three-times larger when cells were grown under simulated microgravity conditions compared with the other two culture conditions (0.55 µm and 0.40–0.39 µm, respectively), these findings were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Confocal microscope-based analyses of N. tulchinskyi cells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO2 (CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO2 (µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in (A). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images (B). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells (p value = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy (C). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size (p value ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported as p value > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****). p values of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD (A) and CO (B) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG (C,D) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow (D). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm.Figure 4. Open in a new tab Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD (A,B), CO (C,D), and µG (E,F) grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows (C). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for (A,C,E) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for (B,D,F) is 0.2 µm.The budding scars in IF6SW-B1T strain seemed to exhibit normal bipolar budding pattern when grown under standard gravity (Figure 3A) and when grown and exposed to 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity (Figure 3B). However, when the strain is grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions, multilateral budding is seen (Figure 3C,D). In addition, the budding cells were not as predominant under microgravity as those grown under normal gravity conditions (Figure 3A). Finally, when the IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under 5% CO2, as well as simulated microgravity (Figure 3C,D) conditions, observations of budding cells were much less commonly observed, whereas the budding scars were evident and appeared to take up a larger proportional area on the yeast cell surface. The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 2–3 µm raised prominences extending 1–2 µm from the cell surface to large flat raised rings up to 5 µm in diameter (Figure 3C,D). Despite these morphological differences, microgravity grown yeast cells were viable when re-streaked onto a PDA plate. Comparatively, the number of viable cells was less when grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity compared to the other standard atmosphere and gravity conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that the cells were defective in cytoskeleton formation, which might limit the formation of viable daughter cells. Cell wall structure analysis was then performed for the IF6SW-B1T strain using TEM data. A simple comparison of the cell wall thickness of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity (Figure 4A,B) with simulated microgravity (Figure 4E, F) conditions exhibited enormous size (~5×) differences and substantiated the confocal microscopy-based measurements. Comparison of confocal, SEM, and TEM (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4) between the three different conditions indicated that the µG grown Titan-like cells were much larger and exhibited irregular morphologies, including the novel discovery of peeling and shedding bud scars (Figure 3D, Figure 4E, and Figure S8A–G). Indeed, a large majority of the disfigurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred (Figure 3C,D and Figure S8A–C). Further analyses of TEM images emphasized the differences between the growth conditions, with µG grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated fimbria (Figure 4E,F). Fimbria have been shown to play roles in both biofilm formation [60] and pathogenesis [61]; thus, the modifications seen in µG grown cell fimbria could alter both biofilm formation and pathogenesis. The increased cell wall thickness of the µG grown cells could impart resistance to osmotic shock or add protection against radiation exposure. These structural alterations seen in TEM are a direct stress response to the microgravity and elevated CO2 conditions, and they could possibly serve to benefit (or hinder) the yeast cell’s survivability in the spaceflight environment. Additionally, the µG grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartments/structures (Figure 4E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles (Figure 4E) [62]. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances [62,63]. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells [64]. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity induced compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis [20,65]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [20]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1T yeast to space conditions [20]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system [21,26,65,66,67]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation (Table 1), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of  queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics (Table 1). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae. Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically important genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains [31]. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan [68] (Figure 5) and passed through REVIGO [58] to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms (Figure S1). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds (Supplemental Table S1). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function (Table S1), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation (Figure 5 and Figure S2). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis [20,69]. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi. However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function in N. tulchinskyi genome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [58].The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures [29] and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments [1] has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available [70,71]. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied [72], the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance [39], radiation tolerance [47], and microgravity (Table 1) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceflight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identified [73,74]. It has been reported that the RAD51, RAD54, and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage [47]. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation protection [75,76], all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans [77,78]. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, putative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae (Table 1). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efficiently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [79]. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, significance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed [80]. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase (pbs) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbs involvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood [81]. 3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K.

Holotype: USA: International Space Station surfaces, March 15, 2015. Nitin K. Singh and Kasthuri Venkateswaran, ex-type living culture (IF6SW-B1T) was preserved in a metabolically inactive state at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL 64202) and at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 113487). Description: In PDA medium after 5 days at 25 °C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 ± 0.97 μm and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30 °C, cells are ~3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells (Figure 2). After incubation at 25 °C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30 °C and not at 35 °C on nutrient medium.

Strain IF6SW-B1T was isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module).

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions In summary, a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization of N. tulchinskyi cells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reflecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.",

Copyright notice ID: 8875396 PMID: 35205919 Abstract Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Keywords: Naganisha tulchinskyi, yeast, International Space Station, phylogenetic analyses, Titan-like cells, simulated microgravity1. Introduction The genus Naganishia [1] was resurrected from Cryptococcus and emended to accommodate the albidus clade of Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota [2,3,4]. The genus Naganishia contains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank: N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. diffluens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae, and N. vishniacii [2,3,4]. However, the addition of N. floricola made the list a total of 20 Naganishia species, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the family Tremellomycetes were isolated [5], and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated [6]. Some of the Naganishia species that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica [4,7,8,9,10,11], also reported that the ISS Naganishia species might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition, Naganishia species were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water [12], soil [13], tree trunk [14], air [12], Alpine glaciers [15], cheese, cereals [16], and human specimens [12]. Members of the Cryptococcus species, from which Naganishia species have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis [17,18]. The morphological transformation of normal Cryptococcus cells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection) [19,20,21]. It was also reported that titanization was unique to the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under similar growth conditions [21]. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported in Cryptococcus terreus. The ISS Naganishia strains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions. One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novel Naganishia species isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology when Naganishia species were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5% CO2 and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identification of genetic determinants related to cold adaptation and radiation resistance in N. tulchinskyi. The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Naganishia strains (n = 4) using microscopy and taxonomic affiliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) phylogeny [2].2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sample Collection and Isolation of Microorganisms During the flight experiments of Microbial Tracking-1, several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from various ISS environmental locations. Previous publications had detailed sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms from the ISS [5]. Briefly, internal ISS surface samples were collected using polyester wipes and then transported to Earth for processing. Samples were collected just prior to departure (within 5 days) and stored at 4 °C in the ISS, transported in cold packs (~4 °C) from ISS to the Earth, hand delivered at Long Beach, California after splash down, which were then carried in ice packs (~4 °C) during ground transportation, before storing at JPL at 4 °C for further processing. Total number of days for sample storage time from sample collection to processing was ~7 days. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The materials associated with the sampling wipes were placed in 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 µg/mL; v/v), to isolate fungi [5,22]. Microbial colonies grown at 25 °C for 7 days were picked from the media plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, six yeast strains were tentatively assigned to the genus Cryptococcus, and subsequent WGS characterization revealed that two strains were identified as Papiliotrema laurentii, while four strains belonged to a yet to be described Naganishia species [6], making this species the first known novel eukaryote to be isolated from the ISS [6].2.2. Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses The WGS used for the analyses were previously generated and published [6]. The WGS raw data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 [23] for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 [24] genome assembler (k-mer size—32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. Genomic DNA sequences and predicted proteomes (where available) of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from , followed by comparative analyses.2.3. Phylogenetic Analyses Among the 20 known Naganishia species,  had ITS sequences available for all the species except N. indica. The gene sequences of all available strains were retrieved from , except for the four ISS strains, which were derived from their WGS during this study. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) and MLST analyses (with the seven genes) were carried out with all available Naganishia species (n = 10). The individual gene sequences for all strains were first aligned separately using ClustalW, and for MLST, seven gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually, aligned using ClusatalW, and used to generate a Maximum Likelihood Tree using MEGA 7.0.26 [25].2.4. Morphological Characterization under Simulated Microgravity Conditions 2.4.1. Growth Conditions for Phenotypic Analyses under Different Conditions Naganishia sp. IF6SW-B1T was streaked on a Yeast extract- Peptone- Dextrose agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 1.5% agar) plate and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, colonies were resuspended in PBS, and the cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The cells were then inoculated at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/mL in synthetic dextrose (SD) broth. Replicates (n = 3) of each yeast strain were grown under each condition tested. The cells were inoculated in three conditions; (a) the first set was inoculated in 5 mL of liquid media in a tube, incubated at 30 °C, and shaken at 150 rpm; (b) the second set was inoculated in 5 mL liquid media and incubated on a rotating platform in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C; (c) the final set was grown in 10 mL of liquid media in a high aspect ratio vessels (HARV, Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and mounted onto a vertical rotating device (at 30 rpm) to simulate microgravity conditions, these were placed in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C. The CO2 level of ISS habitat is ~10× more (~4000 ppm) than at Earth conditions [5]. Additionally, Titan cells were observed under 5% CO2 level in C. neoformans [26]. Hence, morphological changes were characterized at this 5% CO2 level. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation via a flat, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane (Synthecon Inc.). The cultures were all incubated as described for 4 days, followed by cell pelleting for further analyses. The biochemical and physiological characterizations were characterized by employing BioLog Yeast plates, as described elsewhere [27]. Briefly, 4-days grown colonies in PDA plates were collected in sterile distilled water aseptically, and ~106 cells were transferred into the BioLog Yeast plates (BioLog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and incubated at 25 °C for 7 days. The change in coloration and oxidation/assimilation profiles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positive and negatives were scored in 7 days incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days incubation. Further incubation and observation after 30 days period of time did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7.2.4.2. Confocal Microscopy Yeast cell samples grown under the three conditions described above were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. These cells were gently pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 rpm, and cells were rinsed 3× with sterile PBS. Subsequent processing steps were carried out in the dark, where samples were covered with aluminum foil and protected from the light. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 µM Calcofluor White and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then rinsed and pelleted as previously mentioned but with distilled H2O. After the third rinse, samples were pelleted again, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 µM TO-PRO®-3 (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were further rinsed and pelleted, as previously mentioned, using distilled H2O. The resuspended samples were filtered through a 0.2 µM 25 mm Isopore Membrane Filter (GTBP) using a filter manifold. This membrane was removed, placed on a microscope slide, and a drop of antifade was added to the top. A coverslip was placed, and then, the edges were sealed. The samples were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope and an Alpha Plan-APOCHROMAT 63× lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast cell size and cell wall thickness were analyzed using ImageJ [28].2.4.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy Yeast cells grown under various conditions were preserved using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Following the concentration, cells were immersed in a chilled 4% PFA and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before the PFA was removed and washed in PBS buffer. Fixed cells were transferred into a 24-well plate, dehydrated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) series (50% to 100%), and stored at 4 °C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Samples were attached to SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12 nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was performed to examine cell wall thickness variations and analyze organelles’ differences between the different environmental stressors (CO2 and simulated microgravity) induced Titan-like cells and standard cells, grown under Earth gravity, with 5% CO2 and without CO2. For TEM, yeast cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for at least one hour at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing, samples were polymerized at 60 °C for 24–48 h in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. The grids were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate, followed by Reynold’s lead citrate. The sections were imaged using a Tecnai 12 120 kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data were recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA).2.4.5. Statistical Analyses All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Specifically, data was tested for normal distribution with the D’Agostino and Pearson normality test, followed by non-parametric ANOVA using a post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis analysis.2.5. Survey of Genes and Proteins Involved in Resistance Genes and proteins involved in cold resistance from the closely related species N. vishniacii [29] were screened using tBLASTn and BLASTp (Table 1). Cold tolerance included genes involved in carotenoid synthesis: isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, farnesyltransferase, farnesyl pyrophosphatase synthetase, phytoene-beta carotene synthase, NADP-cytochrome P450 reductase; genes involved in mycosporine synthesis: 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase, catechol o-methyltransferase, and carbamoylphosphate synthase reported in Phaffia rhodozyma [30]; enzymes involved in the formation and degradation of trehalose: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase component TPS1 and TPS2, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, NTH1, and ATH1. Additionally, resistance related proteins for fungi were screened using sequences obtained from  by using ‘microgravity’ and ‘radioresistance’ keywords. Microgravity-related proteins included: Daughter-specific expression protein 1 and 2, GPI-anchored protein 24, Chain A Flocculation protein FLO1, Chain A and B Flocculin, and Chain A proteinase K. Radioresistance proteins including sequences from the DNA repair protein rad9. Table 1.

De Novo Genome Annotation Gene annotation on each of the six assemblies (four Naganishia tuchinskyi strains and two closely related species) was performed using MAKER [31]. MAKER identified repeats, aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and proteins to a genome, and produced ab initio gene predictions. A total of 74,830 available ESTs from closely related Naganishia species were downloaded from  (Table 2) and protein sequences from six strains were downloaded from UniProt [32]. Table 2.

UniProt (2021) [32]. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2021. Nucleic Acids Res 49, D480–d489.Firstly, de novo repeat identification and masking were performed using RepeatModeler [33]. Then, MAKER control files were generated (maker-CTL), and a first-round was run using the maker_opts.ctl control file. Data for the transcriptome assembly (EST), protein sequences (protein), and repeat annotations (rm_gff) was provided. Additionally, the model_org was set to ‘simple’ to annotate simple repeats, and inference predictions of genes directly from ESTs and protein homology were set (est2genome = 1, protein2genome = 1). Lastly, GFF and FASTA outputs were assembled together with GFF3toolkit [34]. Next, we predicted genes using the gene models generated with MAKER by training SNAP [35] and Augustus [36] using BUSCO [37]. For SNAP, we used models with an AED of 0.25 or better and a length of 50 or more amino acids. To train Augustus, we excised regions that contain mRNA annotations based on our initial MAKER run, with 1000 bp on each side, as described [38]. To run BUSCO, the Eukaryota set of conserved genes was used. The -m genome option was specified to provide regions that included more than just transcripts. The initial HMM model selected was Cryptococcus, which corresponded to the closest genus of Naganishia (augustus_species = cryptococcus). The long option was set to optimize self-training Augustus. Following the BUSCO run, the second round of MAKER was performed using the SNAP and Augustus models. For this purpose, FASTA sequence files were replaced with GFF files (est_gff, protein_gff, and rm_gff), and est2genome and protein2genome were switched to 0. The third run of MAKER was performed, and the gene models were evaluated by counting the number of gene models and the gene lengths after each round and running BUSCO using the transcript sequences (-m transcriptome).2.7. Functional Annotation Predicted protein sequences generated by MAKER were analyzed using InterProScan v5.51–85.0 [56] with default parameters. Functional annotations assigned by InterProScan per protein sequence were converted into collections of Gene Ontology (GO) terms using BLAST2GO [57] with default parameters. All assigned GO terms per protein were aggregated and visualized using the REVIGO web tool [58] with the “tiny” similarity cutoff (0.4) searched against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C database and using the SimRel measurement of similarity. Visualizations were generated using the code provided by REVIGO and using R3.6.3.2.8. Data Availability The WGS and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA623412 [6]. The genome sequences have also been deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GeneLab system (GLDS-290; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-290; accessed on 5 December 2021). In addition to the WGS, we performed amplicon sequencing the ITS region from each strain [5], and their accession numbers are given below. Naganishia IF6SW-B1 (KY218715.1); Naganishia IF1SW-F1 (KY218664.1); Naganishia IF7SW-B1 (KY218717.1); Naganishia IIF5SW-F1 (KY218695.1).3. Results and Discussion Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia (Cryptococcus) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [5]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [59]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia. The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on  for Naganishia species (n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and cytochrome b (CYTB), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [2]. The respective gene sequences that were available on  for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes (Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 (AF145323.1), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 (AF444362.2), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 (AF444360.1), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 (AF145324.1), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S7. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure S3), whereas the other four genes (CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure S1) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis. ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711T (AF145325), N. liquefaciens CBS 968T (AF444345), and N. diffluens CBS 160T (AF145330). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320.), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure S1). In the LSU tree (Supplemental Figure S2), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii, and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502) (Supplemental Figure S2). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [1]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure S3) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens. Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes (Figure 1). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160T (Figure 1). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens. This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia. All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere [6]. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53–56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia. Figure 1.

Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under culture conditions similar to those used for titanization of C. neoformans, and analyzed using a variety of microscopy techniques. Cell size and cell wall thickness were determined using Calcofluor White stain (Figure 2), Titan-like cell morphology using SEM (Figure 3), and cell wall structure using TEM (Figure 4). The Calcofluor White Stain (Figure 2A) binds with chitin contained within cell walls, and once triggered by its excitation wavelength (380 nm), the stain fluoresces and emits blue light at 475 nm. Bright-field images were captured alongside Calcofluor White images to show cell distribution and confirm successful Calcofluor White staining, while Calcofluor White micrographs were used to measure the size of the cells and their thickness (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows the cell size in diameter (µm) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5 µm to 6 µm; however, the cells grown under 5% CO2 were statistically significantly larger (p ≤ 0.05). When the strain was grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, the cell size increased at least two to three times in size (4 µm to 13 µm; mean increased size of ~10 µm) and was statistically significantly larger than both the standard gravity control (p ≤ 0.0001) and the 5% CO2 treatment (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2B). There was no statistical difference for cell wall thickness between the standard gravity control and the 5% CO2 grow cells (ns). However, the cell wall thickness was two to three-times larger when cells were grown under simulated microgravity conditions compared with the other two culture conditions (0.55 µm and 0.40–0.39 µm, respectively), these findings were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Confocal microscope-based analyses of N. tulchinskyi cells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO2 (CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO2 (µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in (A). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images (B). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells (p value = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy (C). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size (p value ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells (p value ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported as p value > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****). p values of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD (A) and CO (B) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG (C,D) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow (D). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm.Figure 4. Open in a new tab Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD (A,B), CO (C,D), and µG (E,F) grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows (C). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for (A,C,E) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for (B,D,F) is 0.2 µm.The budding scars in IF6SW-B1T strain seemed to exhibit normal bipolar budding pattern when grown under standard gravity (Figure 3A) and when grown and exposed to 5% CO2 with standard Earth gravity (Figure 3B). However, when the strain is grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions, multilateral budding is seen (Figure 3C,D). In addition, the budding cells were not as predominant under microgravity as those grown under normal gravity conditions (Figure 3A). Finally, when the IF6SW-B1T strain was grown under 5% CO2, as well as simulated microgravity (Figure 3C,D) conditions, observations of budding cells were much less commonly observed, whereas the budding scars were evident and appeared to take up a larger proportional area on the yeast cell surface. The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 2–3 µm raised prominences extending 1–2 µm from the cell surface to large flat raised rings up to 5 µm in diameter (Figure 3C,D). Despite these morphological differences, microgravity grown yeast cells were viable when re-streaked onto a PDA plate. Comparatively, the number of viable cells was less when grown under 5% CO2 and simulated microgravity compared to the other standard atmosphere and gravity conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that the cells were defective in cytoskeleton formation, which might limit the formation of viable daughter cells. Cell wall structure analysis was then performed for the IF6SW-B1T strain using TEM data. A simple comparison of the cell wall thickness of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity (Figure 4A,B) with simulated microgravity (Figure 4E, F) conditions exhibited enormous size (~5×) differences and substantiated the confocal microscopy-based measurements. Comparison of confocal, SEM, and TEM (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4) between the three different conditions indicated that the µG grown Titan-like cells were much larger and exhibited irregular morphologies, including the novel discovery of peeling and shedding bud scars (Figure 3D, Figure 4E, and Figure S8A–G). Indeed, a large majority of the disfigurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred (Figure 3C,D and Figure S8A–C). Further analyses of TEM images emphasized the differences between the growth conditions, with µG grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated fimbria (Figure 4E,F). Fimbria have been shown to play roles in both biofilm formation [60] and pathogenesis [61]; thus, the modifications seen in µG grown cell fimbria could alter both biofilm formation and pathogenesis. The increased cell wall thickness of the µG grown cells could impart resistance to osmotic shock or add protection against radiation exposure. These structural alterations seen in TEM are a direct stress response to the microgravity and elevated CO2 conditions, and they could possibly serve to benefit (or hinder) the yeast cell’s survivability in the spaceflight environment. Additionally, the µG grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartments/structures (Figure 4E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles (Figure 4E) [62]. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances [62,63]. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells [64]. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity induced compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis [20,65]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [20]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1T yeast to space conditions [20]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system [21,26,65,66,67]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect.3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation (Table 1), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of  queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics (Table 1). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae. Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically important genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains [31]. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan [68] (Figure 5) and passed through REVIGO [58] to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms (Figure S1). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds (Supplemental Table S1). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function (Table S1), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation (Figure 5 and Figure S2). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis [20,69]. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi. However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function in N. tulchinskyi genome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [58].The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures [29] and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments [1] has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available [70,71]. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied [72], the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance [39], radiation tolerance [47], and microgravity (Table 1) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceflight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identified [73,74]. It has been reported that the RAD51, RAD54, and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage [47]. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation protection [75,76], all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans [77,78]. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, putative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae (Table 1). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efficiently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [79]. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, significance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed [80]. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase (pbs) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbs involvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood [81].3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K. Singh and K. Venkateswaran, sp. nov. MycoBank number: MB838832. Etymology: Naganishia tulchinskyi (tul.chin. s’ky.i. N.L. gen. n. tulchinskyi named after Igor Tulchinsky, an American Philanthropist supporting biomedical, computational, and space research). Diagnosis: Based on the morphological characteristics, strains IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1 are similar to N. albida group, but phylogenetically distant from all known Naganishia species. Hyphae and pseudohyphae were not present, sexual reproduction was not observed, budding cells were present and ballistoconidia were absent. Type strain: IF6SW-B1T. Holotype: USA: International Space Station surfaces, March 15, 2015. Nitin K. Singh and Kasthuri Venkateswaran, ex-type living culture (IF6SW-B1T) was preserved in a metabolically inactive state at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL 64202) and at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 113487). Description: In PDA medium after 5 days at 25 °C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 ± 0.97 μm and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30 °C, cells are ~3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells (Figure 2). After incubation at 25 °C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30 °C and not at 35 °C on nutrient medium. Biochemical characteristics: Differential biochemical characteristics of N. tulchinskyi with other closely related Naganishia species are shown in Table 3. N. tulchinskyi strains are able to assimilate D-Arabinose, D-Ribose, L-Sorbose, D-Mannitol, α-D-Glucose, L-Arabinose, Salicin, D-Trehalose, Maltose, D-Xylose, Sucrose, D-Cellobiose, Succinic Acid Mono-Methyl Ester, D-Xylose, and Palatinose as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells did not utilize Cellobiose, Arbutin, D-Galactose, Glycerol, Hexadecane, L-Malic acid, L-Rhamnose, Lactose, Mannitol, Melezitose, Methyl a-glucoside, Myo-inositol, Raffinose, Xylitol, Citrate, Melibiose, Meso erythritol, Glucono D-lactone, Inulin, and N-acetyl D-glucosamine as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells assimilate D-arabinose and can be differentiated from N. friedmannii, N. saitoi, N. globosa. Similarly, several carbon substrates are differentially utilized by N. tulchinskyi and are detailed in Table 3. Table 3.

Abbreviation: “+” positive; “-” negative; “NT” not tested; “w” weak reaction; “v” variable reaction.Ecology/Substrate/Host: Distinct Naganishia yeast colonies (n = 4) were isolated over two separate sample collection flights from three different locations. The type strain IF6SW-B1T and two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1T was isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution: This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined: The particulate matter associated with 1 m2 surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined.4. Conclusions In summary, a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization of N. tulchinskyi cells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reflecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.Acknowledgments The research described in this manuscript was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA and the University of Southern California.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization.Results Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures.Conclusion Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.

    "results": "Results Data acquisition and genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction According to the data published by Singh et al. 2018 [15], among the PMA-treated samples, reads of K. pneumoniae were detected in a total of 11 sites—locations #1, #2, and #5 in Flight 1; location #5 in Flight 2; and locations #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7, and #8 in Flight 3 (Fig. 2). The relative abundances of microorganisms were calculated at the respective sites, and upon further pruning of this data to include solely those with >1% abundance, a total of 50 different strains of microorganisms that coexist with K. pneumoniae at varied locations and time points were chosen for further study. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Locations with a recorded viable presence of K. pneumoniae. The figure describes the locations of the ISS at which K. pneumoniae was detected from the respective PMA-treated samples, and also features its coexisting microorganisms that inhabit the location at >1% relative abundance. The networks have been drawn on Cytoscape for all three time points of the study by Singh et al. 2018: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The octagonal location nodes have been color coded according to the ISS Node they belong to. Locations #1, #2 and #3 belong to Node 3; locations #4 and #5 to Node 1; location #6 (not shown here) to PMM and location #7 to the US Laboratory. The microbial nodes have been color-coded such that those existing at more than one location with K. pneumoniae are shown in grey, implying that a microorganism found in a large number of locations (such as K. pneumoniae in F3) will be filled with a darker shade of greyAnalysis of the diversity of these microorganisms at each of these locations over time (Fig. 2) reveals the following trends. In Flight 1, among the three locations that were colonized by K. pneumoniae, there was an observed dominance of fungi in location #1, Enterobacteriaceae in location #3, and Erwiniaceae in location #5. In Flight 2, K. pneumoniae was documented to be present only in location #5, coexisting with extant and dominant Erwiniaceae, a member from the Enterobacteriaceae family and another from the Paenibacilleae family. In Flight 3 however, K. pneumoniae spread across the ISS, inhabiting nearly all sampled locations. Additionally, many more members of Erwiniaceae, specifically the Pantoea genus, emerged into view at a majority of these locations, as shown in Fig. 2. Further, with the exception of A. niger and Rhodoturula sp. strain JG-1b, all fungi considered in the dataset appear to be concentrated in location #3. Location #3 is also dominated by a large number of Staphylococcaceae. The list of microorganisms, along with their relative abundances at each location in each flight, is provided in Supplementary Table S4. Enterobacteriaceae are pivotal contributors to community metabolism Through a ‘leave-one-out’ approach, microorganisms were knocked out one at a time from the community to estimate the extent of benefit provided by that single microorganism to the remaining coexisting microorganisms. From the analysis, it was evident that some microorganisms do have an influence on the metabolic capabilities on the rest of the community, albeit low in most cases. Notable among these, were P. rubens at location #3 during Flight 3 (CSIA→A~ = 1.15%), and at locations #2 (CSIA→A~ = 0.40%) and #5 (CSIA→A~ = 0.36%) during Flight 1, and K. oxytoca at location #2 in Flight 1 (CSIA→A~ = 0.49%) (Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Figure S2). These low values of CSIA→A~ are expected, given the possible high metabolic overlap between members within a community, thereby rendering individual organisms less important to a community. To examine this, we grouped organisms based on their phylogenetic affiliation, and removed these groups, one at a time, from the community, to study the importance of a given family to the community. Overall, with respect to the locations considered in this study, the Enterobacteriaceae family comprising species of the Klebsiella, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Enterobacter genera, was often found to be the most beneficial of all clusters, with the highest CSIA→A~s in six out of a total eleven communities under study (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S6), five of which were in Flight 3. With regards to the remaining five communities, Trichocomaceae have the highest CSIA→A~s at locations #2 and #5 during Flight 1, Erwiniaceae have the highest CSIA→A~s at location #1 in Flight 3 and at location #5 during Flight 2, and Paenibacillaceae has the highest CSIA→A~ at location #2 in Flight 3. Here, A refers to the family of microorganisms that provides metabolic support. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Metabolic support provided by each family to the remaining community. The values on the tiles denote the Community Support Index (CSIA→A~) calculated in the presence of the family. The values are represented as percentages. The X-axis denotes the families present in the dataset, and the Y-axis denotes the respective locations. The heatmap has been facetted to indicate the three timepoints, i.e., Flights Pantoea species thrive in the support of the microbiome The CSIA~→Aof an individual microorganism in the presence of its coexisting microorganisms was calculated to gain insight into the combined effect of the community on an individual. The CSIA~→Avalues of Pantoea were found to be among the highest (Supplementary Table S7 and Fig. 4), indicating that these species are benefitted to a comparatively greater extent from the remaining members of the community. Across all locations and flights in the dataset, the CSIA~→A values of these species ranged between 0 and 6.52%, wherein the values at the lower end were predominantly observed in those Pantoea species found at location #1 in Flight 3. P. vagans was found to exhibit the highest dependency amongst all the Pantoea, at location #5 in Flight 2 (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Extent of metabolic benefit derived by an individual microorganism from its coexisting microorganisms. The heatmap depicts the range of Community Support Indices (CSIA~→A) that indicate the metabolic support rendered to an individual by virtue of it being in that location. The values are represented as percentages. On the X-axis is the list of microorganisms in consideration, and on the Y-axis is the flight number and the concerned location number. A darker red tile indicates the microorganism is benefitted to a greater extent in that flight and locationWith the exception of E. coli and S. enterica, the CSIA~→Avalues of other Enterobacteriaceae fell in the range of 0–0.91%, suggesting an overall lower dependence of members of the Enterobacteriaceae on their coexisting microorganisms (Fig. 4). K. pneumoniae showed no dependency (CSIA~→A = 0%) in six out of the 11 locations that they were found. In addition, S. enterica exhibited the highest community dependence amongst all microorganisms in consideration, with a CSIA~→A = 8.79% at location #3 during Flight 3, and along with E. coli, showed high CSIA~→A values (Fig. 4). Analysis across the three flights at location #5 reveals that four out of five organisms present at all instances are benefitted to a lesser extent in Flight 1 compared to Flights 2 and 3 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S7). K. pneumoniae are beneficial to its coexisting microorganisms In every community, microorganisms exchange metabolites, influencing one another’s growth and survival. We performed a pairwise analysis of a total of 761 flight-location-specific communities to identify how every pair of microorganisms interacts with one another, at a given location, during a given flight, and through various metabolic exchanges support each other. In communities with K. pneumoniae and a member outside of the Enterobacteriaceae, the MSI values in the presence of K. pneumoniae were found to fall in the range of 0–6.46%. Most Pantoea species were found to be highly dependent on K. pneumoniae, with MSIs at the higher end (4.41–6.46%) of the spectrum (Supplementary Table S8). With the exception of E. coli and S. enterica, the MSI values of all other Enterobacteriaceae members were found to be 0% in the presence of K. pneumoniae (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Out of 118 pairs, K. pneumoniae was found to have a non-zero MSI value in only nine such pairs. In these nine pairs, the other interacting member belonged to a species of the Penicillium genus. Since K. pneumoniae was present across the three flights only at location #5, the corresponding microbial association networks were constructed to gain insights into microbial interaction patterns over time (Fig. 5). In Flight 1, fungi such as P. rubens and Rhodotorula sp. JG-1b are prevalent and shown to decline in abundance over time (Flight 2 and Flight 3). On the contrary, members of the Panteoa genus were observed to dominate this location over time, with many more Pantoea species surfacing. In agreement with earlier results discussed, many species of the Enterobacteriaceae family shown here such as K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae, were beneficial to members of the Erwiniacea family to a great extent (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Microbial association networks for pairs of microorganisms inhabiting location 5, across the three flights. Cytoscape was used to construct and visualize these networks across three flights: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The nodes are labelled with microorganisms that inhabit the site at that respective time point. The directed edges are directed from the metabolically supportive microorganism to the metabolically dependent microorganism. The color of these directed edges are mapped to the Metabolic Support Indices (MSI), represented as percentages, such that the gradient from light blue to dark blue represents an increasing MSI Constraint-based modeling suggests the domination of amensalistic and parasitic interactions The graph-theoretic approaches described earlier do not explicitly account for the growth of microorganisms in the presence of one another or their rates, although a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community [30]. Complementary to the above approaches, constraint-based modeling approaches such as SteadyCom [31] can shed light on the ability of microorganisms to grow in a steady-state. Based on these predicted growth rates, it is also possible to classify the nature of the interaction between various pairs of microorganisms [37]. A total of 761 flight-location-specific pairs of microorganisms were studied. Among these, 458 pairs exhibited amensalism and 166 were predicted to be parasitism. Of the remaining, 48 were commensal, 36 were competitive, 34 were mutualistic and 19 were neutral. Looking closely into the nature of interactions of K. pneumoniae and its coexisting microorganisms, in 118 such pairs, 72 were predicted to be amensal, 14 commensal, 13 involved in competition, 10 were parasitic interactions, seven were mutual and two were neutral. In communities with the Enterobacter species, K. pneumoniae was involved in amensalistic interactions as observed across all such flight-location pairs. While in the interactions with E. cancerogenus and Enterobacter sp. strain NFIX59, the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was predicted to decrease, in the interactions with all other Enterobacter species, there was no significant effect on the predicted growth rate of K. pneumoniae. In eight out of nine flight-location-specific communities of K. pneumoniae with E. coli, E. coli was predicted to have no significant change in growth rate while that of K. pneumoniae was predicted to decrease, suggesting an amensalistic interaction. Further, in Flight 3, at location #3, E. coli was predicted to be parasitic towards K. pneumoniae. In the interactions with S. enterica, in four out of the six locations, the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was decreased in its presence, whereas that of S. enterica was increased, resulting in a parasitic interaction. This is in accordance with the previously observed high MSI values at locations #3, #5, #7, and #8 during Flight 3. In the other cases during Flight 1 at location #2 and Flight 3 at location #1, the interaction was predicted to be amensalistic, wherein the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was reduced. With other Klebsiella species, the interactions were predicted to be predominantly amensalistic, with the growth rate of K. pneumoniae reduced, except in the interaction with Klebsiella sp. strain MS 92-3, where the reverse was observed. K. pneumoniae was predicted to be parasitic towards K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1. The interactions with Pantoea species, such as P. agglomerans, P. conspicua, Pantoea sp. strain 3.5.1, Pantoea sp. strain A4, Pantoea sp. strain At-9b, Pantoea sp. strain FF5, Pantoea sp. strain NGS-ED-1003, Pantoea sp. strain OXWO6B1 and P. vagans, were amensalistic with a decreased growth rate of the Pantoea species, in all cases except in Flight 3 at location #1, where the interactions were predicted to be competitive. Interactions with P. ananatis however were found to be commensal, with an observed increased growth rate. P. dispersa and Pantoea sp. strain IMH were found to compete with K. pneumoniae at their coexisting locations (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S9). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Key interactions with Klebsiella pneumoniae. The network diagrams depict the nature of interactions pertaining to those of A Klebsiella pneumoniae with coexisting Pantoea species B Klebsiella pneumoniae with the coexisting fungi. The color and arrowheads of the edge indicate the nature of the observed interaction, and the edge labels correspond to the flight-location in which that type of interaction was observed. The nodes of K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P(2*) have been increased in size solely for the purpose of clarityStaphylococcus sp. in Flight 3 at location #2 were found to be mutualistic with K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P(2*), with the exception of S. saprophyticus that was observed to be involved in commensalism. During Flight 3, location #3 however, this interaction of S. saprophyticus with K. pneumoniae was predicted as mutualistic (Supplementary Table S9). This observed change in the nature of interactions may perhaps be attributed to the differences in the simulated medium compositions at the different locations. The interactions of K. pneumoniae with A. niger were observed to be parasitic, with an observed decreased growth rate of A. niger and an increased growth rate of K. pneumoniae. With Penicillium species, K. pneumoniae had an amensalistic effect on them, resulting in their decreased growth rates. The interactions with Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b were found to depend on the flight and location in which they coexisted. During Flight 1, at location #1, an increased growth rate was observed in Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b, whereas there was no significant effect on that of K. pneumoniae, thereby suggesting a commensal interaction. In locations #2 and #5, however, a neutral interaction was predicted, with no significant change in growth rates of either species. In Flight 3, K. pneumoniae was observed to be amensalistic towards Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b at location #1 and commensal at location #2. K. pneumoniae increased the growth rate of R. toruloides in Flight 1 at location #1 (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S9). Details regarding the nature of interactions of other microorganisms in the community have been delineated in Supplementary Table S9. Detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae on Aspergillus fumigatus The parasitic interactions of K. pneumoniae on A. niger were observed using various microscopic techniques (data not shown). Since A. niger is not a pathogenic bacterium, we extensively characterized an ISS isolated A. fumigatus, a BSL-2 bacterium, to understand the detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae. The scanning electron micrographs confirmed the parasitic effect of K. pneumoniae over A. fumigatus (Fig. 7). Under normal gravity conditions, A. fumigatus was found to be healthy where conidiophore holding vesicle with healthy metulae and phialides harboring conidia were noticed (Fig. 7A), whereas simulated microgravity affected the phialides structure (Fig. 7C) and subsequently conidia-forming cells were not clearly visible. When K. pneumoniae was co-cultured with the fungus, under normal gravity conditions, the bacterial cells (artificially colored in red) were shown to destroy the conidia-forming cells and also partially degraded metulae and phialides (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Antagonistic characteristics of K. pneumoniae when co-cultured with A. fumigatus under simulated microgravity. A A. fumigatus grown under normal gravity. B Both bacteria and fungus grown under normal gravity. C A. fumigatus grown under simulated gravity. D Both bacteria and fungus grown under simulated gravity. K. pneumoniae cells were artificially colored to show their presence on and around fungus culture. These pictures are representative of hundreds of SEM imagesFurthermore, when K. pneumoniae cells were grown with the fungus and incubated in simulated microgravity conditions, bacterial cells destroyed the fungal structure where only vesicle was seen along with the conidia and phialides, additionally the metulae were disformed and the hyphae (Fig. 7D) appeared to be disfigured compared to those seen in Fig. 7A or B. When co-cultured, the hyphae of A. fumigatus appeared to be healthy when grown under normal gravity (Fig. 7B) and mostly dead when exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D). The number of conidia were also less and on top of the conidia-forming cells the fungal morphological architecture changed. These changes were more obvious in microcosm where both K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus were co-cultured and exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D) than in the setup that were not exposed to simulated microgravity (Fig. 7B). Interpretation of image data was based on careful analysis of multiple images (n = 100), not only on a single micrograph of each test condition. Additional SEM images (n = 4 to 6) per condition are provided in Supplementary Figure S5A to S5D. The mixed nature of the microorganisms (bacteria/fungi), the high magnification necessary to resolve the smaller-sized bacterium (creating narrow field of view) and large morphology (mycelium, and conidiophore/conidia) of the fungus combined to prevent adequate SEM observations that would be necessary to reasonably quantify the cells. Thus, statistical analysis was not possible using the SEM approach. This visualization approach demonstrates that K. pneumoniae in combination with simulated microgravity negatively influenced the growth of the fungi. Both these bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from ISS and potential detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae as predicted by the metabolic model during this study was experimentally demonstrated, confirming the degeneration of A. fumigatus morphological architecture. In addition to these morphological modifications, K. pneumoniae also reduced the biofilm forming capability of the fungus when grown together (Supplementary Figure S6).",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we used a metabolic perspective to analyze the ISS microbiome with a focus on K. pneumoniae, a BSL-2 human pathogen, and its coexisting microorganisms. In our two-pronged approach, we first used a graph-theoretical approach to unravel the metabolic interdependencies in the microbiome, and we further complemented this with constraint-based analyses, to identify the consequences of microbial interactions on growth. We begin by looking at higher-order interactions in the community and further delve deeper and look at pairwise interactions that have been previously shown to be major drivers of community dynamics [41]. We traverse three taxonomic levels—family, genus and species and provide insights into the keystone species of the community through metabolic network analyses. The key results of this study are four-fold. First, among the families considered, species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial, among the ISS microbiome. Secondly, Pantoea species were predicted to be extensively dependent on their coexisting microorganisms. Third, through metabolic network analysis of microorganisms taken pairwise, K. pneumoniae was found to be beneficial to many of its coexisting microorganisms, especially to those species belonging to the Pantoea. Fourth, metabolic interactions in the community broadly fell under the categories of amensalism and parasitism. The parasitic interaction under normal and simulated microgravity between K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus was experimentally checked. Even though <7% of the metagenomic reads of ISS environmental surfaces constituted BSL-2 microorganisms, the dominant and persistent human microbial pathogens were Pantoea, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Erwinia and Penicillium [15]. Among the ISS surfaces, Zero-G Stowage Rack (Location #5) had more Pantoea reads compared to other locations of all flights. When metagenomic reads of all BSL-2 microorganisms were compiled, K. pneumoniae was found to be persistent and dominant in Zero-G Stowage Rack of all three flights (Fig. 2). In general, K. pneumoniae reads were more and dominant in all seven locations sampled in Flight 3. Unlike in Flight 3, K. pneumoniae reads were retrieved sparingly in Flight 1 (Cupola and WHC) and Flight 2 (Zero-G Stowage Rack). The cleaning reagent used in ISS consists of benzalkonium chloride, which might be able to eradicate the fungal population; thus fungal succession was not observed, unlike bacterial members which were persistent in the ISS locations examined [42]. It is also documented that K. pneumoniae cells were resistant to the quaternary ammonium compound concentration used as cleaning agents in ISS [43]. On applying graph-theoretical algorithms and surveying the microbiome at multiple levels, we predicted that among the families in the dataset, members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were perhaps the most beneficial to other microorganisms in the community, whereas in most cases, members of the families such as Erwiniaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Sporidiobolaceae (yeast) offered little or no additional metabolic benefit to the community. It has been documented that some Rhodotorula species produced silver nanoparticles containing antimicrobial properties against a wide variety of Gram-positive and negative microorganisms [44]. The members of the family Sporidiobolaceae (Rhodotorula, pink yeast) were isolated from the ISS locations [8], their antagonistic and parasitic behavior predicted during this study should be tested against opportunistic microbial pathogens to aid in the development of appropriate countermeasures. Similarly, the amensalism predicted towards Erwiniaceae and mutualism of Staphylococcaceae members with K. pneumoniae need further study utilizing the ISS strains. At the genus level, we observed that Pantoea genus typically derives the most benefit in the community. On looking at the pairwise interactions, we observed that amongst other Enterobacteriaceae, K. pneumoniae provides metabolic support to many of its coexisting species, notably those from the Pantoea genus. The members of the genus Pantoea were primarily considered as plant pathogens, but subsequently, they have been isolated from many aquatic and terrestrial environments, including ISS [8] as well as in association with insects, animals and humans [45–49]. During this study [8], the metagenomic sequences of the opportunistic human pathogens associated with Pantoea genus were P. agglomerans, P. conspicua, P. brenneri, P. ananatis and P. dispersa, whereas the plant pathogenic Pantoea species were not observed. The competitive metabolomic properties predicted during this study by K. pneumoniae with Pantoea members (Fig. 6A) might be due to the assimilation of similar compounds for sustaining their growth. Detailed phenotypic metabolic profiles of these microbes are needed to confirm the competition and amensalism predicted in this study. Finally, from the constraint-based analyses, many amensal and parasitic interactions were noticed. This is corroborated by earlier findings that K. pneumoniae can inhibit fungal conidia germination and hyphal growth, as well as biofilm formation of Aspergillus species [50]. Recent reports documented that K. pneumoniae shifted to a pathogenic state, potentially leading to septic infections when cooccurred with A. fumigatus in immunocompromised individuals [50]. In addition, this study shows that K. pneumoniae cells prevented germination of conidia and hyphal development of the fungi. It has been further shown that K. pneumoniae bacterial cells induced the fungal cell wall stress response mechanisms and suppressed the filamentous growth of fungi [50]. The simple in silico metabolic model of this study predicted the antagonistic (parasitic) metabolic interaction between K. pneumoniae and A. niger (Fig. 6B), which further enabled to validate parasitism in vivo, using the strains isolated from the ISS. However, this experimental evidence might not be enough to fully prove the metabolic prediction. Additional positive and negative controls are necessary, which would further improve the evidence of antagonistic metabolic interaction predicted during this study. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus growth are needed to validate the computational prediction of this study and warrants further study. Our study does have some limitations. First, the metabolic models used in the study are automated reconstructions, which despite gap-filling, could potentially contain gaps and blocked reactions and need to be curated [51]. Nevertheless, such automated reconstructions are being widely used in many studies as they serve as useful predictive tools and representations of the metabolism of microorganisms [52]. Secondly, wherever it is applicable, genomes generated from the cultured ISS microorganisms were utilized. Conversely, when strains were not isolated from the ISS environment, and thus, genomes were not available, the reference genomes of the corresponding type strains were used. However, reference genomes provide a useful perspective of an organism’s metabolic capabilities and have also been used in many other studies that incorporate metabolic models [53, 54]. In the absence of exact estimates of environmental metabolites, we posited that the environment had at least the minimal set of metabolites necessary for a given organism to survive, and also included additional cofactors and coenzymes. We assumed that each microorganism is capable of minimal independent growth and thus calculated the minimal medium required to support survival. It is possible that some of the interactions remain conserved, in richer media, although others may disappear, depending on the inherent metabolic capabilities of the organisms. The graph-based approach provides a somewhat static snapshot of the metabolic interactions happening between the organisms. Indeed, the graph-theoretic approach does not account for differential importance of reactions, or for example, the increase in growth rate, that may result from potential interactions. This is captured by the complementary constraint-based modeling approaches that were employed, and together, we believe, they provide a more complete picture of the possible interactions between the microbes. As previously highlighted in the ‘Methods’ section as well, there have been previous reports wherein a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community. As reported for Candida albicans, in addition to the genome-scale metabolic model, refining the model using phenotypic microarray and other wet-lab confirmation are needed [55]. Yet, it is highly useful and offers valuable insights into the potential microbial interactions in the community [30, 56] and well complements the constraint-based methods. Of course, it is important to emphasize that our computational methodology studies microbes through a metabolic lens only, and in reality, other interactions may be plausible. Nevertheless, metabolic interactions have been previously shown [21] to be important drivers of community structure and microbial interactions. Importantly, this study offers a first glimpse into the metabolic interactions of the ISS microbiome, upon which several hypotheses can be formulated for future experimental design.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion In summary, our analyses show the key role played by Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae in mediating the metabolic interactions taking place between microorganisms in the ISS. Metabolic modeling, through a combination of graph-theoretic approaches and steady-state constraint-based modeling, paints a more comprehensive picture of possible microbial interactions, which are as yet inscrutable to this extent by experimental approaches. Our results point towards key dependencies of microorganisms in various locations on the ISS and can pave the way for possible interventions that may rely on targeted disinfection of surfaces aboard the ISS. Our approach also underscores the importance of complementary modeling approaches in dissecting a fairly complex microbiome and understanding various possible interactions. Our methodology is fairly generic and can be readily extended to predict microbial interactions in other interesting milieu and generate testable hypotheses for wet lab experiments, as we have demonstrated in this study with Klebsiella and Aspergillus species.",

Copyright notice ID: 9258157 PMID: 35791019 Abstract Background Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization.Results Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures.Conclusion Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.

They form complex dynamic assemblages in every ecosystem, and their interactions shape the biotic and abiotic environments [1–3]. Beyond natural environments such as the soil or the ocean, microorganisms abound in all human habitats, where they directly impact human health [4]. The human-made International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and controlled system to study the interplay between the human microbiome and the microbiome of their habitats. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, yet it harbors many microorganisms that survive extreme environmental conditions such as microgravity, radiation and elevated CO2 levels [5–8]. Recent studies have demonstrated the unique link between crew member microbiomes and surface microbiomes on the ISS [9]. These microorganisms might have been brought into the ISS via routine payloads and astronauts [9]. Several studies have focused on microbial isolation [10] and molecular microbial community analyses of the ISS microbiome, through experiments performed on vacuum filter debris [11], high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters [12, 13], the ISS environmental surfaces [8, 14] and astronauts’ microbiome [9]. A recent report using a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach on intact cells of the ISS environmental microbiome revealed the succession and persistence of certain microbial populations on the ISS environmental surfaces [15]. The study posited a dominant, viable presence of Biosafety Level – 2 (BSL-2) pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella enterica (Figure S1). K. pneumoniae is well-known for its ability to cause pneumonia and other nosocomial infections and is largely studied for its known resistance to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, such as carbapenems, and its hypervirulence [16–20]. The present study is motivated by the evidence presented about the dominance of K. pneumoniae at multiple locations of the ISS, its succession over time [15], and the potential clinical implications it could have on the health of the astronauts inhabiting the ISS. Metabolic interactions are a key driver in shaping microbial communities [21]. Studying these metabolic interactions can be instrumental in understanding the interplay between various microorganisms in diverse communities [22–24]. Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a powerful tool to study and understand microbial metabolism [25]. These modeling approaches capture in detail, the known metabolic reactions happening in a microorganism, along with the enzymes that catalyze them, representing them in a mathematical form amenable to simulations [26]. Beyond single microorganisms, metabolic modeling can also be extended to study microbial communities; many paradigms have been developed, including those based on graph theory, and constraint-based modeling, as reviewed elsewhere [27, 28]. In this study, we leverage the metagenome datasets that have captured the microbial composition of the ISS surfaces [15] to specifically predict how various species in these communities can influence one another’s metabolism, leading to mutually beneficial interactions and stable microbiomes. In particular, we focus our study on K. pneumoniae and its coexisting species, to elucidate the possible underlying metabolic interactions that drive the structure of these communities. Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, MetQuest [29, 30], and a constraint-based community modeling approach, SteadyCom [31], we illustrate the central role of metabolic interactions and dependencies in shaping the ISS microbiome.Methodology In this study, a two-pronged computational approach was adopted to investigate and decipher the prevailing microbial interactions in the ISS. In the first graph-based approach [29], bipartite graphs were created to represent the metabolic networks of microorganisms taken individually, as well as when in pairs or larger communities. The metabolic networks underlying the organisms were represented as bipartite graphs, where two groups of nodes represent metabolites and reactions, and directed edges connect substrates to reactions and reactions to products. These networks were used to identify possible metabolic dependencies between different microorganisms. In the second constraint-based approach [31], microbial growth rates were predicted, individually and in communities, to gauge the nature of their interactions, as we describe in the following sections. Figure 1 shows a broad overview of the approach of this study, outlining the steps beginning with the identification of microorganisms coexisting with K. pneumoniae to various metabolic network analyses. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of the analysis pipeline. Beginning with identifying a list of microorganisms that coexist with K. pneumoniae, the genome-scale metabolic models were built using KBase and the extent of benefit derived by each individual microorganism in different scenarios was computed using MetQuest and the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) as a metric. SteadyCom, a constraint-based approach, was also employed here to determine the effect of a microorganism on the growth of another and to further classify the nature of their interactions into their respective types based on the observed change in growth ratesData Microbial abundances associated with samples taken across three flights at eight ISS locations were previously measured using metagenomic sequencing [15]. Among eight locations, only seven locations yielded measurable metagenomics data. In the present study, the data were further pruned such that only shotgun metagenome sequences associated with propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples that recorded a presence of K. pneumoniae were retained. The PMA-treatment removed naked DNA and dead cells, thus retaining sequences associated with viable and intact cells only [32]. Further, only microorganisms that were found to coexist with K. pneumoniae with >1% relative abundance at the location were used in this study. For this study, the available whole-genome sequences (WGS) of microorganisms from the ISS, which were compatible with KBase [33] along with reference genomes for the relevant microorganisms taken from the  database, were collected. The RefSeq and GenBank accession identification numbers, along with the underlying reasoning for the choice of these sequences, are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Although the relative abundance of Pantoea sp. PS2 was >1% in some of the locations considered in this study, as its reference genome sequence was removed from the  database, at the time of this study, this microorganism therefore had to be excluded. Metabolic models were constructed for the 52 microorganisms using ModelSEED [34]. The detailed process is elaborated in Supplementary Methods M1. The details of the reconstructions, templates and information about reaction counts are specified in Supplementary Table S2.Predicting metabolic dependencies in the community To investigate the microbial interactions underlying the chosen microbial communities of the ISS, MetQuest [29], a graph-theoretic algorithm was first employed. Through a novel dynamic-programming-based enumeration, MetQuest assembles reactions into pathways of a specified size producing a given target from a specified set of source molecules (‘seed'). Through a guided breadth-first search, MetQuest can identify all the metabolites that can be traversed from a set of seed metabolites. This functionality was exploited in this study as previously published [30]. Using this algorithm, the present study presents a top-down view of metabolic dependencies in these communities, beginning with predicting the most supportive families, then the most dependent genera, and finally the beneficial and dependent microorganisms by looking at pairs of potentially interacting microorganisms. In each scenario, the extent of benefit derived was calculated using a measure known as the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) [30]. This was also extended to measure the possible support an organism derives from (or provides to) a community where it is present, denoted Community Support Index (CSI). The composition of the seed metabolites was chosen so as to incorporate the co-factors and coenzymes that would be present in the environment and required by a living cell, and capture the minimal nutrient content offered by the ISS. The minimal medium of each metabolic model was identified by minimizing the components required to achieve a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h-1, using built-in functions in COBRApy [35], namely minimal_medium from the cobra.medium module. This approach was adopted on the premise that each microorganism is capable of individual growth. For each location at each flight, the minimal medium sets corresponding to each constituent microorganism were pooled together to form a consolidated medium. Additionally, a base set of co-factors and coenzymes were added to each of these sets. The same medium was used for both the graph-based and constraint-based analyses. Supplementary Table S3 contains the list of all such metabolites. Pairwise interactions For a pair of microorganisms, A and B, MSI is calculated as follows: MSIA|A∪B=1-nstuck,A∣A∪Bnstuck,A∣A 1 Here, nstuck, A ∣ A ∪ B refers to the number of stuck reactions in A, when present in the community alongside B, while nstuck, A ∣ A refers to the number of stuck reactions in A, when it is present in isolation. Individual bipartite graphs were constructed (n = 52), and the stuck reactions were first determined for every individual microorganism in the dataset, using the MetQuest algorithm as described above, which provided insight into the intrinsic metabolic capabilities of each individual microorganism. Following this, for every pair of coexisting microorganisms that may potentially interact, bipartite graphs were constructed for the two-member community (n = 426), and the stuck reactions were determined for each constituent member of each community, in a flight-location-specific approach (n = 761), to derive the effect of its partner by virtue of being in this community, through the calculation of the MSI. Building further on these interactions, as captured by the MSIs between various microbial pairs, microbial association networks were constructed and visualized using Cytoscape [36]. These networks capture the extent to which a microorganism is able to relieve the stuck reactions of another through metabolic exchanges.Higher-order interactions The enhancement of metabolic capabilities rendered by a microorganism(s) by virtue of it thriving in a community was derived from the MSI, here referred to as the community support index (CSI). The CSI, denoted CSIA→A~ throughout this manuscript, was calculated as the fraction of reactions relieved in the rest of the community over the reactions ‘stuck’ in the same in the presence of the microorganism. For a community X and an inhabitant microorganism, or family of microorganisms, A, the effect of A on the rest of the community A~ = (X − A), where A~ denotes the rest of the community X devoid of microorganism/family A, is computed as follows: CSIA~|X=1-nstuck,A~∣Xnstuck,A~∣A~ 2 Here, nstuck,A~∣A~ refers to the number of stuck reactions in the community X without microorganism A for the given set of seed metabolites. A reaction is considered stuck when it does not have the necessary precursors for the reaction to happen. In other words, these are reactions that cannot occur under the present conditions, without extraneous help in terms of other metabolites from other microorganism(s), or the environment itself. Similarly, nstuck,A~∣X refers to the number of reactions in A~ that remain stuck, even in the presence of A. We consider only internal reactions (as against transport or extracellular reactions) while computing these numbers. For each of the sites considered in this study, bipartite graphs were first constructed (n = 129) for communities devoid of one constituent microorganism, and their respective stuck reactions were determined in the appropriate environment (i.e., the seed metabolites described above and listed in Supplementary Table S3). This approach provided insight into the intrinsic metabolic capabilities of each community devoid of that microorganism. Following this, a total 11 bipartite graphs were constructed, taking into consideration all inhabitant microorganisms of a particular site. The stuck reactions were determined for each community to gather the effect of the interactions by calculating the CSIA→A~. A CSIA→A~ of unity indicates that A completely supports A~ and relieves all its stuck reactions, whereas a value of zero indicates that A has no effect on A~. Microorganisms could potentially be metabolically similar, and therefore redundant to the community, offering little or no metabolic support individually. Therefore, microbial interactions were also studied by grouping them by their respective families (n = 7), at each location. The metabolic support provided by groups of microorganisms (e.g., a family) can be readily computed by replacing A in X − A with the set of microorganisms comprising the family in Eq. (1). It is also possible to estimate the community benefit, in terms of enhancement of metabolic capabilities, an individual microorganism might receive by virtue of it thriving in a community. Here, the CSI, denoted CSIA~→A, was calculated as the fraction of reactions relieved in the microorganism when in a community assemblage over the reactions stuck in the individual. For a community X and an inhabitant microorganism A, the effect of the rest of the community A~ on A is computed as follows: CSIA|X=1-nstuck,A∣Xnstuck,A∣A 3 The CSIA~→A thus captures the ‘benefit’ a microorganism or a group of microorganisms receives from another microorganism or group, by virtue of its stuck reactions being relieved via metabolic exchanges with its coexisting microorganisms. For clarity, all CSIs and MSIs have been represented as percentages.Determining the nature of interactions Microbial interactions have major relevance in building and shaping the community. Based on the effects a microorganism has on another, the interactions can be categorized into six types, namely amensalism, commensalism, competition, neutralism, mutualism and parasitism [37]. The present study reports a constraint-based community modeling study using the algorithm, SteadyCom [31]. SteadyCom [31] was employed to determine the biomass production rates of all microorganisms that are a part of a community under steady state. The seed metabolites described earlier, in the network-based approach were used here as the medium (see Supplementary Table S3). The lower bounds of the exchange reactions for the uptake of these metabolites were constrained to −10 mmol/gDW-h [38]. Joint models were then created for all pairs of microorganisms that can potentially interact by virtue of being at the location at that point in time. These joint models were optimized using SteadyCom [31] to find the individual biomass rates when existing as a community. The growth rate observed for each microorganism in community was compared with that observed for the individual microorganism. A 10% or higher increase or decrease in growth rate, when in a community, was taken to be a significant effect [39]. The interactions were accordingly classified into the types listed above. The equation defined below was used to determine the effect of microorganism B on A, in a two-membered community constituting A and B. EffectofBonA=vbio,AB-vbio,Avbio,A 4 where vbio, AB is the community biomass production rate of AB and vbio, A is the biomass production rate of A. Depending on the value (positive [+], negative [−], or neutral [0]) obtained, the interaction was classified as mutualism (the effect of B on A, and the effect of A on B, both being positive, i.e., +, +), neutralism (effects on each other being not significant, denoted 0,0), competition (a negative effect on each other, denoted by −,−), amensalism (−,0 and 0,−), commensalism (0,+ and +,0), and parasitism (−,+ and +,−). K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus interactions Overnight grown cultures of K. pneumoniae (106 cells per 100 μL) and purified conidia of A. fumigatus (106 per 100 μL) were either mixed or grown alone in a 10-mL sterile potato extract (0.4%; w/v) dextrose (2%; w/v) liquid medium and grown under normal and simulated microgravity conditions using high aspect ratio vessel (HARV; Synthecon inc., Houston, TX) culturing units [40]. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation to the culture media via their large-diameter gas permeable membrane. The HARVs with microbes were incubated at 30 °C; 150 rpm, for 48 h. HARVs were run in parallel in both horizontal rotation (normal gravity control) and vertical rotation (simulated microgravity) orientation during growth. After growth, the bacterial and fungal cells were harvested, then fixed by incubating the cells in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate (Sigma) buffer at 4 °C for 1 h for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study. Samples were then washed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer three times. Fixed cells were then dehydrated in isopropyl alcohol (IPA, Sigma), using a stepped series of increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95 to 100%). Each step consisted of a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, followed by 3 x replacements with 100% IPA, and finally stored at 4 °C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD). Samples were attached in SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).Results Data acquisition and genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction According to the data published by Singh et al. 2018 [15], among the PMA-treated samples, reads of K. pneumoniae were detected in a total of 11 sites—locations #1, #2, and #5 in Flight 1; location #5 in Flight 2; and locations #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7, and #8 in Flight 3 (Fig. 2). The relative abundances of microorganisms were calculated at the respective sites, and upon further pruning of this data to include solely those with >1% abundance, a total of 50 different strains of microorganisms that coexist with K. pneumoniae at varied locations and time points were chosen for further study. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Locations with a recorded viable presence of K. pneumoniae. The figure describes the locations of the ISS at which K. pneumoniae was detected from the respective PMA-treated samples, and also features its coexisting microorganisms that inhabit the location at >1% relative abundance. The networks have been drawn on Cytoscape for all three time points of the study by Singh et al. 2018: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The octagonal location nodes have been color coded according to the ISS Node they belong to. Locations #1, #2 and #3 belong to Node 3; locations #4 and #5 to Node 1; location #6 (not shown here) to PMM and location #7 to the US Laboratory. The microbial nodes have been color-coded such that those existing at more than one location with K. pneumoniae are shown in grey, implying that a microorganism found in a large number of locations (such as K. pneumoniae in F3) will be filled with a darker shade of greyAnalysis of the diversity of these microorganisms at each of these locations over time (Fig. 2) reveals the following trends. In Flight 1, among the three locations that were colonized by K. pneumoniae, there was an observed dominance of fungi in location #1, Enterobacteriaceae in location #3, and Erwiniaceae in location #5. In Flight 2, K. pneumoniae was documented to be present only in location #5, coexisting with extant and dominant Erwiniaceae, a member from the Enterobacteriaceae family and another from the Paenibacilleae family. In Flight 3 however, K. pneumoniae spread across the ISS, inhabiting nearly all sampled locations. Additionally, many more members of Erwiniaceae, specifically the Pantoea genus, emerged into view at a majority of these locations, as shown in Fig. 2. Further, with the exception of A. niger and Rhodoturula sp. strain JG-1b, all fungi considered in the dataset appear to be concentrated in location #3. Location #3 is also dominated by a large number of Staphylococcaceae. The list of microorganisms, along with their relative abundances at each location in each flight, is provided in Supplementary Table S4. Enterobacteriaceae are pivotal contributors to community metabolism Through a ‘leave-one-out’ approach, microorganisms were knocked out one at a time from the community to estimate the extent of benefit provided by that single microorganism to the remaining coexisting microorganisms. From the analysis, it was evident that some microorganisms do have an influence on the metabolic capabilities on the rest of the community, albeit low in most cases. Notable among these, were P. rubens at location #3 during Flight 3 (CSIA→A~ = 1.15%), and at locations #2 (CSIA→A~ = 0.40%) and #5 (CSIA→A~ = 0.36%) during Flight 1, and K. oxytoca at location #2 in Flight 1 (CSIA→A~ = 0.49%) (Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Figure S2). These low values of CSIA→A~ are expected, given the possible high metabolic overlap between members within a community, thereby rendering individual organisms less important to a community. To examine this, we grouped organisms based on their phylogenetic affiliation, and removed these groups, one at a time, from the community, to study the importance of a given family to the community. Overall, with respect to the locations considered in this study, the Enterobacteriaceae family comprising species of the Klebsiella, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Enterobacter genera, was often found to be the most beneficial of all clusters, with the highest CSIA→A~s in six out of a total eleven communities under study (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S6), five of which were in Flight 3. With regards to the remaining five communities, Trichocomaceae have the highest CSIA→A~s at locations #2 and #5 during Flight 1, Erwiniaceae have the highest CSIA→A~s at location #1 in Flight 3 and at location #5 during Flight 2, and Paenibacillaceae has the highest CSIA→A~ at location #2 in Flight 3. Here, A refers to the family of microorganisms that provides metabolic support. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Metabolic support provided by each family to the remaining community. The values on the tiles denote the Community Support Index (CSIA→A~) calculated in the presence of the family. The values are represented as percentages. The X-axis denotes the families present in the dataset, and the Y-axis denotes the respective locations. The heatmap has been facetted to indicate the three timepoints, i.e., FlightsPantoea species thrive in the support of the microbiome The CSIA~→Aof an individual microorganism in the presence of its coexisting microorganisms was calculated to gain insight into the combined effect of the community on an individual. The CSIA~→Avalues of Pantoea were found to be among the highest (Supplementary Table S7 and Fig. 4), indicating that these species are benefitted to a comparatively greater extent from the remaining members of the community. Across all locations and flights in the dataset, the CSIA~→A values of these species ranged between 0 and 6.52%, wherein the values at the lower end were predominantly observed in those Pantoea species found at location #1 in Flight 3. P. vagans was found to exhibit the highest dependency amongst all the Pantoea, at location #5 in Flight 2 (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Extent of metabolic benefit derived by an individual microorganism from its coexisting microorganisms. The heatmap depicts the range of Community Support Indices (CSIA~→A) that indicate the metabolic support rendered to an individual by virtue of it being in that location. The values are represented as percentages. On the X-axis is the list of microorganisms in consideration, and on the Y-axis is the flight number and the concerned location number. A darker red tile indicates the microorganism is benefitted to a greater extent in that flight and locationWith the exception of E. coli and S. enterica, the CSIA~→Avalues of other Enterobacteriaceae fell in the range of 0–0.91%, suggesting an overall lower dependence of members of the Enterobacteriaceae on their coexisting microorganisms (Fig. 4). K. pneumoniae showed no dependency (CSIA~→A = 0%) in six out of the 11 locations that they were found. In addition, S. enterica exhibited the highest community dependence amongst all microorganisms in consideration, with a CSIA~→A = 8.79% at location #3 during Flight 3, and along with E. coli, showed high CSIA~→A values (Fig. 4). Analysis across the three flights at location #5 reveals that four out of five organisms present at all instances are benefitted to a lesser extent in Flight 1 compared to Flights 2 and 3 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S7). K. pneumoniae are beneficial to its coexisting microorganisms In every community, microorganisms exchange metabolites, influencing one another’s growth and survival. We performed a pairwise analysis of a total of 761 flight-location-specific communities to identify how every pair of microorganisms interacts with one another, at a given location, during a given flight, and through various metabolic exchanges support each other. In communities with K. pneumoniae and a member outside of the Enterobacteriaceae, the MSI values in the presence of K. pneumoniae were found to fall in the range of 0–6.46%. Most Pantoea species were found to be highly dependent on K. pneumoniae, with MSIs at the higher end (4.41–6.46%) of the spectrum (Supplementary Table S8). With the exception of E. coli and S. enterica, the MSI values of all other Enterobacteriaceae members were found to be 0% in the presence of K. pneumoniae (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Out of 118 pairs, K. pneumoniae was found to have a non-zero MSI value in only nine such pairs. In these nine pairs, the other interacting member belonged to a species of the Penicillium genus. Since K. pneumoniae was present across the three flights only at location #5, the corresponding microbial association networks were constructed to gain insights into microbial interaction patterns over time (Fig. 5). In Flight 1, fungi such as P. rubens and Rhodotorula sp. JG-1b are prevalent and shown to decline in abundance over time (Flight 2 and Flight 3). On the contrary, members of the Panteoa genus were observed to dominate this location over time, with many more Pantoea species surfacing. In agreement with earlier results discussed, many species of the Enterobacteriaceae family shown here such as K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae, were beneficial to members of the Erwiniacea family to a great extent (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Microbial association networks for pairs of microorganisms inhabiting location 5, across the three flights. Cytoscape was used to construct and visualize these networks across three flights: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The nodes are labelled with microorganisms that inhabit the site at that respective time point. The directed edges are directed from the metabolically supportive microorganism to the metabolically dependent microorganism. The color of these directed edges are mapped to the Metabolic Support Indices (MSI), represented as percentages, such that the gradient from light blue to dark blue represents an increasing MSIConstraint-based modeling suggests the domination of amensalistic and parasitic interactions The graph-theoretic approaches described earlier do not explicitly account for the growth of microorganisms in the presence of one another or their rates, although a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community [30]. Complementary to the above approaches, constraint-based modeling approaches such as SteadyCom [31] can shed light on the ability of microorganisms to grow in a steady-state. Based on these predicted growth rates, it is also possible to classify the nature of the interaction between various pairs of microorganisms [37]. A total of 761 flight-location-specific pairs of microorganisms were studied. Among these, 458 pairs exhibited amensalism and 166 were predicted to be parasitism. Of the remaining, 48 were commensal, 36 were competitive, 34 were mutualistic and 19 were neutral. Looking closely into the nature of interactions of K. pneumoniae and its coexisting microorganisms, in 118 such pairs, 72 were predicted to be amensal, 14 commensal, 13 involved in competition, 10 were parasitic interactions, seven were mutual and two were neutral. In communities with the Enterobacter species, K. pneumoniae was involved in amensalistic interactions as observed across all such flight-location pairs. While in the interactions with E. cancerogenus and Enterobacter sp. strain NFIX59, the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was predicted to decrease, in the interactions with all other Enterobacter species, there was no significant effect on the predicted growth rate of K. pneumoniae. In eight out of nine flight-location-specific communities of K. pneumoniae with E. coli, E. coli was predicted to have no significant change in growth rate while that of K. pneumoniae was predicted to decrease, suggesting an amensalistic interaction. Further, in Flight 3, at location #3, E. coli was predicted to be parasitic towards K. pneumoniae. In the interactions with S. enterica, in four out of the six locations, the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was decreased in its presence, whereas that of S. enterica was increased, resulting in a parasitic interaction. This is in accordance with the previously observed high MSI values at locations #3, #5, #7, and #8 during Flight 3. In the other cases during Flight 1 at location #2 and Flight 3 at location #1, the interaction was predicted to be amensalistic, wherein the growth rate of K. pneumoniae was reduced. With other Klebsiella species, the interactions were predicted to be predominantly amensalistic, with the growth rate of K. pneumoniae reduced, except in the interaction with Klebsiella sp. strain MS 92-3, where the reverse was observed. K. pneumoniae was predicted to be parasitic towards K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1. The interactions with Pantoea species, such as P. agglomerans, P. conspicua, Pantoea sp. strain 3.5.1, Pantoea sp. strain A4, Pantoea sp. strain At-9b, Pantoea sp. strain FF5, Pantoea sp. strain NGS-ED-1003, Pantoea sp. strain OXWO6B1 and P. vagans, were amensalistic with a decreased growth rate of the Pantoea species, in all cases except in Flight 3 at location #1, where the interactions were predicted to be competitive. Interactions with P. ananatis however were found to be commensal, with an observed increased growth rate. P. dispersa and Pantoea sp. strain IMH were found to compete with K. pneumoniae at their coexisting locations (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S9). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Key interactions with Klebsiella pneumoniae. The network diagrams depict the nature of interactions pertaining to those of A Klebsiella pneumoniae with coexisting Pantoea species B Klebsiella pneumoniae with the coexisting fungi. The color and arrowheads of the edge indicate the nature of the observed interaction, and the edge labels correspond to the flight-location in which that type of interaction was observed. The nodes of K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P(2*) have been increased in size solely for the purpose of clarityStaphylococcus sp. in Flight 3 at location #2 were found to be mutualistic with K. pneumoniae strain F3-2P(2*), with the exception of S. saprophyticus that was observed to be involved in commensalism. During Flight 3, location #3 however, this interaction of S. saprophyticus with K. pneumoniae was predicted as mutualistic (Supplementary Table S9). This observed change in the nature of interactions may perhaps be attributed to the differences in the simulated medium compositions at the different locations. The interactions of K. pneumoniae with A. niger were observed to be parasitic, with an observed decreased growth rate of A. niger and an increased growth rate of K. pneumoniae. With Penicillium species, K. pneumoniae had an amensalistic effect on them, resulting in their decreased growth rates. The interactions with Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b were found to depend on the flight and location in which they coexisted. During Flight 1, at location #1, an increased growth rate was observed in Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b, whereas there was no significant effect on that of K. pneumoniae, thereby suggesting a commensal interaction. In locations #2 and #5, however, a neutral interaction was predicted, with no significant change in growth rates of either species. In Flight 3, K. pneumoniae was observed to be amensalistic towards Rhodotorula sp. strain JG-1b at location #1 and commensal at location #2. K. pneumoniae increased the growth rate of R. toruloides in Flight 1 at location #1 (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S9). Details regarding the nature of interactions of other microorganisms in the community have been delineated in Supplementary Table S9.Detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae on Aspergillus fumigatus The parasitic interactions of K. pneumoniae on A. niger were observed using various microscopic techniques (data not shown). Since A. niger is not a pathogenic bacterium, we extensively characterized an ISS isolated A. fumigatus, a BSL-2 bacterium, to understand the detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae. The scanning electron micrographs confirmed the parasitic effect of K. pneumoniae over A. fumigatus (Fig. 7). Under normal gravity conditions, A. fumigatus was found to be healthy where conidiophore holding vesicle with healthy metulae and phialides harboring conidia were noticed (Fig. 7A), whereas simulated microgravity affected the phialides structure (Fig. 7C) and subsequently conidia-forming cells were not clearly visible. When K. pneumoniae was co-cultured with the fungus, under normal gravity conditions, the bacterial cells (artificially colored in red) were shown to destroy the conidia-forming cells and also partially degraded metulae and phialides (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Antagonistic characteristics of K. pneumoniae when co-cultured with A. fumigatus under simulated microgravity. A A. fumigatus grown under normal gravity. B Both bacteria and fungus grown under normal gravity. C A. fumigatus grown under simulated gravity. D Both bacteria and fungus grown under simulated gravity. K. pneumoniae cells were artificially colored to show their presence on and around fungus culture. These pictures are representative of hundreds of SEM imagesFurthermore, when K. pneumoniae cells were grown with the fungus and incubated in simulated microgravity conditions, bacterial cells destroyed the fungal structure where only vesicle was seen along with the conidia and phialides, additionally the metulae were disformed and the hyphae (Fig. 7D) appeared to be disfigured compared to those seen in Fig. 7A or B. When co-cultured, the hyphae of A. fumigatus appeared to be healthy when grown under normal gravity (Fig. 7B) and mostly dead when exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D). The number of conidia were also less and on top of the conidia-forming cells the fungal morphological architecture changed. These changes were more obvious in microcosm where both K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus were co-cultured and exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D) than in the setup that were not exposed to simulated microgravity (Fig. 7B). Interpretation of image data was based on careful analysis of multiple images (n = 100), not only on a single micrograph of each test condition. Additional SEM images (n = 4 to 6) per condition are provided in Supplementary Figure S5A to S5D. The mixed nature of the microorganisms (bacteria/fungi), the high magnification necessary to resolve the smaller-sized bacterium (creating narrow field of view) and large morphology (mycelium, and conidiophore/conidia) of the fungus combined to prevent adequate SEM observations that would be necessary to reasonably quantify the cells. Thus, statistical analysis was not possible using the SEM approach. This visualization approach demonstrates that K. pneumoniae in combination with simulated microgravity negatively influenced the growth of the fungi. Both these bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from ISS and potential detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae as predicted by the metabolic model during this study was experimentally demonstrated, confirming the degeneration of A. fumigatus morphological architecture. In addition to these morphological modifications, K. pneumoniae also reduced the biofilm forming capability of the fungus when grown together (Supplementary Figure S6).Discussion In this study, we used a metabolic perspective to analyze the ISS microbiome with a focus on K. pneumoniae, a BSL-2 human pathogen, and its coexisting microorganisms. In our two-pronged approach, we first used a graph-theoretical approach to unravel the metabolic interdependencies in the microbiome, and we further complemented this with constraint-based analyses, to identify the consequences of microbial interactions on growth. We begin by looking at higher-order interactions in the community and further delve deeper and look at pairwise interactions that have been previously shown to be major drivers of community dynamics [41]. We traverse three taxonomic levels—family, genus and species and provide insights into the keystone species of the community through metabolic network analyses. The key results of this study are four-fold. First, among the families considered, species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial, among the ISS microbiome. Secondly, Pantoea species were predicted to be extensively dependent on their coexisting microorganisms. Third, through metabolic network analysis of microorganisms taken pairwise, K. pneumoniae was found to be beneficial to many of its coexisting microorganisms, especially to those species belonging to the Pantoea. Fourth, metabolic interactions in the community broadly fell under the categories of amensalism and parasitism. The parasitic interaction under normal and simulated microgravity between K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus was experimentally checked. Even though <7% of the metagenomic reads of ISS environmental surfaces constituted BSL-2 microorganisms, the dominant and persistent human microbial pathogens were Pantoea, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Erwinia and Penicillium [15]. Among the ISS surfaces, Zero-G Stowage Rack (Location #5) had more Pantoea reads compared to other locations of all flights. When metagenomic reads of all BSL-2 microorganisms were compiled, K. pneumoniae was found to be persistent and dominant in Zero-G Stowage Rack of all three flights (Fig. 2). In general, K. pneumoniae reads were more and dominant in all seven locations sampled in Flight 3. Unlike in Flight 3, K. pneumoniae reads were retrieved sparingly in Flight 1 (Cupola and WHC) and Flight 2 (Zero-G Stowage Rack). The cleaning reagent used in ISS consists of benzalkonium chloride, which might be able to eradicate the fungal population; thus fungal succession was not observed, unlike bacterial members which were persistent in the ISS locations examined [42]. It is also documented that K. pneumoniae cells were resistant to the quaternary ammonium compound concentration used as cleaning agents in ISS [43]. On applying graph-theoretical algorithms and surveying the microbiome at multiple levels, we predicted that among the families in the dataset, members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were perhaps the most beneficial to other microorganisms in the community, whereas in most cases, members of the families such as Erwiniaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Sporidiobolaceae (yeast) offered little or no additional metabolic benefit to the community. It has been documented that some Rhodotorula species produced silver nanoparticles containing antimicrobial properties against a wide variety of Gram-positive and negative microorganisms [44]. The members of the family Sporidiobolaceae (Rhodotorula, pink yeast) were isolated from the ISS locations [8], their antagonistic and parasitic behavior predicted during this study should be tested against opportunistic microbial pathogens to aid in the development of appropriate countermeasures. Similarly, the amensalism predicted towards Erwiniaceae and mutualism of Staphylococcaceae members with K. pneumoniae need further study utilizing the ISS strains. At the genus level, we observed that Pantoea genus typically derives the most benefit in the community. On looking at the pairwise interactions, we observed that amongst other Enterobacteriaceae, K. pneumoniae provides metabolic support to many of its coexisting species, notably those from the Pantoea genus. The members of the genus Pantoea were primarily considered as plant pathogens, but subsequently, they have been isolated from many aquatic and terrestrial environments, including ISS [8] as well as in association with insects, animals and humans [45–49]. During this study [8], the metagenomic sequences of the opportunistic human pathogens associated with Pantoea genus were P. agglomerans, P. conspicua, P. brenneri, P. ananatis and P. dispersa, whereas the plant pathogenic Pantoea species were not observed. The competitive metabolomic properties predicted during this study by K. pneumoniae with Pantoea members (Fig. 6A) might be due to the assimilation of similar compounds for sustaining their growth. Detailed phenotypic metabolic profiles of these microbes are needed to confirm the competition and amensalism predicted in this study. Finally, from the constraint-based analyses, many amensal and parasitic interactions were noticed. This is corroborated by earlier findings that K. pneumoniae can inhibit fungal conidia germination and hyphal growth, as well as biofilm formation of Aspergillus species [50]. Recent reports documented that K. pneumoniae shifted to a pathogenic state, potentially leading to septic infections when cooccurred with A. fumigatus in immunocompromised individuals [50]. In addition, this study shows that K. pneumoniae cells prevented germination of conidia and hyphal development of the fungi. It has been further shown that K. pneumoniae bacterial cells induced the fungal cell wall stress response mechanisms and suppressed the filamentous growth of fungi [50]. The simple in silico metabolic model of this study predicted the antagonistic (parasitic) metabolic interaction between K. pneumoniae and A. niger (Fig. 6B), which further enabled to validate parasitism in vivo, using the strains isolated from the ISS. However, this experimental evidence might not be enough to fully prove the metabolic prediction. Additional positive and negative controls are necessary, which would further improve the evidence of antagonistic metabolic interaction predicted during this study. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus growth are needed to validate the computational prediction of this study and warrants further study. Our study does have some limitations. First, the metabolic models used in the study are automated reconstructions, which despite gap-filling, could potentially contain gaps and blocked reactions and need to be curated [51]. Nevertheless, such automated reconstructions are being widely used in many studies as they serve as useful predictive tools and representations of the metabolism of microorganisms [52]. Secondly, wherever it is applicable, genomes generated from the cultured ISS microorganisms were utilized. Conversely, when strains were not isolated from the ISS environment, and thus, genomes were not available, the reference genomes of the corresponding type strains were used. However, reference genomes provide a useful perspective of an organism’s metabolic capabilities and have also been used in many other studies that incorporate metabolic models [53, 54]. In the absence of exact estimates of environmental metabolites, we posited that the environment had at least the minimal set of metabolites necessary for a given organism to survive, and also included additional cofactors and coenzymes. We assumed that each microorganism is capable of minimal independent growth and thus calculated the minimal medium required to support survival. It is possible that some of the interactions remain conserved, in richer media, although others may disappear, depending on the inherent metabolic capabilities of the organisms. The graph-based approach provides a somewhat static snapshot of the metabolic interactions happening between the organisms. Indeed, the graph-theoretic approach does not account for differential importance of reactions, or for example, the increase in growth rate, that may result from potential interactions. This is captured by the complementary constraint-based modeling approaches that were employed, and together, we believe, they provide a more complete picture of the possible interactions between the microbes. As previously highlighted in the ‘Methods’ section as well, there have been previous reports wherein a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community. As reported for Candida albicans, in addition to the genome-scale metabolic model, refining the model using phenotypic microarray and other wet-lab confirmation are needed [55]. Yet, it is highly useful and offers valuable insights into the potential microbial interactions in the community [30, 56] and well complements the constraint-based methods. Of course, it is important to emphasize that our computational methodology studies microbes through a metabolic lens only, and in reality, other interactions may be plausible. Nevertheless, metabolic interactions have been previously shown [21] to be important drivers of community structure and microbial interactions. Importantly, this study offers a first glimpse into the metabolic interactions of the ISS microbiome, upon which several hypotheses can be formulated for future experimental design.Conclusion In summary, our analyses show the key role played by Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae in mediating the metabolic interactions taking place between microorganisms in the ISS. Metabolic modeling, through a combination of graph-theoretic approaches and steady-state constraint-based modeling, paints a more comprehensive picture of possible microbial interactions, which are as yet inscrutable to this extent by experimental approaches. Our results point towards key dependencies of microorganisms in various locations on the ISS and can pave the way for possible interventions that may rely on targeted disinfection of surfaces aboard the ISS. Our approach also underscores the importance of complementary modeling approaches in dissecting a fairly complex microbiome and understanding various possible interactions. Our methodology is fairly generic and can be readily extended to predict microbial interactions in other interesting milieu and generate testable hypotheses for wet lab experiments, as we have demonstrated in this study with Klebsiella and Aspergillus species.Supplementary Information 40168_2022_1279_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (144.2KB, pdf) Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods M1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Counts of cultivable bacteria and fungi from food items, water samples, and surfaces are a traditional mainstay for public health standards and assessment, as well as the core method that NASA uses to ensure that any craft or robot launched into space meets planetary protection regulations [1]. Preparing, plating, incubating, and counting samples using traditional agar plates, however, generates a great deal of plastic and organic waste and can be prohibitive in terms of the time and space required. Obtaining cultivable microbial counts from low-biomass arenas, including pure water samples, hospitals, clean rooms, and space habitats such as the International Space Station (ISS), presents additional challenges. The samples from these environments are often below detection limits when using standard plating methodology and dilutions [2,3,4], requiring larger numbers and volumes of samples to characterize microbial bioburden [5]. During a survey of multiple NASA clean rooms, for example, more than 30% of samples were below the detection limit for measuring the number of cultivable microbes [6]. In addition, the whole-genome sequencing of isolated fungi and bacteria from cultivable approaches is often necessary for further phenotypic and genomic characterization, which can be used to understand the functional and physiological traits of cultivable microorganisms. For example, isolates from hospitals and human habitats are often assessed for changes or increases in virulence and antibiotic resistance, e.g., [7,8,9]. Similarly, the NASA community is in need of understanding the yet-to-be cultured microorganisms for their possible survival or proliferation in extraterrestrial conditions [10,11,12,13]. Therefore, any improvements or changes in plating methods must not only produce cultivable microbial counts comparable to traditional methods but must also not change the ratios or types of the isolated species. For the last 50 years, miniaturized stackable media called “film” media have been available as alternatives to traditional agar [14]. Petrifilm was developed by 3M in the 1980s as an alternative to agar spread and pour plates. It consists of a thin wafer of nutrient/gelling agent between two plastic films. Petrifilm was designed to plate 1 mL of a sample on a surface with the approximate size and volume of a playing card, using dyes such as tetrazolium to indicate colony growth [15]. This greatly reduces both the volume of incubator space needed to grow a large number of samples and the time and materials needed to prepare agar plates. According to 3M, Petrifilm media “take up 85% less space, reduce waste 66%, greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, and water waste by 79%” compared with agar plates [15]. Recently, Kikkoman/Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) has developed another brand of film media, Easy Plates, which are similar to Petrifilm in many respects but which have the advantage of a hydrophobic resin ring surrounding the medium which negates the use of a spreader tool, reducing preparation time even further. In addition, the Easy Plate design purportedly increases the ease of counting by its reduced liquefaction of the gel compared with Petrifilm [16]. Previous reports on Petrifilm media found that they produced statistically similar results for cultivable microbial counts to those of agar plate methods for food and environmental safety testing, including aerobic bacteria in raw milk [17], poultry [18], fungal counts on dairy products [19], food items spiked with a variety of common molds [20], and aerobic or coliform bacteria in wastewater [21]. More recent studies showed that film media obtained equivalent counts to agar for soil samples inoculated with varying concentrations of E. coli [22], steel and porcelain surfaces inoculated with ubiquitous built-environment bacteria [23], biofilm samples using drop plating [24], and bacterial counts on a variety of food items [25]. There has also been extensive testing of film media in the dairy industry which is leading to the adoption of Petrifilm as a standard method for the enumeration of aerobic and coliform bacteria [26,27,28,29]. Petrifilm is now becoming a widely used method of bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counting and isolation in place of agar media [29,30]. Most studies testing film vs. agar media performance for cultivable microbial counts have focused on high-bioburden environments and samples such as dairy products and food, or samples/surfaces that are pre-inoculated with a known microbial consortium. Film media are only recently being assessed for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms and hospitals [31,32,33]. Recently, researchers from NASA compared Petrifilm Rapid Aerobic Count (RAC) plates with tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates for measuring the bioburden of an extremely low-biomass clean room environment and found that Petrifilm was equal to TSA plates in aerobic bacterial estimation [31]. In addition, Petrifilm was found to be superior to TSA in containing colonies that could spread and grow to cover 25% or more area of agar plate [31]. Kikkoman’s Easy Plates have not yet been compared in the scientific literature for their performance relative to both agar plates and Petrifilm. While film media have been previously used in place of agar plating to assess cultivable microbial counts for built environments and hospitals [30], they have not been tested in extremely low-biomass environments, particularly those with high fiber counts. Additionally, because Easy Plates entirely rely on water adhesion/cohesion forces for inoculation rather than manual spreading, it is likely that they could be viable options for environmental monitoring in micro- or low-gravity settings in future space installations. Therefore, our objectives for this study were to (1) test the bacterial enumeration performance among agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates for a variety of food items; (2) compare the cultivable microbial counts in an Earth-built-environment setting for agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates using bacterial- and fungal-specific media; and (3) test the efficacy of Easy Plates as an alternative method for bacterial and fungal bioburden estimation and the isolation of bacterial and fungal strains for surface samples from the ISS, for both cultivable microbial counts and species composition of isolates.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Descriptions of Petrifilm and Easy Plate Media Tested According to the manufacturer’s instruction manuals, Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) Plate [15] (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat# 6400) and Easy Plate AC [16] (Kikkoman, Noda, Chiba, Japan, Cat# 61973) were used for the enumeration of aerobic bacteria, and Petrifilm Rapid Yeast and Mold Count (RYM) Plate (3M, Cat# 6475) and Easy Plate YM-R (Kikkoman, Cat# 61977) were used for the enumeration of yeast and mold in the food and beverage industries. In general, in food and beverage microbiological testing, both the Petrifilm AC and Easy Plate AC count red colonies after 48 h of incubation at 35 °C. Petrifilm RYM counts blue-green colonies after 48 h of incubation at 25 °C or 28 °C, and Easy Plate YM-R counts purple colonies after 48 h at 25 °C. Both media can extend the incubation time up to 3–7 days if the colonies appear faint. 2.2. Food-Item Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing Food items (n = 63), including raw and cooked meats, vegetables, nuts, and processed foods (see Supplementary Table S1 for list), were homogenized with 90 mL (10 g samples) or 225 mL (25 g samples) of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed. One milliliter of each dilution was inoculated into each medium (Plate Count Agar, Petrifilm AC, and Easy Plate AC), incubated for 48 h at 35 °C, which are standard FDA methods for food safety testing [34], and the number of bacteria was counted. Fungal counts were not assayed for food samples. 2.3. Built-Environment Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing The surfaces of Japanese homes (n = 5) were sampled for bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counts. At each home, three different surfaces were sampled: one expected low-bioburden (example: window glass), one expected medium-bioburden, and one expected high-bioburden (example: living room floor) sample. Pro-media ST-25 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab kits from ELMEX LIMITED (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan), consisting of a cotton swab in 10 mL of sterile PBS, were used to swab the surfaces and were kept refrigerated (~4 °C) until use. In each home, for each surface, a 100 cm2 area was sampled in all cases except for complex shapes (such as doorknobs) in which case the shape was thoroughly wiped over its entire surface area, and the swab was returned to the sterile PBS and shaken. Aliquots of 1 mL of undiluted and 1 mL of 10−1 diluted samples were plated on 6 types of media for each sample: traditional plate count agar (PCA) pour plate, Easy Plate AC, and Petrifilm AC to target aerobic bacteria, and conventional potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol pour plate, Easy Plate YM-R, and Petrifilm RYM to target environmental fungi. Plates were incubated for 7 days at 25 °C, with cultivable microbial counts taken on Day 2 and Day 7; however, if plates were close to being too numerous to count on Day 2, colonies were counted and not incubated further. 2.4. International Space Station Sampling and Media Testing Preparation of inoculum: Methods for preparing sampling kits and processing samples were similar to those used in the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 missions [3,35,36]. Sterile TexTra™ 10 TX3224 Dry Cleanroom Wipers were moistened with 15 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), folded into quarters, and placed in sterile Ziploc baggies, which were later used to assemble the sampling kits at NASA Ames. Sample kits were transported to the ISS in June 2021. Over the course of five days, astronauts sampled the same square meter area of the same eight surfaces each day (see [3] for detailed surface descriptions). On each sampling day, for each surface, the astronaut tasked with sampling donned a new pair of sterile gloves, removed and unfolded a sterile wipe from its bag, and wiped a square meter area of the surface three times, folding the wipe in half for the second pass and into quarters for the third pass. Additionally, on each sampling day, a wipe was removed from its bag and briefly exposed to the air, as an environmental control sample. A total of 45 samples (8 surfaces + 1 control, ×5 days) were produced and stored at 4 °C aboard the ISS and during transport to Earth. Upon delivery to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the wipes were separated into batches and stored at 4 °C until processing. All wipes were processed within 48 h of arrival at the JPL for the isolation of environmental microbes. All lab procedures were performed for all samples within a 12 h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500 mL bottle with 200 mL sterile PBS and vigorously shaken for 2 min. In addition to the 45 ISS samples, an unopened wipe and a bottle of a sterile buffer without the addition of wipes were used as negative controls; no colonies resulted from these samples; thus, those data are not reported here. The PBS was then concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, MI, USA) with a 0.2 µm Polysulfone hollow-fiber-concentrating pipette tip. Using additional sterile PBS, the resulting PBS concentrate was adjusted to 4 mL for all samples, and dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were prepared. Inoculation and cultivable microbial counting: Two replicate spread plates were prepared for all three dilution levels (10−1, 10−2, and 10−3), using two types of agar media: Reasoner’s 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263) and PDA plates supplemented with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, for a total of 12 plates per sample (2 agar types × 3 dilution levels × 2 replicates; ~540 plates in total). This occupied a total of almost 0.1 cubic meters, the equivalent of a large moving box. For each of the two types of film media (Kikkoman Easy Plate AC and Easy Plate YM-R), 1 mL of the 10−1 dilution was directly pipetted into the center of each plate and then sealed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agar and film plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days; cultivable microbial counts were performed on Days 2 and 7. For ISS samples, PetriFilm media were not used. Isolation, purification, and identification of ISS strains: After cultivable microbial counting, up to 5 isolates were chosen from each combination of media type and sample. On both the agar plates and Easy Plates, colonies were deliberately selected for morphological differences, size, and colony coloration on agar plates. Colonies from Easy Plates were first streaked out onto TSA/PDA plates, incubated at 25 °C for 7 days, and imaged, before being transferred to 1:10 agar stabs of respective media. Similarly, the colonies from agar plates were directly transferred to respective agar stabs. The isolates were later streaked out for purification onto TSA or PDA plates. The secondary streak plates of purified isolates were sent to Azenta Life Sciences (Southfield, NJ, USA) for colony PCR + Sanger sequencing for the 16S rRNA gene or the ribosomal Internal Transcriber Space (ITS) region, respectively, for bacteria and fungi. Primers 27F and 1429R (27F 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′; 1492R 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [37] were used to target the entire 16S region (V1-V9) for bacterial strains. ITS regions 1 and 2 were targeted for fungal taxonomy using primers ITS1-F and ITS4 (ITS1 5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′; ITS4 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) [38]. Per Azenta Life Sciences standard operating procedure, enzymatic cleanup was performed after amplification using Exonuclease I—Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (ExoSAP), and dye-terminator Sanger sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems BigDye version 3.1 sequencing kit using an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Statistical analysis: All statistical analyses and figure creation were carried out in R. Consensus 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequences were generated using the sangeranalyzeR package [39], and genus/species identity was determined using the nearest match to the  nucleotide database. Type II linear models, Spearman and Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and paired and unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the correlations and mean differences between the cultivable microbial counts of agar and film media. Although a 1 m2 area was used for ISS samples, for this research communication, we have converted the unit to cultivable microbes per 100 cm2 in order to illustrate the extremely low bioburden of the ISS samples compared with that of the food-item and built-environment studies also sampled.",
    "results": "3. Results The microbial population enumerated with traditional agar plate, Petrifilm, and Easy Plate are depicted in Figure 1. All three types of media were used for the comparison of food products (Figure 1A) and built environments (Figure 1B for bacteria and Figure 1C for fungi). Only the R2A medium was compared with the Easy Plate method for estimating the bacterial population (Figure 1D) of the ISS samples. Similarly, the PDA medium and Easy Plate were employed to enumerate the fungal population (Figure 1E) from the ISS environmental surfaces. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Density distribution for overall food items (A), Earth-built-environment (B,C), and ISS surface (D,E) cultivable microbial counts for all media types. In food-item and Earth-built-environment testing (A–C), agar was compared with both Petrifilm and Easy Plates, while in ISS surface sampling (D,E), agar was only compared with Easy Plates. 3.1. Cultivable Population of Food Items Aerobic bacterial counts for food items ranged from 102 to 109 cultivable microbes per gram (Figure 1A). The counts correlated well between media types, with R2 values of 0.94 or greater and no significant difference between the mean bacterial cultivable microbial counts for each media type (Table 1, Figure 2). The mean log10 differences between media types were <2.5 (i.e., less than 100.34) colonies in all cases. Paired Wilcoxon tests between film media and agar were not significant but were significant between Easy Plate and Petrifilm media, with Easy Plate having slightly higher cultivable microbial counts. When broken down by food category, only the microbial community of raw poultry did not show a high correlation between agar and film media counts. However, the correlation between Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts was high for all food categories (Table 2). Table 1.

Cultivable Population of Built-Environment Surfaces Cultivable microbial counts for both bacterial- and fungal-specific media ranged from below the detection limit to 106 per swab (per 100 cm2 surface area) for built-environment surface samples (Figure 1B,C). There were no significant differences between mean cultivable microbial counts among the three media types, for either bacterial- or fungal-targeted media. In all cases, mean log10 differences between media types were less than 2.5 colonies (i.e., <100.34). Similar to the results for food items, the correlations between bacterial-specific film and agar media were high, with R2 values between 0.96 and 0.97, and no significant differences between the mean cultivable microbial counts were detected (Table 1, Figure 3). The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific media were lower than those for bacteria, with R2 values of ~0.73 for both Petrifilm RYM and Easy Plate YM-R when correlated to PDA. Easy Plate YM-R and Petrifilm RYM had higher correlations between them (R2 = 0.85), but there was still considerable variation in their counts. Paired Wilcoxon tests showed that Easy Plate AC had slightly lower cultivable microbial counts than both PCA and Petrifilm AC, which, as stated previously, was not large enough to cause a difference in mean cultivable microbial counts. The mean log10 differences between the media types were <0.34 (i.e., a non-log difference of 2 or fewer colonies) in all cases. Figure 3.

Cultivable Population of the International Space Station Cultivable microbial counts ranged from below the detection limit to 103 per wipe for both bacterial- (Figure 1D) and fungal-specific (Figure 1E) media (per 100 cm2 surface area). There was no difference between the mean cultivable microbial counts for Easy Plate AC vs. R2A, nor for Easy Plate YM-R vs. PDA (Table 1). The cultivable microbial count correlations were similar in food and Earth built environments for fungi, with R2 values of 0.73 for fungal-specific media, but were lower than Earth-based studies for bacteria-specific media, with an R2 of 0.80 (Figure 4A). This was due in part to the number of samples that had zero colonies for one or both media types (Figure 4B). The samples plated on Easy Plates, both AC and YM, were more likely to have cultivable microbial counts above the detection limit compared with agar media (Figure 4B). Figure 4.

TNTCs are included as arbitrarily high numbers in this figure but are not included in model calculations; (B) number of samples with zero vs. non-zero values for agar media vs. Easy Plates for ISS samples. 3.4. Specificity of Media Types for Bacteria or Fungi The differential isolation of bacteria and fungi by traditional agar and Easy Plate methods is shown in Figure S1. Among the 40 samples tested, 10 samples yielded at least one bacterial colony in Easy Plate AC but were not present in the R2A medium. In contrast, one R2A medium showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate AC method failed to yield any colony. The further isolation, purification, and identification of the bacteria grown in the R2A plate revealed the presence of Sphingomonas lutea. The pure strain of S. lutea isolate was regrown in the Easy Plate AC medium and showed growth. Similarly, among the 40 samples tested for fungal population estimation, 6 samples showed growth of at least one fungal colony in Easy Plate YM-R but did not show growth in the PDA medium. In contrast, two PDA plates showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate YM-R method failed to yield any colony. Further ITS-based identification using blast searches against the  database revealed that these fungal isolates were closely related to Aureobasidium leucospermi and Penicillium rubens, and subsequent growth in Easy Plate YM-R yielded growth, revealing that there was no inhibition in growth in the Easy Plate YM-R medium. For ISS samples, neither PDA + chloramphenicol agar media nor Easy Plate YM-R (which also contains chloramphenicol) isolated bacterial strains, but R2A and Easy Plate AC both promoted the growth of a significant number of fungi (Figure 5B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab (A) Distribution of bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC vs. R2A agar media; (B) distribution of fungal genera isolated from Easy Plate AC and YT, and R2A, and PDA agar media. Points are colored by genus. 3.5. Species and Genus Distributions for Bacterial and Fungal Isolates The dominant bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC and R2A were similar, with multiple strains of Staphylococcus species and Kalamiella piersonii isolated by both types of media (Figure 5A). However, after 7 days of growth, a single isolate of five slow-growing species was isolated from R2A (Methylobacterium tolerans, Kocuria marina, Bacillus zhangzouensis, Psueodomonas parafulva, and Sphingomonas lutea) but not from Easy Plate AC, while multiple strains of Micrococcus aloverae were isolated from Easy Plate AC but not from R2A. In addition, the16S rRNA gene-sequence-based species identity was at 97% or above for all the isolates and above 99% for most. Since the ITS is not suitable to define fungal species, the genus-level identification was recorded. The fungal identification for isolates (Figure 5B) was similar across the board, with multiple strains of Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Agicarus isolated from R2A, PDA, and Easy Plate AC and YM-R. Easy Plate YM-R also isolated a single strain of Cladosporium and Byssocorticium, while PDA isolated a single strain of Aureobasidium. A more significant difference was the lack of the yeast genus Rhodotorula from Easy Plate AC isolates, whereas R2A plates promoted the growth of Rhodotorula species. We, therefore, plated a Rhodotorula isolate onto Easy Plate AC while also inoculating Easy Plate YM-R, R2A, and PDA with the same cell dilution for comparison. While Rhodotorula grew on Easy Plate AC medium, it was simply not visible to the eye, and the only way to detect it was to plate out random locations from the Easy Plate on different media. This was in contrast to non-yeast fungal species, which were highly visible on Easy Plate AC.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In general, the use of film media over agar allows for lower costs, greatly increased inoculation speed, greatly reduced experimental preparation time, and much smaller amounts of space required in incubators or counters; these advantages have been discussed in numerous previous reports [28]. When dealing with high volumes of samples that must be processed in a very short amount of time, film media such as Petrifilm and Easy Plates provide distinct advantages. In processing the ISS samples, plating the same number of samples on Easy Plates took one person 2 h, as opposed to three people taking 8 h to inoculate the agar plates. The use of film media or pour plates requires fewer dilutions than spread plates because it can produce accurate plate counts at higher bioburden levels, which is not necessarily a fair comparison of the time spent. However, in addition to a pipetting step, spread plates require either retrieving a pre-sterilized spreader from its packaging or sterilizing a reusable spreader and thoroughly spreading the sample over the surface without damaging the agar. For upwards of 300 agar plates per experiment, this adds up to multiple hours. In this study, we found no particular advantage or disadvantage to using Petrifilm (3M) vs. Easy Plates (Kikkoman), except for the lack of necessity of using a spreader for Kikkoman plates. The cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and food samples correlated extremely well with counts from agar media and with each other. The one exception to this trend was the bacterial counts from raw poultry products, where Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts correlated well with each other but did not correlate with agar; given the small number of poultry samples (n = 4), this trend would need to be investigated further to be considered significant. The ranges of cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and ISS samples in this study were considerably lower, including many samples below the detection limit for one or both types of media, than almost all the previously published studies using film media in other environments. Most ISS samples had low cultivable microbial counts that were below the cultivable microbial count standard for hospital cleanliness (2.5 × 102 cultivable microbes per 100 cm2, OR 102.4 per 100 cm2) [32]. The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific agar and film media were lower than the correlations for bacteria and ranged from adjusted R2 values 0.73 to 0.82 for built-environment samples and ISS samples. The correlation between bacterial-specific agar vs. film media was lower for ISS samples (adj R2 = 0.80) than Earth built environments (R2 = 0.94–0.98), probably due to both the low bioburden in ISS samples and the presence of considerable fungi growing on bacterial-specific media, which might have masked the presence of bacteria. It is noteworthy to mention here that the increase in inoculum size (1 mL) yielded cultivable counts more in film media (10 samples for bacteria and 6 samples for fungi; Figure 5) than the traditional agar(s) used (100 µL). The species distribution for film media vs. agar media was similar between both fungal-specific and bacteria-specific plates. Three main differences were that (1) yeast colonies grew but were not visible on Easy Plate AC (although non-yeast fungal colonies were visible and countable), whereas yeast colonies were of course visible on R2A; (2) Easy Plates isolated multiple strains of Micrococcus, whereas R2A did not; and (3) isolation from R2A allowed for the isolation of single strains of slow-growing low-nutrient-loving bacterial species not isolated on Easy Plates, from minuscule colonies. In some cases, the minuscule colony had a distinct color that allowed us to select it as a colony of interest from the agar, whereas on the Easy Plate, it was not distinguishable from other colonies; in some cases, there was only a single tiny colony on the agar plate vs. no colony on the Easy Plate, which could be due to random chance: In at least two cases, there would have been no way to pick the rare species out, and it was chance that led us to collect it. Inoculating well-grown colonies isolated from R2A onto Easy Plate AC medium allowed the growth of these minuscule colonies. Picking colonies out by their relative size on film media is difficult, as the dye used in Petrifilm and Easy Plates magnifies the size of tiny colonies. Additionally, without a clear view of colony morphology and color that agar provides, it is possible that isolating “rare” species might have been overlooked. This could be an advantage or disadvantage of film media depending on the goals and study design (it removes non-random sampling biases, but if one is sampling non-randomly, it may result in a lower diversity of isolates). Other disadvantages of film media are that (1) because of the smaller surface area and the miniaturization of colonies, it was difficult to count colonies by eye for high bioburden samples, and in a few cases, counting from magnified photographs was necessary (3M has developed an automated CFU counter for use with Petrifilm plates, which negates this issue), and (2) because colony color was not observable, and morphology was somewhat obscured in film media, it would be extremely difficult to rule out the colonies of a known contaminant that appeared also in control plates (for example, in a situation where samples are plated out in the field or in otherwise non-laboratory conditions). Surfaces in built environments inhabited by humans and animals are inherently difficult to consistently sample for cultivable microbial counts, due to having higher fungal:bacterial ratios and the presence of hairs and fibers, which adsorb bacterial and fungal spores, thus requiring multiple replicates to obtain an accurate count. Even with every effort made to vortex or otherwise homogenize samples before plating, in extremely low-biomass environments, the presence or absence of a single hair or fiber might make the difference between a zero and non-zero cultivable microbial count, or a lower or higher cultivable microbial count. Human habitation and the accompanying presence of dust, fibers, and hairs from bodies and cloth, combined with extremely low surface biomass due to constant cleaning and well-filtered air, is a combination peculiar to hospital environments [40], clean rooms [41], and space habitats [42,43]; however, because astronauts do not wear masks, gloves, or other protective equipment aboard the ISS, the problem of hairs and fibers is exacerbated. One study tested the efficacy of Petrifilm vs. contact plates on regular hospital surfaces and found that Petrifilm detected larger numbers of cultivable microbes [32]; however, cultivable microbial counts in that study were higher than what would be considered “low bioburden” (i.e., comparable to a clean room or the ISS). In a study of debris and lint collected via vacuuming the ISS surfaces, fibers and hairs—as opposed to tinier particles such as skin cells with a greater surface area—yielded a distinct microbial community with greater fungal diversity and only one order of magnitude fewer cultivable microbes than powdery debris despite a vastly smaller surface area [42]. Therefore, the use of a larger volume is critical for accurate plate counts. As film media use a 10× higher volume than traditional spread plates, while not presenting the same challenges of possible heat death (molten agar at 55 °C) and excavation that isolating bacteria and fungi presents when using pour plates [44,45], film media are well-suited for use with samples from the ISS and other future space habitats. In fact, because film media are extremely light, and thin, and rely on water cohesion and adhesion rather than gravity or manual spreading, they may be suitable for testing in microgravity in the future and may be a possible method for both food and environmental safety testing for future space habitats.",

Copyright notice ID: 9503880 PMID: 36144316 Abstract The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well. Keywords: CFU, International Space Station, environmental microbiome, agar media, film media, Easy Plate, Petrifilm1. Introduction Counts of cultivable bacteria and fungi from food items, water samples, and surfaces are a traditional mainstay for public health standards and assessment, as well as the core method that NASA uses to ensure that any craft or robot launched into space meets planetary protection regulations [1]. Preparing, plating, incubating, and counting samples using traditional agar plates, however, generates a great deal of plastic and organic waste and can be prohibitive in terms of the time and space required. Obtaining cultivable microbial counts from low-biomass arenas, including pure water samples, hospitals, clean rooms, and space habitats such as the International Space Station (ISS), presents additional challenges. The samples from these environments are often below detection limits when using standard plating methodology and dilutions [2,3,4], requiring larger numbers and volumes of samples to characterize microbial bioburden [5]. During a survey of multiple NASA clean rooms, for example, more than 30% of samples were below the detection limit for measuring the number of cultivable microbes [6]. In addition, the whole-genome sequencing of isolated fungi and bacteria from cultivable approaches is often necessary for further phenotypic and genomic characterization, which can be used to understand the functional and physiological traits of cultivable microorganisms. For example, isolates from hospitals and human habitats are often assessed for changes or increases in virulence and antibiotic resistance, e.g., [7,8,9]. Similarly, the NASA community is in need of understanding the yet-to-be cultured microorganisms for their possible survival or proliferation in extraterrestrial conditions [10,11,12,13]. Therefore, any improvements or changes in plating methods must not only produce cultivable microbial counts comparable to traditional methods but must also not change the ratios or types of the isolated species. For the last 50 years, miniaturized stackable media called “film” media have been available as alternatives to traditional agar [14]. Petrifilm was developed by 3M in the 1980s as an alternative to agar spread and pour plates. It consists of a thin wafer of nutrient/gelling agent between two plastic films. Petrifilm was designed to plate 1 mL of a sample on a surface with the approximate size and volume of a playing card, using dyes such as tetrazolium to indicate colony growth [15]. This greatly reduces both the volume of incubator space needed to grow a large number of samples and the time and materials needed to prepare agar plates. According to 3M, Petrifilm media “take up 85% less space, reduce waste 66%, greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, and water waste by 79%” compared with agar plates [15]. Recently, Kikkoman/Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) has developed another brand of film media, Easy Plates, which are similar to Petrifilm in many respects but which have the advantage of a hydrophobic resin ring surrounding the medium which negates the use of a spreader tool, reducing preparation time even further. In addition, the Easy Plate design purportedly increases the ease of counting by its reduced liquefaction of the gel compared with Petrifilm [16]. Previous reports on Petrifilm media found that they produced statistically similar results for cultivable microbial counts to those of agar plate methods for food and environmental safety testing, including aerobic bacteria in raw milk [17], poultry [18], fungal counts on dairy products [19], food items spiked with a variety of common molds [20], and aerobic or coliform bacteria in wastewater [21]. More recent studies showed that film media obtained equivalent counts to agar for soil samples inoculated with varying concentrations of E. coli [22], steel and porcelain surfaces inoculated with ubiquitous built-environment bacteria [23], biofilm samples using drop plating [24], and bacterial counts on a variety of food items [25]. There has also been extensive testing of film media in the dairy industry which is leading to the adoption of Petrifilm as a standard method for the enumeration of aerobic and coliform bacteria [26,27,28,29]. Petrifilm is now becoming a widely used method of bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counting and isolation in place of agar media [29,30]. Most studies testing film vs. agar media performance for cultivable microbial counts have focused on high-bioburden environments and samples such as dairy products and food, or samples/surfaces that are pre-inoculated with a known microbial consortium. Film media are only recently being assessed for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms and hospitals [31,32,33]. Recently, researchers from NASA compared Petrifilm Rapid Aerobic Count (RAC) plates with tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates for measuring the bioburden of an extremely low-biomass clean room environment and found that Petrifilm was equal to TSA plates in aerobic bacterial estimation [31]. In addition, Petrifilm was found to be superior to TSA in containing colonies that could spread and grow to cover 25% or more area of agar plate [31]. Kikkoman’s Easy Plates have not yet been compared in the scientific literature for their performance relative to both agar plates and Petrifilm. While film media have been previously used in place of agar plating to assess cultivable microbial counts for built environments and hospitals [30], they have not been tested in extremely low-biomass environments, particularly those with high fiber counts. Additionally, because Easy Plates entirely rely on water adhesion/cohesion forces for inoculation rather than manual spreading, it is likely that they could be viable options for environmental monitoring in micro- or low-gravity settings in future space installations. Therefore, our objectives for this study were to (1) test the bacterial enumeration performance among agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates for a variety of food items; (2) compare the cultivable microbial counts in an Earth-built-environment setting for agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates using bacterial- and fungal-specific media; and (3) test the efficacy of Easy Plates as an alternative method for bacterial and fungal bioburden estimation and the isolation of bacterial and fungal strains for surface samples from the ISS, for both cultivable microbial counts and species composition of isolates. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Descriptions of Petrifilm and Easy Plate Media Tested According to the manufacturer’s instruction manuals, Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) Plate [15] (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat# 6400) and Easy Plate AC [16] (Kikkoman, Noda, Chiba, Japan, Cat# 61973) were used for the enumeration of aerobic bacteria, and Petrifilm Rapid Yeast and Mold Count (RYM) Plate (3M, Cat# 6475) and Easy Plate YM-R (Kikkoman, Cat# 61977) were used for the enumeration of yeast and mold in the food and beverage industries. In general, in food and beverage microbiological testing, both the Petrifilm AC and Easy Plate AC count red colonies after 48 h of incubation at 35 °C. Petrifilm RYM counts blue-green colonies after 48 h of incubation at 25 °C or 28 °C, and Easy Plate YM-R counts purple colonies after 48 h at 25 °C. Both media can extend the incubation time up to 3–7 days if the colonies appear faint.2.2. Food-Item Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing Food items (n = 63), including raw and cooked meats, vegetables, nuts, and processed foods (see Supplementary Table S1 for list), were homogenized with 90 mL (10 g samples) or 225 mL (25 g samples) of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed. One milliliter of each dilution was inoculated into each medium (Plate Count Agar, Petrifilm AC, and Easy Plate AC), incubated for 48 h at 35 °C, which are standard FDA methods for food safety testing [34], and the number of bacteria was counted. Fungal counts were not assayed for food samples.2.3. Built-Environment Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing The surfaces of Japanese homes (n = 5) were sampled for bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counts. At each home, three different surfaces were sampled: one expected low-bioburden (example: window glass), one expected medium-bioburden, and one expected high-bioburden (example: living room floor) sample. Pro-media ST-25 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab kits from ELMEX LIMITED (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan), consisting of a cotton swab in 10 mL of sterile PBS, were used to swab the surfaces and were kept refrigerated (~4 °C) until use. In each home, for each surface, a 100 cm2 area was sampled in all cases except for complex shapes (such as doorknobs) in which case the shape was thoroughly wiped over its entire surface area, and the swab was returned to the sterile PBS and shaken. Aliquots of 1 mL of undiluted and 1 mL of 10−1 diluted samples were plated on 6 types of media for each sample: traditional plate count agar (PCA) pour plate, Easy Plate AC, and Petrifilm AC to target aerobic bacteria, and conventional potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol pour plate, Easy Plate YM-R, and Petrifilm RYM to target environmental fungi. Plates were incubated for 7 days at 25 °C, with cultivable microbial counts taken on Day 2 and Day 7; however, if plates were close to being too numerous to count on Day 2, colonies were counted and not incubated further. 2.4. International Space Station Sampling and Media Testing Preparation of inoculum: Methods for preparing sampling kits and processing samples were similar to those used in the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 missions [3,35,36]. Sterile TexTra™ 10 TX3224 Dry Cleanroom Wipers were moistened with 15 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), folded into quarters, and placed in sterile Ziploc baggies, which were later used to assemble the sampling kits at NASA Ames. Sample kits were transported to the ISS in June 2021. Over the course of five days, astronauts sampled the same square meter area of the same eight surfaces each day (see [3] for detailed surface descriptions). On each sampling day, for each surface, the astronaut tasked with sampling donned a new pair of sterile gloves, removed and unfolded a sterile wipe from its bag, and wiped a square meter area of the surface three times, folding the wipe in half for the second pass and into quarters for the third pass. Additionally, on each sampling day, a wipe was removed from its bag and briefly exposed to the air, as an environmental control sample. A total of 45 samples (8 surfaces + 1 control, ×5 days) were produced and stored at 4 °C aboard the ISS and during transport to Earth. Upon delivery to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the wipes were separated into batches and stored at 4 °C until processing. All wipes were processed within 48 h of arrival at the JPL for the isolation of environmental microbes. All lab procedures were performed for all samples within a 12 h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500 mL bottle with 200 mL sterile PBS and vigorously shaken for 2 min. In addition to the 45 ISS samples, an unopened wipe and a bottle of a sterile buffer without the addition of wipes were used as negative controls; no colonies resulted from these samples; thus, those data are not reported here. The PBS was then concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, MI, USA) with a 0.2 µm Polysulfone hollow-fiber-concentrating pipette tip. Using additional sterile PBS, the resulting PBS concentrate was adjusted to 4 mL for all samples, and dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were prepared. Inoculation and cultivable microbial counting: Two replicate spread plates were prepared for all three dilution levels (10−1, 10−2, and 10−3), using two types of agar media: Reasoner’s 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263) and PDA plates supplemented with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, for a total of 12 plates per sample (2 agar types × 3 dilution levels × 2 replicates; ~540 plates in total). This occupied a total of almost 0.1 cubic meters, the equivalent of a large moving box. For each of the two types of film media (Kikkoman Easy Plate AC and Easy Plate YM-R), 1 mL of the 10−1 dilution was directly pipetted into the center of each plate and then sealed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agar and film plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days; cultivable microbial counts were performed on Days 2 and 7. For ISS samples, PetriFilm media were not used. Isolation, purification, and identification of ISS strains: After cultivable microbial counting, up to 5 isolates were chosen from each combination of media type and sample. On both the agar plates and Easy Plates, colonies were deliberately selected for morphological differences, size, and colony coloration on agar plates. Colonies from Easy Plates were first streaked out onto TSA/PDA plates, incubated at 25 °C for 7 days, and imaged, before being transferred to 1:10 agar stabs of respective media. Similarly, the colonies from agar plates were directly transferred to respective agar stabs. The isolates were later streaked out for purification onto TSA or PDA plates. The secondary streak plates of purified isolates were sent to Azenta Life Sciences (Southfield, NJ, USA) for colony PCR + Sanger sequencing for the 16S rRNA gene or the ribosomal Internal Transcriber Space (ITS) region, respectively, for bacteria and fungi. Primers 27F and 1429R (27F 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′; 1492R 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [37] were used to target the entire 16S region (V1-V9) for bacterial strains. ITS regions 1 and 2 were targeted for fungal taxonomy using primers ITS1-F and ITS4 (ITS1 5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′; ITS4 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) [38]. Per Azenta Life Sciences standard operating procedure, enzymatic cleanup was performed after amplification using Exonuclease I—Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (ExoSAP), and dye-terminator Sanger sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems BigDye version 3.1 sequencing kit using an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Statistical analysis: All statistical analyses and figure creation were carried out in R. Consensus 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequences were generated using the sangeranalyzeR package [39], and genus/species identity was determined using the nearest match to the  nucleotide database. Type II linear models, Spearman and Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and paired and unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the correlations and mean differences between the cultivable microbial counts of agar and film media. Although a 1 m2 area was used for ISS samples, for this research communication, we have converted the unit to cultivable microbes per 100 cm2 in order to illustrate the extremely low bioburden of the ISS samples compared with that of the food-item and built-environment studies also sampled.3. Results The microbial population enumerated with traditional agar plate, Petrifilm, and Easy Plate are depicted in Figure 1. All three types of media were used for the comparison of food products (Figure 1A) and built environments (Figure 1B for bacteria and Figure 1C for fungi). Only the R2A medium was compared with the Easy Plate method for estimating the bacterial population (Figure 1D) of the ISS samples. Similarly, the PDA medium and Easy Plate were employed to enumerate the fungal population (Figure 1E) from the ISS environmental surfaces. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Density distribution for overall food items (A), Earth-built-environment (B,C), and ISS surface (D,E) cultivable microbial counts for all media types. In food-item and Earth-built-environment testing (A–C), agar was compared with both Petrifilm and Easy Plates, while in ISS surface sampling (D,E), agar was only compared with Easy Plates.3.1. Cultivable Population of Food Items Aerobic bacterial counts for food items ranged from 102 to 109 cultivable microbes per gram (Figure 1A). The counts correlated well between media types, with R2 values of 0.94 or greater and no significant difference between the mean bacterial cultivable microbial counts for each media type (Table 1, Figure 2). The mean log10 differences between media types were <2.5 (i.e., less than 100.34) colonies in all cases. Paired Wilcoxon tests between film media and agar were not significant but were significant between Easy Plate and Petrifilm media, with Easy Plate having slightly higher cultivable microbial counts. When broken down by food category, only the microbial community of raw poultry did not show a high correlation between agar and film media counts. However, the correlation between Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts was high for all food categories (Table 2). Table 1.

Cultivable Population of Built-Environment Surfaces Cultivable microbial counts for both bacterial- and fungal-specific media ranged from below the detection limit to 106 per swab (per 100 cm2 surface area) for built-environment surface samples (Figure 1B,C). There were no significant differences between mean cultivable microbial counts among the three media types, for either bacterial- or fungal-targeted media. In all cases, mean log10 differences between media types were less than 2.5 colonies (i.e., <100.34). Similar to the results for food items, the correlations between bacterial-specific film and agar media were high, with R2 values between 0.96 and 0.97, and no significant differences between the mean cultivable microbial counts were detected (Table 1, Figure 3). The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific media were lower than those for bacteria, with R2 values of ~0.73 for both Petrifilm RYM and Easy Plate YM-R when correlated to PDA. Easy Plate YM-R and Petrifilm RYM had higher correlations between them (R2 = 0.85), but there was still considerable variation in their counts. Paired Wilcoxon tests showed that Easy Plate AC had slightly lower cultivable microbial counts than both PCA and Petrifilm AC, which, as stated previously, was not large enough to cause a difference in mean cultivable microbial counts. The mean log10 differences between the media types were <0.34 (i.e., a non-log difference of 2 or fewer colonies) in all cases. Figure 3.

PDA = potato dextrose agar; PCA = plate count agar. All cultivable microbial counts are per 100 cm2 of surface area. Blue solid line is linear regression; shading is 95% confidence interval.3.3. Cultivable Population of the International Space Station Cultivable microbial counts ranged from below the detection limit to 103 per wipe for both bacterial- (Figure 1D) and fungal-specific (Figure 1E) media (per 100 cm2 surface area). There was no difference between the mean cultivable microbial counts for Easy Plate AC vs. R2A, nor for Easy Plate YM-R vs. PDA (Table 1). The cultivable microbial count correlations were similar in food and Earth built environments for fungi, with R2 values of 0.73 for fungal-specific media, but were lower than Earth-based studies for bacteria-specific media, with an R2 of 0.80 (Figure 4A). This was due in part to the number of samples that had zero colonies for one or both media types (Figure 4B). The samples plated on Easy Plates, both AC and YM, were more likely to have cultivable microbial counts above the detection limit compared with agar media (Figure 4B). Figure 4.

Specificity of Media Types for Bacteria or Fungi The differential isolation of bacteria and fungi by traditional agar and Easy Plate methods is shown in Figure S1. Among the 40 samples tested, 10 samples yielded at least one bacterial colony in Easy Plate AC but were not present in the R2A medium. In contrast, one R2A medium showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate AC method failed to yield any colony. The further isolation, purification, and identification of the bacteria grown in the R2A plate revealed the presence of Sphingomonas lutea. The pure strain of S. lutea isolate was regrown in the Easy Plate AC medium and showed growth. Similarly, among the 40 samples tested for fungal population estimation, 6 samples showed growth of at least one fungal colony in Easy Plate YM-R but did not show growth in the PDA medium. In contrast, two PDA plates showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate YM-R method failed to yield any colony. Further ITS-based identification using blast searches against the  database revealed that these fungal isolates were closely related to Aureobasidium leucospermi and Penicillium rubens, and subsequent growth in Easy Plate YM-R yielded growth, revealing that there was no inhibition in growth in the Easy Plate YM-R medium. For ISS samples, neither PDA + chloramphenicol agar media nor Easy Plate YM-R (which also contains chloramphenicol) isolated bacterial strains, but R2A and Easy Plate AC both promoted the growth of a significant number of fungi (Figure 5B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab (A) Distribution of bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC vs. R2A agar media; (B) distribution of fungal genera isolated from Easy Plate AC and YT, and R2A, and PDA agar media. Points are colored by genus.3.5. Species and Genus Distributions for Bacterial and Fungal Isolates The dominant bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC and R2A were similar, with multiple strains of Staphylococcus species and Kalamiella piersonii isolated by both types of media (Figure 5A). However, after 7 days of growth, a single isolate of five slow-growing species was isolated from R2A (Methylobacterium tolerans, Kocuria marina, Bacillus zhangzouensis, Psueodomonas parafulva, and Sphingomonas lutea) but not from Easy Plate AC, while multiple strains of Micrococcus aloverae were isolated from Easy Plate AC but not from R2A. In addition, the16S rRNA gene-sequence-based species identity was at 97% or above for all the isolates and above 99% for most. Since the ITS is not suitable to define fungal species, the genus-level identification was recorded. The fungal identification for isolates (Figure 5B) was similar across the board, with multiple strains of Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Agicarus isolated from R2A, PDA, and Easy Plate AC and YM-R. Easy Plate YM-R also isolated a single strain of Cladosporium and Byssocorticium, while PDA isolated a single strain of Aureobasidium. A more significant difference was the lack of the yeast genus Rhodotorula from Easy Plate AC isolates, whereas R2A plates promoted the growth of Rhodotorula species. We, therefore, plated a Rhodotorula isolate onto Easy Plate AC while also inoculating Easy Plate YM-R, R2A, and PDA with the same cell dilution for comparison. While Rhodotorula grew on Easy Plate AC medium, it was simply not visible to the eye, and the only way to detect it was to plate out random locations from the Easy Plate on different media. This was in contrast to non-yeast fungal species, which were highly visible on Easy Plate AC.4. Discussion In general, the use of film media over agar allows for lower costs, greatly increased inoculation speed, greatly reduced experimental preparation time, and much smaller amounts of space required in incubators or counters; these advantages have been discussed in numerous previous reports [28]. When dealing with high volumes of samples that must be processed in a very short amount of time, film media such as Petrifilm and Easy Plates provide distinct advantages. In processing the ISS samples, plating the same number of samples on Easy Plates took one person 2 h, as opposed to three people taking 8 h to inoculate the agar plates. The use of film media or pour plates requires fewer dilutions than spread plates because it can produce accurate plate counts at higher bioburden levels, which is not necessarily a fair comparison of the time spent. However, in addition to a pipetting step, spread plates require either retrieving a pre-sterilized spreader from its packaging or sterilizing a reusable spreader and thoroughly spreading the sample over the surface without damaging the agar. For upwards of 300 agar plates per experiment, this adds up to multiple hours. In this study, we found no particular advantage or disadvantage to using Petrifilm (3M) vs. Easy Plates (Kikkoman), except for the lack of necessity of using a spreader for Kikkoman plates. The cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and food samples correlated extremely well with counts from agar media and with each other. The one exception to this trend was the bacterial counts from raw poultry products, where Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts correlated well with each other but did not correlate with agar; given the small number of poultry samples (n = 4), this trend would need to be investigated further to be considered significant. The ranges of cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and ISS samples in this study were considerably lower, including many samples below the detection limit for one or both types of media, than almost all the previously published studies using film media in other environments. Most ISS samples had low cultivable microbial counts that were below the cultivable microbial count standard for hospital cleanliness (2.5 × 102 cultivable microbes per 100 cm2, OR 102.4 per 100 cm2) [32]. The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific agar and film media were lower than the correlations for bacteria and ranged from adjusted R2 values 0.73 to 0.82 for built-environment samples and ISS samples. The correlation between bacterial-specific agar vs. film media was lower for ISS samples (adj R2 = 0.80) than Earth built environments (R2 = 0.94–0.98), probably due to both the low bioburden in ISS samples and the presence of considerable fungi growing on bacterial-specific media, which might have masked the presence of bacteria. It is noteworthy to mention here that the increase in inoculum size (1 mL) yielded cultivable counts more in film media (10 samples for bacteria and 6 samples for fungi; Figure 5) than the traditional agar(s) used (100 µL). The species distribution for film media vs. agar media was similar between both fungal-specific and bacteria-specific plates. Three main differences were that (1) yeast colonies grew but were not visible on Easy Plate AC (although non-yeast fungal colonies were visible and countable), whereas yeast colonies were of course visible on R2A; (2) Easy Plates isolated multiple strains of Micrococcus, whereas R2A did not; and (3) isolation from R2A allowed for the isolation of single strains of slow-growing low-nutrient-loving bacterial species not isolated on Easy Plates, from minuscule colonies. In some cases, the minuscule colony had a distinct color that allowed us to select it as a colony of interest from the agar, whereas on the Easy Plate, it was not distinguishable from other colonies; in some cases, there was only a single tiny colony on the agar plate vs. no colony on the Easy Plate, which could be due to random chance: In at least two cases, there would have been no way to pick the rare species out, and it was chance that led us to collect it. Inoculating well-grown colonies isolated from R2A onto Easy Plate AC medium allowed the growth of these minuscule colonies. Picking colonies out by their relative size on film media is difficult, as the dye used in Petrifilm and Easy Plates magnifies the size of tiny colonies. Additionally, without a clear view of colony morphology and color that agar provides, it is possible that isolating “rare” species might have been overlooked. This could be an advantage or disadvantage of film media depending on the goals and study design (it removes non-random sampling biases, but if one is sampling non-randomly, it may result in a lower diversity of isolates). Other disadvantages of film media are that (1) because of the smaller surface area and the miniaturization of colonies, it was difficult to count colonies by eye for high bioburden samples, and in a few cases, counting from magnified photographs was necessary (3M has developed an automated CFU counter for use with Petrifilm plates, which negates this issue), and (2) because colony color was not observable, and morphology was somewhat obscured in film media, it would be extremely difficult to rule out the colonies of a known contaminant that appeared also in control plates (for example, in a situation where samples are plated out in the field or in otherwise non-laboratory conditions). Surfaces in built environments inhabited by humans and animals are inherently difficult to consistently sample for cultivable microbial counts, due to having higher fungal:bacterial ratios and the presence of hairs and fibers, which adsorb bacterial and fungal spores, thus requiring multiple replicates to obtain an accurate count. Even with every effort made to vortex or otherwise homogenize samples before plating, in extremely low-biomass environments, the presence or absence of a single hair or fiber might make the difference between a zero and non-zero cultivable microbial count, or a lower or higher cultivable microbial count. Human habitation and the accompanying presence of dust, fibers, and hairs from bodies and cloth, combined with extremely low surface biomass due to constant cleaning and well-filtered air, is a combination peculiar to hospital environments [40], clean rooms [41], and space habitats [42,43]; however, because astronauts do not wear masks, gloves, or other protective equipment aboard the ISS, the problem of hairs and fibers is exacerbated. One study tested the efficacy of Petrifilm vs. contact plates on regular hospital surfaces and found that Petrifilm detected larger numbers of cultivable microbes [32]; however, cultivable microbial counts in that study were higher than what would be considered “low bioburden” (i.e., comparable to a clean room or the ISS). In a study of debris and lint collected via vacuuming the ISS surfaces, fibers and hairs—as opposed to tinier particles such as skin cells with a greater surface area—yielded a distinct microbial community with greater fungal diversity and only one order of magnitude fewer cultivable microbes than powdery debris despite a vastly smaller surface area [42]. Therefore, the use of a larger volume is critical for accurate plate counts. As film media use a 10× higher volume than traditional spread plates, while not presenting the same challenges of possible heat death (molten agar at 55 °C) and excavation that isolating bacteria and fungi presents when using pour plates [44,45], film media are well-suited for use with samples from the ISS and other future space habitats. In fact, because film media are extremely light, and thin, and rely on water cohesion and adhesion rather than gravity or manual spreading, they may be suitable for testing in microgravity in the future and may be a possible method for both food and environmental safety testing for future space habitats.Acknowledgments Part of the research described was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.
