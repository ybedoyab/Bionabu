    "abstract": "Abstract Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction On Earth, plants are exposed to a unidirectional 1-g force that guides the growth of their organs (gravitropism). Furthermore, the weight imposed by gravity on each organ results in a mechanical load that must be counteracted by thick, sturdy cell walls and specialized morphologies. Millions of years of evolution on Earth have assured the effectiveness of these gravitropic, gravi-resistance, and gravimorphogenesis processes, allowing plants to grow and develop properly, forming morphologies that effectively permit completion of their life cycle [1]. Spaceflight, on the other hand, imposes very different constraints on the plants, which they never encountered during their evolution on Earth. During spaceflight, the directional cue provided by gravity is insufficient to modulate gravitropism, gravi-resistance, and other directional cues within the environment. Therefore other tropisms have to take over and guide plant organ growth, including light, gradients in water, oxygen, temperature, ions, and chemicals [2,3]. Similarly, the weightlessness associated with microgravity exposure implies a lack of weight-bearing on plant organs, leading to different mechanical constraints on their growth behaviors [1,4]. Other critical alterations of the physical environment encountered by plants during spaceflight include a lack of gravity-induced convection resulting in diminished gas exchange at the surface of the plant, altered photosynthesis, respiration, hypoxia, and thermoregulation [1,2,5,6,7,8]. Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [9]. Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named “space syndrome”. These include shorter organs, thinner leaves, roots tending to grow away from the light source (negative phototropism) while also skewing in some cases, root hairs of altered size, modified organelle size and shape, altered metabolism, and accumulation of starch, to cite only a few [10,11,12,13,14]. Researchers have heavily relied on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to reveal key molecular pathways that are responsive to the spaceflight environment relative to ground controls. Experiments using mostly Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings or plant tissue cultures as experimental materials have revealed potential contributions of Ca2+, light and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, cell wall remodeling, and defense responses in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment [6,8,10,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Some of these expression changes were accompanied by alterations in the pattern of CNG and CNN DNA methylation in the proximity of the corresponding genes, suggesting some epigenetic contribution to the process [24]. Interestingly, a short root-hair phenotype displayed by Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the BRIC hardware onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) was accompanied by decreased expression of genes associated with oxidative stress (such as peroxidases) and cell wall remodeling, and reverse genetics demonstrated a contribution of some of these genes in modulation of root hair growth [14]. The profiling investigations described above have revealed a large variability in expression responses between experiments due in part to differences in hardware used to grow the plants, growth conditions, and plant genotypes (reviewed in [25]). The latter parameter (plant genotype) is particularly interesting to consider. Indeed, the geographical origin of a specific plant accession plays a key role in defining the type of responses the plant will develop under specific environmental conditions, reflecting an important role for selective forces in dictating the evolution of adaptive traits. Consequently, for any plant species, individual ecotypes carry specific sets of alleles that allowed the plants to not only survive and adapt to the conditions of their native environment, but also result in distinct abilities to cope with new environments to which they might subsequently become exposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments attempting to evaluate Arabidopsis’s ability to adapt to the microgravity environment have revealed dramatic accession-specific differences in their ability to grow, develop, and respond molecularly to this novel environment. In fact, most experiments aimed at investigating Arabidopsis transcriptional responses to spaceflight have been carried out using the Col ecotype at the seedling stage [10,14,15,20,26] or as cell cultures [18,21]. Additionally, transcriptomic responses to spaceflight of Ler-0 and Ws ecotypes have been investigated in multiple space environments such as in Space Shuttles [8] and the International Space Station (ISS) [17,22], using a variety of hardware such as the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS: [10,15]) or the CARA experiment [16], respectively. More recently, a landmark paper described a more thorough comparative transcriptomic analysis of four Arabidopsis ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0) exposed to either microgravity conditions or 1-g [6]. Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that different accessions display both common and accession-specific responses to the microgravity environment relative to ground controls. Shared transcriptomic responses included the activation of expression of molecular chaperones that may protect the cells against oxidative damage imposed by the hypoxic conditions that typically develop around plant organs in the absence of convective buoyancy under microgravity [6]. While Arabidopsis thaliana serves as an outstanding genetic model for investigations of dicot plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight, most major agriculture crops grown on Earth for food, feed, and fiber are monocots, which diverged from the dicots ~150 million years ago [27]. Unfortunately, comparatively fewer experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of spaceflight on monocot plant growth, morphology, and expression profiles. The wheat PESTO experiment investigated the growth of semi-dwarf wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. USU Apo) onboard the ISS relative to 1-g ground controls, demonstrating the existence of morphological differences between these two groups, including thinner leaves with ovoid chloroplasts and greater packaging density for microgravity-exposed plants relative to ground controls [13]. Similar phenotypes were also displayed by microgravity-exposed Zea mays plants [28]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cv. Koshihikari) grown for 68.5–136 h in the Space Shuttle STS-95 mission displayed longer roots than ground control, a phenotype associated with some thinning of the cell wall along with higher elasticity modulus and viscosity coefficient in space relative to ground controls [29]. Shagimardanova and colleagues analyzed the effects of microgravity on the transcriptome of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants growing in the Lada root module onboard the ISS [30]. They observed substantial transcriptomic differences between spaceflight and ground-control seedlings, including genes preferentially associated with stress response, pathogenesis, and antioxidant pathways [30]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) germinated and grown in a Science in Microgravity Box (SIMBOX) biological incubator on board the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft displayed dramatically altered photosynthesis characteristics with decreased photosystem 1 (PS1) efficiency relative to ground controls. This phenotype was associated with decreased abundance of proteins associated with the PS1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH), and cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) complexes. Hence, spaceflight may lead to declines in PSI activity in rice, either as a direct consequence of microgravity, or caused by side effects of spaceflight associated with inefficient airflow, high CO2 and ethylene levels, radiation, and/or other experimental parameters [31]. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment named APEX-06 (Advanced Plant Experiment-06) aimed at investigating the effect of spaceflight on the growth, morphology, and transcriptome profiles of Brachypodium distachyon, a genetic model for monocots closely related to cereal crops such as oat, wheat, barley, and rice [32]. We show that Brachypodium seedlings grown on the surface of foam substrates within modified Magenta-Box containers display accession-specific alterations in seedling organ growth onboard the ISS relative to ground controls. Surprisingly, exposure of Brachypodium to spaceflight conditions also triggered increased root-hair growth under our cultivation conditions, a phenotype that correlated with altered expression of key genes associated with ROS signaling and root-hair growth in one of the tested accessions. We also report dramatic differences in organ-specific transcriptomic responses to the spaceflight environment between Brachypodium accessions and discuss these observations within the context of monocot plant adaptation to spaceflight. Because a 1× g centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber utilized in these experiments, the growth and transcriptomic responses to spaceflight observed in this project may be the consequence of exposure to microgravity, radiation, or other spaceflight-associated parameters such as inefficient airflow and gas exchange, high ethylene levels, and/or other parameters.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. A Novel APEX Growth Unit Allows Transportation of Pre-Planted Dry Brachypodium distachyon Seeds to ISS and Subsequent Activation of Germination Experiments aimed at investigating the effects of microgravity environments on plant growth, development, and gene expression relative to ground controls should be conducted such that germination and growth occur under microgravity for the treated plants, avoiding any post-germination exposure to the 1-g conditions of Earth and/or hypergravity and vibration conditions typically experienced during takeoff and flight back to Earth. When using the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, seeds can be planted in agar-based media on the ground, then treated with far-red light followed by darkness to prevent germination during spaceflight [33]. Unfortunately, this far-red light pretreatment is not sufficient to block the germination of imbibed Brachypodium distachyon seeds before launch [34]. Therefore, we designed a novel foam-based growth system named the APEX Growth Unit, which can be planted with quiescent dry Brachypodium seeds on Earth, then transported to the ISS where the experiment can be activated by injecting growth medium into the foam. The APEX Growth Unit is made of a Magenta jar that contains a central Oasis Horticube foam whose general properties are described in the following link: https://oasisgrowersolutions.com/collections/horticubes%C2%AE (accessed on 6 February 2023) (Figure 1A) The foam block is wrapped with medical gauze and Nitex Mesch (Figure 1B) [35,36], and it is attached to an injection showerhead (Figure 1C). Surface-sterilized dry seeds are inserted in the foam before take-off, and germination is triggered by injection of sterile growth medium through the injection showerhead into the foam upon arrival on ISS. Plants growing on the surface of this foam block are contained within the Magenta jar, which maintains sterile conditions throughout the experiment. Several layers of medical gauze surrounding the nutrient-filled foam block assure better foam-to-root nutrient distribution during plant growth. Furthermore, a layer of Nitex mesh prevents roots from penetrating the foam block, assuring visibility of the root system throughout the experiment and facilitating root harvesting at the end of the growth period. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The APEX Growth Unit hardware. (A) The central Oasis Hortcube foam block (LC2, Oasis Grower Solutions) is used as a seed support during takeoff as well as following germination. It also serves as a nutrient reservoir during seedling growth. (B) The fully assembled APEX Growth Unit contains a foam block wrapped with a layer of medical gauze, allowing a more homogenous distribution of growth medium at the surface of the block where germinating seedlings are located. An outer layer of Nitex mesh prevents the roots of germinating seedlings from penetrating into the foam block, thereby hindering observation of their growth. (C) A growth-medium injection showerhead carries a central stick that serves as a support for a foam cube within the Magenta box. The injection showerhead is accessible for nutrient injection into the foam block through a port that crosses the Magenta box wall at its bottom. Black lines refer to 1 cm.To elucidate the effect of microgravity on Brachypodium seedling growth and expression profile, we grew three Brachypodium distachyon accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) under both microgravity and ground-control conditions. For each accession, four biological repeats per condition were carried out, each including one APEX Growth Unit (described in Section 2) planted with 28 seeds on the four surfaces of the foam block. A first group of 12 APEX Growth Units was flown to ISS, where astronaut Scott Tingle initiated the experiment by injecting nutrient medium into the foam of each unit and positioning the units into an onboard VEGGIE growth chamber following the blueprint shown in Supplemental Figure S1. This arrangement was designed to minimize differential exposure between accessions to the light gradients existing between the center and corners of the VEGGIE growth unit. After the first day of exposure to red light to synchronize germination, seedlings were grown under red, blue, and green light for a total period of 5 days. At the end of the growth period, seedlings were photographed, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater for subsequent RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis. A ground control was also carried out at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) with a two-day delay. This ground control mimicked the light, temperature, and CO2 conditions of the ISS experiment as well as the positions of the samples in VEGGIE. At the end of the growth period, ground control samples were photographed, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater following similar protocols as on ISS. 2.2. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Seeds of three Brachypodium distachyon accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) were obtained from Drs. Daniel Wood and Richard Amasino (University of Wisconsin–Madison). They were germinated and grown in soil (Berger Soil, BM2: Perlite: Vermiculite = 2:1:1) side-by-side in the same growth chamber exposed to a constant temperature of 22 °C, 65% relative humidity, 20 h day/4 h night cycles and 100–120 µmol/m2/s cool-white fluorescent light during the days. The plants were fertilized every other week with Blossom Booster Fertilizer (10-30-20). They were allowed to self-fertilize and generate seeds under these conditions. After harvesting, seeds were allowed to rest at room temperature for a minimum of three weeks to lift dormancy. At the time of the experiment, seeds were dehusked, surface-sterilized with five successive 1-min washes with 95% (w/v) ethanol, and then air-dried in a sterile hood for at least 20 min. Then, 24 seeds per APEX Growth Unit were inserted into the foam (6 per side), oriented with the embryo directed outward on the surface. Each accession was represented by a total of four APEX Growth Units (total of 96 seeds per accession). The seeded APEX Growth Units were packed in Cold Bags [37] held at 4 °C and transferred to the Dragon capsule on SpaceX-14 where they were stored for 3 days before launch. 2.3. ISS Experiment SpaceX-14 launched on 2 April 2018, and docked with the ISS ~2 days later. Twelve APEX Growth Units (4 per accession) were unpacked by astronaut Scott Tingle on 12 April 2018, and the experiment was activated by injection of 90 mL half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS: Sigma M5624 and MES: M2933) liquid medium into each APEX Growth Unit through the injection port (Figure 1). The APEX Growth Units were then integrated into the onboard VEGGIE (Vegetable Production System) growth unit fitted with Magenta-box holders following the pattern illustrated in Supplemental Figure S1 [38]. The red-LED lights were switched on to promote synchronized germination (low setting). After 24 h, the green and blue LED lights were also switched on (low setting) and the seedlings were allowed to grow for a period of 4 days under continuous light (blue, green, and red LEDs at an intensity of approximately 40–55 µmol/m2/s). HOBO environmental sensors/data loggers were placed into VEGGIE near the APEX Growth Units to capture the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) during the entire growth period. At the end of this growth period, seedlings were photographed with a Nikon D5 camera and then harvested into Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) preloaded with RNAlater (one KFT per APEX Growth Unit). Tissue fixation was initiated by forcing RNAlater from the storage chamber of the KFTs into the fixation chamber containing harvested plant tissue. Fixation proceeded at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The tubes were then stored in the Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer on the ISS (MELFI) for 20 days before being loaded onto the Dragon capsule and returned to Earth on 5 May 2018. The fixed samples were de-integrated from the KFTs and transferred into 50 mL Falcon Tubes at KSC, then delivered frozen at −80 °C to the Principal Investigator’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for molecular analysis. 2.4. Ground Control A duplicated set of APEX Growth Units planted with seeds from the same three accessions was generated and used for a ground control experiment that was carried out in a VEGGIE growth chamber within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES was programmed to simulate the environmental conditions recorded by the HOBO sensors in the VEGGIE unit of the ISS, with a 2-day delay. The four APEX Growth Units associated with each of the three accessions were positioned within VEGGIE along a pattern that was identical to the one used in the ISS experiment (Supplemental Figure S1). The experimental protocol for this ground control experiment was identical to the one followed on the ISS. At the end of the growth period, the seedlings were also photographed with a Nikon D4s camera, then harvested in KFTs and fixed in RNAlater as described for the ISS experiment. After 1-day fixation at room temperature, the samples were transferred to a −80 °C freezer, then sent to the Principle Investigator’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under dry ice for subsequent RNA extraction and expression analysis. 2.5. RNA Extraction and RNAseq Analysis Frozen fixed seedlings were thawed, then dissected to separate shoots and roots. Total RNA was extracted from the root or shoot tissues using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus extraction kits (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). DNAse-I treatment was performed in column using RNase-Free DNase-I Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA quality was monitored using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Eukaryotic total RNA NanoChip technologies (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Approximately 1 µg total RNA from each sample was used to generate cDNA libraries with rRNA reduction using TruSeq Stranded Total RNAlibrary Prep Plant Kits (lllumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Biotech Center DNA Sequencing Facility using NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were multiplexed with a target of ~60 million reads per sample for Bd21. For the other two accessions, Bd21-3 and Gaz8, RNA sequencing was performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (https://genelab.nasa.gov (accessed on 6 February 2023)) on a Illumina NovaSeq6000. Paired-end sequencing (2 × 100 bp) reactions were performed with ~120 million reads per sample. The corresponding sequencing fastq files have been uploaded into the GeneLab Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-375 (accessed on 6 February 2023); OSD-375; GLDS-375). 2.6. RNA Sequence Mapping and Transcriptional Profiling The Tuxedo pipeline was used to map RNAseq sequence reads to the Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 reference genome version 3.0 (Phytozome) [39]. Briefly, the paired-end 150-bp (Bd21) or 100-bp (Bd21-3 and Gaz8) sequence reads were joined after filtering out low-quality bases with Phred scores below 30. TopHat2 was then used to map the splice junctions between exons after aligning the reads to the Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 reference genome version 3.0 (Phytozome) using Bowtie2 as alignment engine; 2-bp mismatches were allowed in this step. The percentages of sequence reads aligned to the reference genome for each sample are summarized in Supplemental Table S1. The overall read mapping rate averaged 75% to 80%, except for one of the Gaz8 root samples in the ground control (B3 position), which displayed a mapping rate of 41.7%. Considering the lower mapping rate for this sample, we excluded it, along with the matched B3 Gaz8 flight sample, from subsequent analyses. HTseq was used to calculate the number of reads assigned to each annotated transcript. The DEseq [40] and EdgeR [41] R-based packages were used to normalize the data and evaluate differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control samples. Four biological replicates per accession were used to identify differentially expressed genes. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using either the Benjamin–Hochberg method (for DEseq) or the q-values set to false discovery rates (FDR) of 0.05 (for EdgeR). Thresholds for significant differences were set at p(q) < 0.05. 2.7. Bioinformatic Analysis, Annotation, and GO Enrichment of Differentially Expressed Genes Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated using the information available in Phytozome for Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 (Brachypodium distachyon Bd21 database, version 3.1; https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Bdistachyon_v3_1 (accessed on 6 February 2023)) [42]. Gene ontology enrichment analysis used the agriGO platform (http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). Singular enrichment analysis (SEA) was chosen for all enrichment analyses. Gene identification numbers (Bradi) associated with each annotated gene in Phytozome were directly used as input for all three accessions. For reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated DEGs, assignment to defined ROS-wheel categories was performed as defined in [43], using Arabidopsis orthologs to the Brachypodium DEGs as input. Predicted Arabidopsis orthologs to Brachypodium DEGs were obtained using Phytozome database (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Bdistachyon_v3_1 (accessed on 6 February 2023)). The threshold for significant enrichment was set at FDR = 0.05 [44,45]. For protein–protein interaction analysis, the STRING platform was used (https://string-db.org/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)) to identify potentially interacting DEG partners. GO enrichment and KEGG predictions were obtained directly from the STRING output [46]. For cis-acting element identification, we obtained the genomic sequence of the DEG’s transcribed region along with 5 kb of upstream and downstream sequences and used it as input data in the PLACE database to identify possible conserved cis-acting elements in proximity of each DEG (https://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE (accessed on 6 February 2023)) [47]. For transcription factor prediction and transcriptional regulation network analysis, Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot down-regulated DEGs belonging to the Photosynthesis GO group (GO:0015979) were identified and their Arabidopsis orthologs characterized. PlantRegMap (http://plantregmap.gao-lab.org/index.php (accessed on 6 February 2023)) was then used to search for possible transcription factors (TFs) regulating these DEGs [48]. This list of candidate TFs was compared to the full list of DEGs, allowing the identification of TFs that are differentially expressed in microgravity conditions relative to ground controls. These lists allowed us to reconstruct possible regulatory networks, which were manually drawn using Adobe Illustrator. 2.8. Morphology Measurement High-resolution seedling photographs (with scale) were taken on the ISS and in ground control experiments at the end of the growth period before tissue harvesting and fixation. Shoot and root lengths were measured separately using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). All germinated seedlings were measured for each accession (n > 68). For root-hair length, the resolution of the photographs was not sufficient to allow determination of hair sizes along each photographed root. Therefore, root-hair length was quantified on only a portion of the seedlings analyzed. For each image, all roots that did not overlap with other roots and whose root hairs were clearly defined and measurable were used. Root-hair length was measured in a region of the root located approximately 3 cm above the root tip, within the mature zone, where the root hairs have reached full-length (n > 10 roots for each accession and growth condition). Student’s t-test with 2-tailed distributions and equal variances was used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences (p < 0.05), using Microsoft Excel. 2.9. qRT-PCR Analysis 1 μg total mRNA per sample was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the qScript cDNA SuperMix and following a protocol recommended by the supplier (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA, USA). Then, 250 ng RNA-equivalent cDNA was used to perform RT-qPCR per reaction. The RT-qPCR reactions (250 ng cDNA, 0.2 μM primers, and 1× Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix; MidSci, St. Louis, MO, USA) were run on a LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Gene expression was calculated using the delta-Ct approach, and the data were standardized to the UBC18 (Bradi4g00660) reference gene [49]. All flight expression levels were standardized to ground control levels. Student’s t-test with 2-tailed distributions and equal variances was used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences between samples (p < 0.05), using Microsoft Excel (version 2009).",

Microgravity Affects Seedling Growth in an Accession-Specific Manner In a first attempt to evaluate the effect of the microgravity environment of ISS on Brachypodium seedlings, we investigated the direction of root and shoot growth after five days of cultivation on ISS and a ground control at KSC, and quantified shoot and root growth from pictures taken at the end of the growth period under both conditions. Seedlings grown under microgravity showed more variation in shoot and root growth direction than those grown on the ground (Figure 2A), as expected considering the absence of gravi-response under microgravity. However, seedling organs were not randomly oriented. Shoots generally grew toward the light canopy whereas roots tended to grow away from it (Figure 2A). These directional growth trends may be partly due to the original orientation of the seeds embedded into the foam. However, phototropism may also offer directional guidance under microgravity. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Brachypodium distachyon seedlings display accession-specific morphological alterations in the microgravity environment of ISS relative to ground controls. Accessions include Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8. (A) Representative 5-day-old Brachypodium seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions grown on the ISS (upper panel) and on Earth (lower) panel). Biometric analysis of (B) root length and (C) shoot length of 5-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings from the Bd21 (n > 69), Bd21-3 (n > 68), and Gaz8 (n > 68) accessions. (D) Close-up view of representative roots of 5-day-old Gaz8 seedlings, showing differences in root-hair lengths between microgravity-exposed (left) and ground-control (right) seedlings. Representative root-hair length measurement is marked in the red line. (E) Quantitative measurement of root hair sizes between microgravity-grown and ground-control 5-day-old seedlings from the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions. Based on the resolution of the images, each root was measured once in the root mature zone from the root hair tip to the approximate root epidermal layer (n > 10). In B, C, and E, t-tests were used to determine the significance (* p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; n > 10).Morphologically, microgravity-exposed seedling roots were 16% to 18% shorter than ground controls for all three accessions tested at the end of the growth period (Figure 2B). For shoots, we only saw a 20% reduction of growth under microgravity for Bd21, whereas Bd21-3 and Gaz8 shoots grew similarly under both conditions (Figure 2C). In addition to observing differences in root and shoot growth under microgravity relative to ground controls, we also noticed a clear root-hair phenotype associated with growth under microgravity conditions. Indeed, the roots of microgravity-grown Brachypodium seedlings of all accessions were hairier than those grown on earth, at least for areas of the roots in direct contact with the feeding-block surface (Figure 2D). Unfortunately, we could not determine if this hairy-root phenotype was associated with increased root-hair density under microgravity. However, representative images from seedlings of all accessions tested were of sufficient resolution to allow the measurement of root-hair sizes. In all cases, root hairs were significantly longer on microgravity-exposed seedlings than ground controls (Figure 2D,E). Overall, these results suggest the existence of genetic variation between Brachypodium accessions for seedling growth responses to microgravity. 3.2. Microgravity-Exposed Seedling Roots and Shoots Display Distinct Transcriptomic Profiles Compared to Ground Controls To evaluate the impact of spaceflight on gene expression, we compared the transcriptome profiles between microgravity conditions (ISS) and ground controls for dissected Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 Brachypodium distachyon seedling roots and shoots using the DEseq and EdgeR statistical packages. Candidate genes identified by both packages as displaying significant differences in expression between microgravity and ground control conditions are discussed below. The three Brachypodium accessions tested in APEX-06 showed distinguishable expression responses to the microgravity environment of ISS. A total of 1027 and 325 genes were found to be differentially expressed (DEGs) between microgravity-exposed and ground-control conditions in shoots and roots, respectively, for Bd21, which is the accession traditionally used as a reference in Brachypodium genome sequencing projects (Figure 3A,B; Supplemental Table S2). Bd21-3, on the other hand, displayed fewer DEGs under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, including 345 DEGs in shoots and 224 in roots (Supplemental Table S3). For Gaz8, 4186 and 475 genes were differentially expressed in shoots and roots (Supplemental Table S4), respectively (Figure 3A,B). This implies that different Brachypodium accessions may have distinct abilities to adapt to the microgravity environment of ISS based on the dramatic differences in expression responses to microgravity they displayed in this experiment. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcriptome analysis of Brachypodium seedlings grown under the microgravity environment of ISS and ground control. (A,B) Venn diagram summarizing the numbers of genes showing differential expression in roots (A) and shoots (B) between microgravity conditions and ground control for the three Brachypodium accessions analyzed here (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8). Genes showing statistically significant differences between these two conditions using two statistical packages (DESeq and EdgeR) are reported here. (C) Numbers of genes showing significant increases (red upward arrows), decreases (green downward arrows), or no change (horizontal black bar) in expression between microgravity and ground-control conditions in shoots and roots of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions.Within each accession, very few DEGs were found to overlap between shoots and roots. In fact, a vast majority of DEGs were differentially expressed in only shoots or roots (Figure 3C). This observation held true for all accessions tested in this study. When comparing accessions, only 46 and four DEGs were found to be shared by all three accessions in shoots and roots, respectively. We define these genes as common DEGs (Supplemental Table S5). The common DEGs share several interesting features. First, most of these common DEGs display expression changes in the same direction (up or down) under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in all three accessions (with only one exception in the shoot samples). This observation may suggest that the common DEGs represent a significant component of plant responses to the microgravity conditions on ISS. Second, we performed a GO enrichment analysis of these common DEGs, using their Arabidopsis orthologues as queries. While the list of common root DEGs was too small to warrant such an analysis, we noticed an enrichment of the list of down-regulated common shoot DEGs for genes associated with the Photosynthesis (GO:0015979; FDR = 8.6 × 10−9), Photosynthesis/Light Reaction (GO:0019684; FDR = 7.4 × 10−7), and Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy (GO:0006091; FDR = 6.3 × 10−5) GO groups. All these GO groups belong to the Photosynthesis-Related hierarchy (Supplemental Table S5). This observation is consistent with previous studies in Arabidopsis [50] and rice [31], and also with our observation discussed in the following section that photosynthesis-related Gene Ontologies (GOs) are enriched in the general lists of down-regulated shoot DEGs in all three accessions (Supplemental Figure S4). Third, several common DEGs found in our list encode cell-wall-related proteins, including two up-regulated wall-associated kinases (WAKs) in shoots and one up-regulated laccase and one down-regulated peroxidase in roots (Supplemental Table S5). This is also consistent with previous studies in rice or Arabidopsis, indicating differential expression of genes associated with cell wall composition and/or extensibility under microgravity conditions [22,51,52,53]. 3.3. GO Enrichment Analysis Suggests That Brachypodium Roots and Shoots Deploy Distinct Biological Strategies to Cope with the Microgravity Environment on ISS To understand the biological processes that may be affected by the microgravity environment, we analyzed our list of DEGs for possible GO enrichments. First, we split the DEG list into four categories for each accession based on their up- or down-regulation in root and shoot tissues, respectively. Figure 4 shows the list of GO groups over-represented in Bd21. Among all four categories, DEGs are enriched for genes associated with the Oxidation-Reduction Process (GO: 0055114) (Figure 4). However, the DEGs belonging to this GO group were distinct between shoot and root tissues (Supplemental Table S6). In the root down-regulated category, most DEGs belong to the peroxidase and cytochrome P450 super families. On the other end, only a few peroxidases were identified in the shoot down-regulated category. Instead, this category contained more photosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, seven peroxidase genes were observed in shoot up-regulated DEGs (Supplemental Table S6), indicating opposite peroxidase expression trends between root and shoot tissues under the microgravity environment for Bd21. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs from 5-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21 accession exposed to microgravity conditions of ISS relative to ground-control conditions. All DEGs from Bd21 are split into four categories based on tissue (root/shoot) and expression regulation under microgravity relative to ground control (up/down): (A) root down-regulated DEGs, (B) root up-regulated DEGs, (C) shoot down-regulated DEGs, and (D) shoot up-regulated DEGs. Enrichment significance is represented by both FDR numbers and color shading, with darker red representing smaller FDR values. Blue bars represent expected values (total number of genes representing the GO group divided by the total number of genes in the genome), whereas yellow bars represent observed ratios (number of DEGs belonging to the GO group divided by the total number of DEGs). The GO groups are arranged along a hierarchical tree of biological processes. The original information was generated by using the agriGO website (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). The singular enrichment analysis (SEA) method was used to calculate significance. * refers to the GO groups that belong to two or more different hierarchies and are repeated in the table to better represent the hierarchies.Next, we expanded our GO enrichment analysis to DEGs identified in all three accessions analyzed in this project. Interestingly, the Oxidation-Reduction process (GO: 0055114) was found to be the only GO group enriched in all four categories of DEGs for all three accessions, reemphasizing the importance of the Oxidation-Reduction process in Brachypodium seedling responses to the microgravity environment on ISS (Supplemental Figures S2–S5). Previous studies have shown that transcriptomic responses to a variety of redox homeostasis perturbation experiments in Arabidopsis cluster into eight main groups (the “ROS wheel”), each showing similar patterns of expression changes in response to distinct classes of perturbations [43]. Because our study revealed that the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group is significantly enriched in the Brachypodium shoot and root transcriptomic responses to the microgravity environment on ISS, we compared our list of DEGs from Bd21 to the clusters identified in the ROS wheel. To do this, we used “best-hit annotation” (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html (accessed on 6 February 2023)) to identify Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs. From the 325 Bd21 root DEGs identified in our study, 296 have Arabidopsis orthologs, including 259 with unique orthologs. Further, 883 of the 1027 shoot DEGs were also found to have Arabidopsis orthologs, including 797 with unique orthologs (Supplemental Table S7 and S8). The lists of Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs were then compared to the lists of core genes associated with each cluster within the ROS wheel (Figure 5, Supplemental Table S9). Of the core genes identified in cluster I of the ROS wheel, 55% were orthologous to Bd21 shoot DEGs in our experiment. This result suggests that Brachypodium Bd21 shoots display expression responses to the microgravity environment on ISS that are similar to those displayed by Arabidopsis plants exposed to redox perturbations associated with defects in the GUN retrograde signaling pathway [54]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis orthologs to Brachypodium root and shoot DEGs with ROS-signaling annotation preferentially associate with specific transcriptional response clusters from the ROS wheel (Willems et al. (2016)). Clusters I-VIII refer to the categories of ROS-related experiments used to establish clusters of transcriptional responses in the ROS wheel meta-analysis. Bars represent the total number of genes present in each cluster. The proportions of genes present in a specific cluster that are also orthologous to specific microgravity-related Brachypodium DEGs (from this study) are represented in yellow.We performed a similar analysis in the Bd21-3 and Gaz8 accessions (Figure 5; Supplemental Table S9). Arabidopsis orthologs to Bd21-3 shoot DEGs associated with ROS signaling clustered preferentially with group-3 of the ROS wheel, representing early responses to high-light conditions, although this association did not reach statistical significance (chi-squared test; p = 0.54). For Gaz8, Arabidopsis orthologs to shoot DEGs preferentially clustered with both groups 1 and 3 of the ROS wheel (Figure 5; chi-squared test; p = 9.79 × 10−11). Together, these puzzling results suggest the existence of accession-specific responses to oxidative stress under microgravity conditions possibly triggered by differential organ sensitivities to distinct microgravity environment-related stimuli. Our results also suggest that Brachypodium seedlings grown under microgravity condition may use the retrograde signaling pathway to modulate their responses to the microgravity-related stressors and acclimate accordingly. 3.4. Brachypodium Genes Associated with Photosynthesis Are Down-Regulated under Microgravity Conditions on ISS As mentioned in the previous sections, the oxidation-reduction process is important for Brachypodium seedlings growing under microgravity condition. When we compared the ROS wheel with our DEG lists, cluster I from the ROS wheel was significantly enriched within the Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot DEGs (Figure 5). Cluster I is enriched with photosynthesis-related genes [43]. Therefore, these results match our observation that Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot down-regulated DEGs are enriched with photosynthesis-related GO groups (GO.: 0015979, GO: 0019684, GO:0006091) (Supplemental Figure S4). This observation is also consistent with previous reports from Arabidopsis [50,55] and rice [31]. To understand the possible regulatory pathways leading to the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related Brachypodium genes under microgravity conditions, we sought transcription factors whose annotations predict a contribution to expression regulation of the photosynthesis-related DEGs in Bd21. Unfortunately, analyses using the Brachypodium and rice transcription-factor databases (http://plantregmap.gao-lab.org/index.php (accessed on 6 February 2023)) were not sufficiently robust to identify significant DEG expression regulators. Therefore, we used the Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs to search for possible regulatory networks. In the Arabidopsis genome, a total of 252 genes are annotated as associated with the photosynthesis GO group (GO:0015979). Among them, 99 were orthologous to genes within our DEG list. We used these 99 DEG orthologs as input to retrieve 29 candidate transcription factors that are predicted to regulate these DEGs in Arabidopsis. Brachypodium orthologs to these candidate regulatory transcription factor genes were then identified and compared to our list of DEGs in the Bd21 accession (Supplemental Table S10). This analysis allowed us to build the predicted regulatory networks connecting transcription factor genes associated with photosynthesis-related Bd21-DEG orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 6). Several short linear pathways were identified amongst the dow-regulated DEG orthologs (Figure 6A). On the other end, a more complex, branched regulatory network could be built connecting numerous up-regulated DEG orthologs (Figure 6B). Within this up-regulated network, one pathway has been more thoroughly investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, involving the PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR1 (PIF1, also named PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3-LIKE5; PIL5; At2g20180/Bradi5g21950) (Supplemental Figure S6, surrounded by an orange line). This transcription factor preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB) to modulate light effects in plants. Interestingly, the Phytochrome A (PHYA; Bradi1g10520) was also up-regulated in response to the microgravity environment in Brachypodium Bd21 shoots (Supplemental Table S2). Furthermore, up-regulation of PIF1 was previously reported to inhibit photomorphogenesis-related processes in several plant species, including chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in Arabidopsis [56,57,58,59]. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis transcriptional regulation networks involving transcription factors predicted to regulate DEG orthologs associated with the Photosynthesis GO group in Bd21. Orthologs to down-regulated (A) and up-regulated (B) transcription factors are shown in this figure. Nodes refer to the transcription factors and arrows indicate the direction of transcription regulation. Green represents down-regulation under microgravity whereas pink refers to up-regulation. Genes that are also orthologous to Gaz8 DEGs are surrounded by a blue circle with the same expression pattern. A regulatory pathway involving the PIF1 gene is surrounded by a yellow outline. See Supplemental Figure S6 for a more detailed description of the PIF1 regulatory network including target genes orthologous to Brachypodium DEGs.To evaluate a possible effect of microgravity-induced activation of expression of the Brachypodium PIF1-ortholog on the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and processes in Bd21 shoots, we compared our list of Arabidopsis orthologs to the Bd21 shoot DEGs with a list of PIF1/4/5- (PIF-trio) and PIF3-regulated genes in Arabidopsis (obtained from Supplemental Tables S9 and S10 of Zhang et al., 2013 [60]). Supplemental Table S11 shows a total of 88 Brachypodium shoot DEGs (64 down-regulated and 24 up-regulated DEGs) whose Arabidopsis orthologs are either AtPIF1/4/5 (PIFtrio)- and/or AtPIF3-regulated genes, with similar patterns (directions) of expression changes. This list of putative PIF-regulated genes is strongly enriched for photosynthesis-related GO groups (GO: 0015979, GO:0006091, and GO:0009765…etc.), as expected (p ≤ 7.6 × 10−29). To confirm the differential expression of these potential Brachypodium PIF-target genes under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, we used a RT-qPCR approach to quantify the expression of both PHYA (Bradi1g10520) and PIF1 (Bradi5g21950) along with four randomly picked DEGs from the list of Brachypodium orthologs to Arabidopsis PIF-response genes (Bradi3g07190, Bradi4g30060, Bradi2g16290, and Bradi1g1213). Results shown in Supplemental Figure S7 demonstrate a significant up-regulation of both PHYA (Bradi1g10520; 5-fold) and PIF1 (Bradi5g21950; 7-fold) in Bd21 under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls. It also demonstrates a down-regulation of all four DEGs under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, in agreement with our RNAseq results. Taken together, our results suggest that up-regulation of PHYA and PIF-gene expression under microgravity correlates with the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in Brachypodium Bd21 shoots. Considering that Brachypodium is only distantly related to Arabidopsis, it will be important to directly test this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of Bradi5g21950 activation on expression regulation and photosynthesis related processes in Brachypodium distachyon. While our hypothesis of a role for Bradi5g21950 (Brachypodium PIF1 ortholog) and Bradi1g10520 (PHYA) in mediating the effect of microgravity on photosynthesis-related processes in Bd21 seems reasonable, the situation for Gaz8 may be more complex. Indeed, in Gaz8, seedling exposure to the microgravity environment on ISS appeared to either not affect or down-regulate the expression of PHYA and PIF-related genes (Supplemental Table S4). Furthermore, an analysis of photosynthesis-related Gaz8 DEGs identified 102 transcription factor genes as differentially expressed in Gaz8 under microgravity conditions. Yet, only six of these photosynthesis-related Gaz8 transcription factor DEGs were similar to those discussed above for Bd21 (Figure 6, blue circles). We conclude that another, yet unknown, mechanism may be responsible for regulating expression of photosynthesis-related genes in Gaz8. Whether such an alternative regulatory mechanism may also function, at least partially, in the regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in Bd21 and/or Bd21-3, remains unknown. 3.5. Genes Annotated as Potential Contributors to Transcriptional and Post-Translational Regulation Are Up-Regulated in Microgravity-Grown Bd21 and Gaz8 Shoots In addition to the GO groups associated with plant responses to oxidative stress or photosynthesis discussed in the previous section, we noticed that two main hierarchies of GO groups associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated (GO:0006355) and Protein Modification (GO:0036211) are enriched in the microgravity up-regulated shoot DEGs in both Bd21 and Gaz8 accessions (Supplemental Figures S5). The DEGs associated with these two GO groups are listed in Supplemental Tables S12 and S13. In Bd21, 23 DEGs are associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated (GO:0006355). Annotation of best-hit Arabidopsis and rice orthologs to these DEGs suggests that most of them encode transcription factors [42] (Supplemental Table S12). Four of them are predicted to encode ethylene response-element binding proteins or ERFs (Bradi2g27920, Bradi3g18070, Bradi3g38140, and Bradi2g22505), suggesting activation of the ethylene signaling pathway; another two of these transcription factors have been associated with ABA signaling (Bradi2g45000, and Bradi2g45567), potentially contributing to the plant space–stress mitigation. Within the DEGs associated with the Protein Modification GO group (GO:0036211), the Phytochrome A (Bradi1g10520) gene discussed in the previous section may be an important modulator of plant responses to the microgravity environment of ISS. Additionally, 26 out of 31 DEGs associated with this GO group encode kinases. Of them, 15 are annotated as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs), including one annotated as brassinosteroid-receptor kinase-like protein (BRL1) (Supplemental Table S13). It is worth noting that RLKs have been shown to contribute to plant responses to biotic and abiotic stressors as well as cell development [61,62,63]. Finally, this list of DEGs associated with GO:0036211 also includes several wall-associated protein kinase (WAKs) genes. Proteins belonging to this group straddle the plasma membrane, connecting the wall with the cytoplasm. Their extracellular domain has been shown to interact with both proteins and pectins in the cell wall whereas their cytoplasmic segment contains a kinase domain that transduces information derived from wall integrity, pathogen invasion, cell shape, deformation, and mechanostimulation, into cellular responses. Microgravity-induced expression of such wall associated protein kinase genes was also reported in Arabidopsis thaliana [64]. In Gaz8, 112 up-regulated shoot DEGs are associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated GO group (GO:0006355) and 147 are associated with the Protein Modification group (GO: 0036211) (Supplemental Tables S12 and S13). As in Bd21, multiple ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs) are present in this list of shoot up-regulated DEGs. A couple of auxin response factor genes are also present in this list, as are several WRKY genes not found in the list of differentially expressed DEGs in accession Bd21 (Supplemental Table S12). The list of Gaz8-up-regulated DEGs associated with Protein Modification (GO:0036211) includes a majority of genes annotated as kinases, including three that encode kinases associated with the brassinosteroid signaling pathway and several WAKs, as also observed in Bd21. Additionally, this list also includes a large group of genes that encode calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, which are not differentially expressed in Bd21. This is noteworthy because calcium and calmodulin have been suggested to play important roles in gravity signal transduction and mechanotransduction in Arabidopsis [65]. Finally, the list of up-regulated shoot DEGs associated with GO:0036211 also includes several genes that encode kinases associated with the mitogen-activated kinase cascades, which have been reported to contribute to multiple signaling pathways, including those responding to abiotic and biotic stressors as well as hormonal signaling and developmental regulation [66,67,68]. 3.6. Genes Associated with the “Translation” GO Group (GO:0006412) Are Down-Regulated in Gaz8 Shoots and Roots under the Microgravity Environment on ISS As discussed in the previous sections of this manuscript, the three accessions of Brachypodium distachyon we tested showed both common and accession-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity, with the latter group predominating. In Gaz8, we noticed a significant association of down-regulated shoot and root DEGs with GO groups related to translation (GO:0006412; Supplemental Table S14), which was not observed in either Bd21 or Bd21-3 accessions. A majority of these genes encode proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis. Previous studies in rice and Arabidopsis have suggested ribosome biogenesis as an index of cell growth and proliferation in cell cultures [69,70]. Whether this microgravity-associated decrease in expression of ribosome biogenesis-related genes can explain the short-root phenotype displayed by Gaz8 seedlings grown on ISS remains unknown. Unfortunately, our experimental set-up did not allow quantification of root tip cell size and numbers of meristematic cells in the root apical meristem. 3.7. Root Hair Growth Is Enhanced under Microgravity Conditions As discussed in the first section of results, seedlings grown under microgravity environment carried longer root hairs compared to ground controls. In an attempt to better understand the molecular mechanisms that govern this phenotype, we investigated the possibility that some root DEGs might be candidate root-hair growth regulators. Unfortunately, there is no published root-hair specific transcription profile in Brachypodium. Therefore, we identified both Arabidopsis and rice orthologs to root microgravity-related DEGs and then verified if any of the orthologs to these root-specific DEGs are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis and/or rice root hairs [14,71,72]. Starting with rice, this analysis revealed the existence of 19 Bd21 DEGs whose rice orthologs are preferentially expressed in rice root hairs [72]. Unfortunately, only one of these candidate DEGs was up-regulated in Bd21 under microgravity (Bradi3g20045), the remaining 18 being down-regulated (Supplemental Table S15). We then investigated whether Arabidopsis orthologs to the Brachypodium root DEGs are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis root hairs using the microarray data set published in Lan et al., 2013 [71]. Eighteen of the Bd21 root DEGs identified in this study have Arabidopsis orthologs that are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis root-hair cells with similar expression trends (Supplemental Table S16). Similar comparisons involving Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 accessions identified 11 and 138 DEGs, respectively, with Arabidopsis orthologs showing similar patterns of differential expression in root hair cells [71]. None of these root-hair associated DEGs were identified as differentially expressed in all three accessions. However, Brachypodium orthologs to the Arabidopsis PIN2 gene (At5g57090), which encodes an auxin efflux carrier family protein recently shown to play an important role in root-hair development [73,74,75], were shown to be down-regulated in Brachypodium in response to the microgravity environment (Bradi2g52640 for Bd21 and Bd21-3 and Bradi1g31530 for Gaz8; Supplemental Table S16). Unfortunately, there is to date no evidence that a knock-down mutation of PIN2 will cause a longer root-hair phenotype. Therefore, we currently have no clear molecular explanation for the long root-hair phenotype displayed by Brachypodium seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS. An opposite root-hair response to microgravity has been reported for Arabidopsis seedlings (shorter root hairs relative to ground controls) [14]. It should however be cautioned that root-hair growth and development are highly sensitive to a variety of environmental and hormonal constraints such as water, nutrients and oxygen availability, mechanical perturbations, pH and ROS status, exposure to ethylene, etc. [76,77,78]. Importantly, the hardware and experimental designs used in the Arabidopsis study discussed in reference [14] and our Brachypodium experiment differ significantly in several respects. For instance, our Brachypodium seedlings were grown in foam-based APEX Growth Units with constant light exposure, while Kwon et al. grew their Arabidopsis seedlings in agar-based media inside the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware under complete darkness. The differences in seedling growth conditions between these two experiments could explain, at least partly, the differences in root-hair responses to microgravity.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In this paper, we describe the morphological and transcriptomic changes displayed by the seedlings of three Brachypodium distachyon accessions in response to the microgravity conditions of ISS relative to ground controls. Microgravity-exposed seedlings of all three accessions displayed shorter roots than ground controls, a phenotype that was previously reported for other plant species such as Cress [79], wheat [80], and Arabidopsis [16]. It is however important to note that a decrease in primary root length in response to microgravity is not a general plant response, as other reports have indicated increases in root length for microgravity-exposed seedlings in flax, rice, and soybean [29,81,82,83,84]. The reasons for such variations in root growth responses to microgravity are not known, although differences in genotypes and growth conditions may be responsible. Some of the gene-expression responses to the microgravity environments uncovered in this study may provide some clues, though. Indeed, genes annotated as regulating cell wall extensibility such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (Bradi1g27867) and expansins (Bradi1g74720, Bradi3g50740, Bradi3g50730, and Bradi3g27440), were down-regulated in Bd21 Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions (Supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, knockout mutations in Arabidopsis orthologs to these genes have been reported to restrict cell wall extensibility and limit cell expansion and root elongation [85,86]. Similarly, we observed a tendency for many ribosomal-related genes to decrease in expression in Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in Gaz8 accession (Supplemental Table S13). Previous studies using Arabidopsis cell cultures demonstrated a correlation between ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth, observing a depletion in both processes under both microgravity conditions or simulated microgravity [69,70]. Unfortunately, our experiments were not set up to allow observation of cell numbers in the root apical meristem, or cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the short-root phenotype displayed by Brachypodium seedlings exposed to microgravity derive from decreased cell proliferation in the root apical meristem or altered cell elongation in the elongation zone. Our transcriptomic analysis of Brachypodium responses to the microgravity environment on the ISS differentiated between shoot and root responses. This allowed us to demonstrate dramatic differences in expression responses between shoots and roots for all three Brachypodium accessions analyzed. In fact, only 3% of the DEGs identified in this study were similarly differentially expressed between root and shoot samples. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis of these DEGs uncovered distinct major GO groups as enriched in shoot and root DEGs, respectively. The few GO groups that were similarly over-represented between shoot and root DEGs included genes that showed opposite expression responses to the microgravity environment between organs, as nicely documented by the expression differences between shoots and roots for distinct subgroups of peroxidase genes belonging to the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group in Bd21 (Supplemental Figure S6). These results are compatible with those reported for Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings exposed to microgravity [6]. They suggest that the roots and shoots of young Brachypodium or Arabidopsis seedlings develop distinct response strategies to cope with the constraints dictated by exposure to the microgravity environment on ISS. Alternatively, it is also possible that the roots and shoots of young seedlings exposed to microgravity are subject to different environmental constraints imposed by their distinct functional contributions to plant development. Similar models can be proposed to explain the vastly distinct transcriptional responses to microgravity displayed by the three Brachypodium accessions analyzed in this study. These accessions evolved under distinct conditions in different ecosystems within the Mediterranean area [87]. The varying selective pressures they encountered during their evolutionary history led to distinct genotypes that likely favored their adaptation to their native environment. When transferred to a new environment such as the microgravity conditions on the ISS, plants belonging to distinct accessions are differentially equipped to respond to these new constraints, leading to diverging root and shoot expression profiles along with differential growth and/or morphological responses. Larger-scale investigations of root and shoot growth and expression responses to microgravity of multiple Brachypodium accessions using genome-wide association studies should, in the longer term, provide exciting new information on key loci contributing to this variation in morphological and molecular adaptive responses to microgravity. Plants have been identified as key components of bioregenerative life-support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. This is in large part due to their ability to photosynthesize, thereby recycling CO2 and wastewater to produce O2, carbohydrates, and other biological molecules necessary for plant growth and development. The resulting biomass will constitute a significant source of food, feed, and fiber for the crew. Our data indicate that many photosynthesis-related genes are down-regulated in Brachypodium seedling shoots under microgravity conditions. We showed that such transcriptional responses of photosynthesis-related genes to the microgravity environment of ISS may be associated with oxidative stress exposure leading to an activation of the GUS retrograde signaling pathway and/or activation of PIF gene expression. It is interesting to note that hypergravity exposure, which leads to a strengthening of the cell wall, has recently been associated with increased chloroplast size, photosynthesis, and plant growth in moss, possibly reflecting a source–sink link between photosynthesis and carbohydrate utilization in cell wall restructuring [88]. Furthermore, Arabidopsis PIF proteins have been shown to directly bind to the LAZY4 promoter, thereby activating its expression and modulating the gravitropic response [89]. Therefore, future work will focus on investigating possible mechanistic connections between gravity and microgravity exposure, retrograde signaling between plastids and nucleus, PIF-mediated signaling, photosynthesis, wall restructuring, and carbohydrate metabolism. In conclusion, our morphological and transcriptomic study of space-grown Brachypodium seedlings provides new insights into monocot plant responses to spaceflight. Because a 1× g centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber, the responses to spaceflight observed in this project cannot be unambiguously assigned to microgravity exposure. Indeed, some of these responses may also result from exposure to other spaceflight-associated parameters such as radiation, inefficient airflow, high ethylene levels, and/or other experimental parameters. Some of the responses to spaceflight displayed by Brachypodium distachyon seedlings are similar to those from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, including oxidative stress response, decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and wall restructuring. Those types of general responses also appear to be common between Brachypodium distachyon accessions. We also observed some transcriptional responses to microgravity conditions that are more specific to Brachypodium distachyon accessions, suggesting a specificity of response that may be expected from plant populations that have been subjected to distinct evolutionary constraints and are now subjected to a totally new environment (microgravity). Our studies focused on the early stages of seedling development, and it will be important to evaluate the contribution of the identified responses to spaceflight at later phases of plant development and reproduction. A careful evaluation of the contribution of each response, general or specific, to the microgravity environment and its significance for plant survival, growth, and productivity under microgravity should lead to the design of better cultivars and/or cultivation methodologies to produce crops with improved potential for use as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. Furthermore, the existence of distinct molecular responses to the microgravity environment between species, and between accessions within species, suggests the need to expand these types of studies directly to cultivated crop species of potential use during spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 10058394 PMID: 36983782 Abstract Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

Introduction On Earth, plants are exposed to a unidirectional 1-g force that guides the growth of their organs (gravitropism). Furthermore, the weight imposed by gravity on each organ results in a mechanical load that must be counteracted by thick, sturdy cell walls and specialized morphologies. Millions of years of evolution on Earth have assured the effectiveness of these gravitropic, gravi-resistance, and gravimorphogenesis processes, allowing plants to grow and develop properly, forming morphologies that effectively permit completion of their life cycle [1]. Spaceflight, on the other hand, imposes very different constraints on the plants, which they never encountered during their evolution on Earth. During spaceflight, the directional cue provided by gravity is insufficient to modulate gravitropism, gravi-resistance, and other directional cues within the environment. Therefore other tropisms have to take over and guide plant organ growth, including light, gradients in water, oxygen, temperature, ions, and chemicals [2,3]. Similarly, the weightlessness associated with microgravity exposure implies a lack of weight-bearing on plant organs, leading to different mechanical constraints on their growth behaviors [1,4]. Other critical alterations of the physical environment encountered by plants during spaceflight include a lack of gravity-induced convection resulting in diminished gas exchange at the surface of the plant, altered photosynthesis, respiration, hypoxia, and thermoregulation [1,2,5,6,7,8]. Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [9]. Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named “space syndrome”. These include shorter organs, thinner leaves, roots tending to grow away from the light source (negative phototropism) while also skewing in some cases, root hairs of altered size, modified organelle size and shape, altered metabolism, and accumulation of starch, to cite only a few [10,11,12,13,14]. Researchers have heavily relied on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to reveal key molecular pathways that are responsive to the spaceflight environment relative to ground controls. Experiments using mostly Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings or plant tissue cultures as experimental materials have revealed potential contributions of Ca2+, light and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, cell wall remodeling, and defense responses in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment [6,8,10,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Some of these expression changes were accompanied by alterations in the pattern of CNG and CNN DNA methylation in the proximity of the corresponding genes, suggesting some epigenetic contribution to the process [24]. Interestingly, a short root-hair phenotype displayed by Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the BRIC hardware onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) was accompanied by decreased expression of genes associated with oxidative stress (such as peroxidases) and cell wall remodeling, and reverse genetics demonstrated a contribution of some of these genes in modulation of root hair growth [14]. The profiling investigations described above have revealed a large variability in expression responses between experiments due in part to differences in hardware used to grow the plants, growth conditions, and plant genotypes (reviewed in [25]). The latter parameter (plant genotype) is particularly interesting to consider. Indeed, the geographical origin of a specific plant accession plays a key role in defining the type of responses the plant will develop under specific environmental conditions, reflecting an important role for selective forces in dictating the evolution of adaptive traits. Consequently, for any plant species, individual ecotypes carry specific sets of alleles that allowed the plants to not only survive and adapt to the conditions of their native environment, but also result in distinct abilities to cope with new environments to which they might subsequently become exposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments attempting to evaluate Arabidopsis’s ability to adapt to the microgravity environment have revealed dramatic accession-specific differences in their ability to grow, develop, and respond molecularly to this novel environment. In fact, most experiments aimed at investigating Arabidopsis transcriptional responses to spaceflight have been carried out using the Col ecotype at the seedling stage [10,14,15,20,26] or as cell cultures [18,21]. Additionally, transcriptomic responses to spaceflight of Ler-0 and Ws ecotypes have been investigated in multiple space environments such as in Space Shuttles [8] and the International Space Station (ISS) [17,22], using a variety of hardware such as the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS: [10,15]) or the CARA experiment [16], respectively. More recently, a landmark paper described a more thorough comparative transcriptomic analysis of four Arabidopsis ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0) exposed to either microgravity conditions or 1-g [6]. Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that different accessions display both common and accession-specific responses to the microgravity environment relative to ground controls. Shared transcriptomic responses included the activation of expression of molecular chaperones that may protect the cells against oxidative damage imposed by the hypoxic conditions that typically develop around plant organs in the absence of convective buoyancy under microgravity [6]. While Arabidopsis thaliana serves as an outstanding genetic model for investigations of dicot plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight, most major agriculture crops grown on Earth for food, feed, and fiber are monocots, which diverged from the dicots ~150 million years ago [27]. Unfortunately, comparatively fewer experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of spaceflight on monocot plant growth, morphology, and expression profiles. The wheat PESTO experiment investigated the growth of semi-dwarf wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. USU Apo) onboard the ISS relative to 1-g ground controls, demonstrating the existence of morphological differences between these two groups, including thinner leaves with ovoid chloroplasts and greater packaging density for microgravity-exposed plants relative to ground controls [13]. Similar phenotypes were also displayed by microgravity-exposed Zea mays plants [28]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cv. Koshihikari) grown for 68.5–136 h in the Space Shuttle STS-95 mission displayed longer roots than ground control, a phenotype associated with some thinning of the cell wall along with higher elasticity modulus and viscosity coefficient in space relative to ground controls [29]. Shagimardanova and colleagues analyzed the effects of microgravity on the transcriptome of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants growing in the Lada root module onboard the ISS [30]. They observed substantial transcriptomic differences between spaceflight and ground-control seedlings, including genes preferentially associated with stress response, pathogenesis, and antioxidant pathways [30]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) germinated and grown in a Science in Microgravity Box (SIMBOX) biological incubator on board the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft displayed dramatically altered photosynthesis characteristics with decreased photosystem 1 (PS1) efficiency relative to ground controls. This phenotype was associated with decreased abundance of proteins associated with the PS1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH), and cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) complexes. Hence, spaceflight may lead to declines in PSI activity in rice, either as a direct consequence of microgravity, or caused by side effects of spaceflight associated with inefficient airflow, high CO2 and ethylene levels, radiation, and/or other experimental parameters [31]. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment named APEX-06 (Advanced Plant Experiment-06) aimed at investigating the effect of spaceflight on the growth, morphology, and transcriptome profiles of Brachypodium distachyon, a genetic model for monocots closely related to cereal crops such as oat, wheat, barley, and rice [32]. We show that Brachypodium seedlings grown on the surface of foam substrates within modified Magenta-Box containers display accession-specific alterations in seedling organ growth onboard the ISS relative to ground controls. Surprisingly, exposure of Brachypodium to spaceflight conditions also triggered increased root-hair growth under our cultivation conditions, a phenotype that correlated with altered expression of key genes associated with ROS signaling and root-hair growth in one of the tested accessions. We also report dramatic differences in organ-specific transcriptomic responses to the spaceflight environment between Brachypodium accessions and discuss these observations within the context of monocot plant adaptation to spaceflight. Because a 1× g centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber utilized in these experiments, the growth and transcriptomic responses to spaceflight observed in this project may be the consequence of exposure to microgravity, radiation, or other spaceflight-associated parameters such as inefficient airflow and gas exchange, high ethylene levels, and/or other parameters.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. A Novel APEX Growth Unit Allows Transportation of Pre-Planted Dry Brachypodium distachyon Seeds to ISS and Subsequent Activation of Germination Experiments aimed at investigating the effects of microgravity environments on plant growth, development, and gene expression relative to ground controls should be conducted such that germination and growth occur under microgravity for the treated plants, avoiding any post-germination exposure to the 1-g conditions of Earth and/or hypergravity and vibration conditions typically experienced during takeoff and flight back to Earth. When using the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, seeds can be planted in agar-based media on the ground, then treated with far-red light followed by darkness to prevent germination during spaceflight [33]. Unfortunately, this far-red light pretreatment is not sufficient to block the germination of imbibed Brachypodium distachyon seeds before launch [34]. Therefore, we designed a novel foam-based growth system named the APEX Growth Unit, which can be planted with quiescent dry Brachypodium seeds on Earth, then transported to the ISS where the experiment can be activated by injecting growth medium into the foam. The APEX Growth Unit is made of a Magenta jar that contains a central Oasis Horticube foam whose general properties are described in the following link: https://oasisgrowersolutions.com/collections/horticubes%C2%AE (accessed on 6 February 2023) (Figure 1A) The foam block is wrapped with medical gauze and Nitex Mesch (Figure 1B) [35,36], and it is attached to an injection showerhead (Figure 1C). Surface-sterilized dry seeds are inserted in the foam before take-off, and germination is triggered by injection of sterile growth medium through the injection showerhead into the foam upon arrival on ISS. Plants growing on the surface of this foam block are contained within the Magenta jar, which maintains sterile conditions throughout the experiment. Several layers of medical gauze surrounding the nutrient-filled foam block assure better foam-to-root nutrient distribution during plant growth. Furthermore, a layer of Nitex mesh prevents roots from penetrating the foam block, assuring visibility of the root system throughout the experiment and facilitating root harvesting at the end of the growth period. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The APEX Growth Unit hardware. (A) The central Oasis Hortcube foam block (LC2, Oasis Grower Solutions) is used as a seed support during takeoff as well as following germination. It also serves as a nutrient reservoir during seedling growth. (B) The fully assembled APEX Growth Unit contains a foam block wrapped with a layer of medical gauze, allowing a more homogenous distribution of growth medium at the surface of the block where germinating seedlings are located. An outer layer of Nitex mesh prevents the roots of germinating seedlings from penetrating into the foam block, thereby hindering observation of their growth. (C) A growth-medium injection showerhead carries a central stick that serves as a support for a foam cube within the Magenta box. The injection showerhead is accessible for nutrient injection into the foam block through a port that crosses the Magenta box wall at its bottom. Black lines refer to 1 cm.To elucidate the effect of microgravity on Brachypodium seedling growth and expression profile, we grew three Brachypodium distachyon accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) under both microgravity and ground-control conditions. For each accession, four biological repeats per condition were carried out, each including one APEX Growth Unit (described in Section 2) planted with 28 seeds on the four surfaces of the foam block. A first group of 12 APEX Growth Units was flown to ISS, where astronaut Scott Tingle initiated the experiment by injecting nutrient medium into the foam of each unit and positioning the units into an onboard VEGGIE growth chamber following the blueprint shown in Supplemental Figure S1. This arrangement was designed to minimize differential exposure between accessions to the light gradients existing between the center and corners of the VEGGIE growth unit. After the first day of exposure to red light to synchronize germination, seedlings were grown under red, blue, and green light for a total period of 5 days. At the end of the growth period, seedlings were photographed, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater for subsequent RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis. A ground control was also carried out at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) with a two-day delay. This ground control mimicked the light, temperature, and CO2 conditions of the ISS experiment as well as the positions of the samples in VEGGIE. At the end of the growth period, ground control samples were photographed, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater following similar protocols as on ISS.2.2. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Seeds of three Brachypodium distachyon accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) were obtained from Drs. Daniel Wood and Richard Amasino (University of Wisconsin–Madison). They were germinated and grown in soil (Berger Soil, BM2: Perlite: Vermiculite = 2:1:1) side-by-side in the same growth chamber exposed to a constant temperature of 22 °C, 65% relative humidity, 20 h day/4 h night cycles and 100–120 µmol/m2/s cool-white fluorescent light during the days. The plants were fertilized every other week with Blossom Booster Fertilizer (10-30-20). They were allowed to self-fertilize and generate seeds under these conditions. After harvesting, seeds were allowed to rest at room temperature for a minimum of three weeks to lift dormancy. At the time of the experiment, seeds were dehusked, surface-sterilized with five successive 1-min washes with 95% (w/v) ethanol, and then air-dried in a sterile hood for at least 20 min. Then, 24 seeds per APEX Growth Unit were inserted into the foam (6 per side), oriented with the embryo directed outward on the surface. Each accession was represented by a total of four APEX Growth Units (total of 96 seeds per accession). The seeded APEX Growth Units were packed in Cold Bags [37] held at 4 °C and transferred to the Dragon capsule on SpaceX-14 where they were stored for 3 days before launch.2.3. ISS Experiment SpaceX-14 launched on 2 April 2018, and docked with the ISS ~2 days later. Twelve APEX Growth Units (4 per accession) were unpacked by astronaut Scott Tingle on 12 April 2018, and the experiment was activated by injection of 90 mL half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS: Sigma M5624 and MES: M2933) liquid medium into each APEX Growth Unit through the injection port (Figure 1). The APEX Growth Units were then integrated into the onboard VEGGIE (Vegetable Production System) growth unit fitted with Magenta-box holders following the pattern illustrated in Supplemental Figure S1 [38]. The red-LED lights were switched on to promote synchronized germination (low setting). After 24 h, the green and blue LED lights were also switched on (low setting) and the seedlings were allowed to grow for a period of 4 days under continuous light (blue, green, and red LEDs at an intensity of approximately 40–55 µmol/m2/s). HOBO environmental sensors/data loggers were placed into VEGGIE near the APEX Growth Units to capture the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) during the entire growth period. At the end of this growth period, seedlings were photographed with a Nikon D5 camera and then harvested into Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) preloaded with RNAlater (one KFT per APEX Growth Unit). Tissue fixation was initiated by forcing RNAlater from the storage chamber of the KFTs into the fixation chamber containing harvested plant tissue. Fixation proceeded at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The tubes were then stored in the Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer on the ISS (MELFI) for 20 days before being loaded onto the Dragon capsule and returned to Earth on 5 May 2018. The fixed samples were de-integrated from the KFTs and transferred into 50 mL Falcon Tubes at KSC, then delivered frozen at −80 °C to the Principal Investigator’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for molecular analysis.2.4. Ground Control A duplicated set of APEX Growth Units planted with seeds from the same three accessions was generated and used for a ground control experiment that was carried out in a VEGGIE growth chamber within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES was programmed to simulate the environmental conditions recorded by the HOBO sensors in the VEGGIE unit of the ISS, with a 2-day delay. The four APEX Growth Units associated with each of the three accessions were positioned within VEGGIE along a pattern that was identical to the one used in the ISS experiment (Supplemental Figure S1). The experimental protocol for this ground control experiment was identical to the one followed on the ISS. At the end of the growth period, the seedlings were also photographed with a Nikon D4s camera, then harvested in KFTs and fixed in RNAlater as described for the ISS experiment. After 1-day fixation at room temperature, the samples were transferred to a −80 °C freezer, then sent to the Principle Investigator’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under dry ice for subsequent RNA extraction and expression analysis.2.5. RNA Extraction and RNAseq Analysis Frozen fixed seedlings were thawed, then dissected to separate shoots and roots. Total RNA was extracted from the root or shoot tissues using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus extraction kits (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). DNAse-I treatment was performed in column using RNase-Free DNase-I Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA quality was monitored using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Eukaryotic total RNA NanoChip technologies (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Approximately 1 µg total RNA from each sample was used to generate cDNA libraries with rRNA reduction using TruSeq Stranded Total RNAlibrary Prep Plant Kits (lllumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Biotech Center DNA Sequencing Facility using NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were multiplexed with a target of ~60 million reads per sample for Bd21. For the other two accessions, Bd21-3 and Gaz8, RNA sequencing was performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (https://genelab.nasa.gov (accessed on 6 February 2023)) on a Illumina NovaSeq6000. Paired-end sequencing (2 × 100 bp) reactions were performed with ~120 million reads per sample. The corresponding sequencing fastq files have been uploaded into the GeneLab Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-375 (accessed on 6 February 2023); OSD-375; GLDS-375).2.6. RNA Sequence Mapping and Transcriptional Profiling The Tuxedo pipeline was used to map RNAseq sequence reads to the Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 reference genome version 3.0 (Phytozome) [39]. Briefly, the paired-end 150-bp (Bd21) or 100-bp (Bd21-3 and Gaz8) sequence reads were joined after filtering out low-quality bases with Phred scores below 30. TopHat2 was then used to map the splice junctions between exons after aligning the reads to the Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 reference genome version 3.0 (Phytozome) using Bowtie2 as alignment engine; 2-bp mismatches were allowed in this step. The percentages of sequence reads aligned to the reference genome for each sample are summarized in Supplemental Table S1. The overall read mapping rate averaged 75% to 80%, except for one of the Gaz8 root samples in the ground control (B3 position), which displayed a mapping rate of 41.7%. Considering the lower mapping rate for this sample, we excluded it, along with the matched B3 Gaz8 flight sample, from subsequent analyses. HTseq was used to calculate the number of reads assigned to each annotated transcript. The DEseq [40] and EdgeR [41] R-based packages were used to normalize the data and evaluate differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control samples. Four biological replicates per accession were used to identify differentially expressed genes. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using either the Benjamin–Hochberg method (for DEseq) or the q-values set to false discovery rates (FDR) of 0.05 (for EdgeR). Thresholds for significant differences were set at p(q) < 0.05.2.7. Bioinformatic Analysis, Annotation, and GO Enrichment of Differentially Expressed Genes Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated using the information available in Phytozome for Brachypodium distachyon accession Bd21 (Brachypodium distachyon Bd21 database, version 3.1; https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Bdistachyon_v3_1 (accessed on 6 February 2023)) [42]. Gene ontology enrichment analysis used the agriGO platform (http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). Singular enrichment analysis (SEA) was chosen for all enrichment analyses. Gene identification numbers (Bradi) associated with each annotated gene in Phytozome were directly used as input for all three accessions. For reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated DEGs, assignment to defined ROS-wheel categories was performed as defined in [43], using Arabidopsis orthologs to the Brachypodium DEGs as input. Predicted Arabidopsis orthologs to Brachypodium DEGs were obtained using Phytozome database (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Bdistachyon_v3_1 (accessed on 6 February 2023)). The threshold for significant enrichment was set at FDR = 0.05 [44,45]. For protein–protein interaction analysis, the STRING platform was used (https://string-db.org/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)) to identify potentially interacting DEG partners. GO enrichment and KEGG predictions were obtained directly from the STRING output [46]. For cis-acting element identification, we obtained the genomic sequence of the DEG’s transcribed region along with 5 kb of upstream and downstream sequences and used it as input data in the PLACE database to identify possible conserved cis-acting elements in proximity of each DEG (https://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE (accessed on 6 February 2023)) [47]. For transcription factor prediction and transcriptional regulation network analysis, Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot down-regulated DEGs belonging to the Photosynthesis GO group (GO:0015979) were identified and their Arabidopsis orthologs characterized. PlantRegMap (http://plantregmap.gao-lab.org/index.php (accessed on 6 February 2023)) was then used to search for possible transcription factors (TFs) regulating these DEGs [48]. This list of candidate TFs was compared to the full list of DEGs, allowing the identification of TFs that are differentially expressed in microgravity conditions relative to ground controls. These lists allowed us to reconstruct possible regulatory networks, which were manually drawn using Adobe Illustrator.2.8. Morphology Measurement High-resolution seedling photographs (with scale) were taken on the ISS and in ground control experiments at the end of the growth period before tissue harvesting and fixation. Shoot and root lengths were measured separately using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). All germinated seedlings were measured for each accession (n > 68). For root-hair length, the resolution of the photographs was not sufficient to allow determination of hair sizes along each photographed root. Therefore, root-hair length was quantified on only a portion of the seedlings analyzed. For each image, all roots that did not overlap with other roots and whose root hairs were clearly defined and measurable were used. Root-hair length was measured in a region of the root located approximately 3 cm above the root tip, within the mature zone, where the root hairs have reached full-length (n > 10 roots for each accession and growth condition). Student’s t-test with 2-tailed distributions and equal variances was used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences (p < 0.05), using Microsoft Excel.2.9. qRT-PCR Analysis 1 μg total mRNA per sample was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the qScript cDNA SuperMix and following a protocol recommended by the supplier (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA, USA). Then, 250 ng RNA-equivalent cDNA was used to perform RT-qPCR per reaction. The RT-qPCR reactions (250 ng cDNA, 0.2 μM primers, and 1× Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix; MidSci, St. Louis, MO, USA) were run on a LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Gene expression was calculated using the delta-Ct approach, and the data were standardized to the UBC18 (Bradi4g00660) reference gene [49]. All flight expression levels were standardized to ground control levels. Student’s t-test with 2-tailed distributions and equal variances was used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences between samples (p < 0.05), using Microsoft Excel (version 2009).3. Results 3.1. Microgravity Affects Seedling Growth in an Accession-Specific Manner In a first attempt to evaluate the effect of the microgravity environment of ISS on Brachypodium seedlings, we investigated the direction of root and shoot growth after five days of cultivation on ISS and a ground control at KSC, and quantified shoot and root growth from pictures taken at the end of the growth period under both conditions. Seedlings grown under microgravity showed more variation in shoot and root growth direction than those grown on the ground (Figure 2A), as expected considering the absence of gravi-response under microgravity. However, seedling organs were not randomly oriented. Shoots generally grew toward the light canopy whereas roots tended to grow away from it (Figure 2A). These directional growth trends may be partly due to the original orientation of the seeds embedded into the foam. However, phototropism may also offer directional guidance under microgravity. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Brachypodium distachyon seedlings display accession-specific morphological alterations in the microgravity environment of ISS relative to ground controls. Accessions include Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8. (A) Representative 5-day-old Brachypodium seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions grown on the ISS (upper panel) and on Earth (lower) panel). Biometric analysis of (B) root length and (C) shoot length of 5-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings from the Bd21 (n > 69), Bd21-3 (n > 68), and Gaz8 (n > 68) accessions. (D) Close-up view of representative roots of 5-day-old Gaz8 seedlings, showing differences in root-hair lengths between microgravity-exposed (left) and ground-control (right) seedlings. Representative root-hair length measurement is marked in the red line. (E) Quantitative measurement of root hair sizes between microgravity-grown and ground-control 5-day-old seedlings from the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions. Based on the resolution of the images, each root was measured once in the root mature zone from the root hair tip to the approximate root epidermal layer (n > 10). In B, C, and E, t-tests were used to determine the significance (* p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; n > 10).Morphologically, microgravity-exposed seedling roots were 16% to 18% shorter than ground controls for all three accessions tested at the end of the growth period (Figure 2B). For shoots, we only saw a 20% reduction of growth under microgravity for Bd21, whereas Bd21-3 and Gaz8 shoots grew similarly under both conditions (Figure 2C). In addition to observing differences in root and shoot growth under microgravity relative to ground controls, we also noticed a clear root-hair phenotype associated with growth under microgravity conditions. Indeed, the roots of microgravity-grown Brachypodium seedlings of all accessions were hairier than those grown on earth, at least for areas of the roots in direct contact with the feeding-block surface (Figure 2D). Unfortunately, we could not determine if this hairy-root phenotype was associated with increased root-hair density under microgravity. However, representative images from seedlings of all accessions tested were of sufficient resolution to allow the measurement of root-hair sizes. In all cases, root hairs were significantly longer on microgravity-exposed seedlings than ground controls (Figure 2D,E). Overall, these results suggest the existence of genetic variation between Brachypodium accessions for seedling growth responses to microgravity.3.2. Microgravity-Exposed Seedling Roots and Shoots Display Distinct Transcriptomic Profiles Compared to Ground Controls To evaluate the impact of spaceflight on gene expression, we compared the transcriptome profiles between microgravity conditions (ISS) and ground controls for dissected Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 Brachypodium distachyon seedling roots and shoots using the DEseq and EdgeR statistical packages. Candidate genes identified by both packages as displaying significant differences in expression between microgravity and ground control conditions are discussed below. The three Brachypodium accessions tested in APEX-06 showed distinguishable expression responses to the microgravity environment of ISS. A total of 1027 and 325 genes were found to be differentially expressed (DEGs) between microgravity-exposed and ground-control conditions in shoots and roots, respectively, for Bd21, which is the accession traditionally used as a reference in Brachypodium genome sequencing projects (Figure 3A,B; Supplemental Table S2). Bd21-3, on the other hand, displayed fewer DEGs under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, including 345 DEGs in shoots and 224 in roots (Supplemental Table S3). For Gaz8, 4186 and 475 genes were differentially expressed in shoots and roots (Supplemental Table S4), respectively (Figure 3A,B). This implies that different Brachypodium accessions may have distinct abilities to adapt to the microgravity environment of ISS based on the dramatic differences in expression responses to microgravity they displayed in this experiment. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcriptome analysis of Brachypodium seedlings grown under the microgravity environment of ISS and ground control. (A,B) Venn diagram summarizing the numbers of genes showing differential expression in roots (A) and shoots (B) between microgravity conditions and ground control for the three Brachypodium accessions analyzed here (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8). Genes showing statistically significant differences between these two conditions using two statistical packages (DESeq and EdgeR) are reported here. (C) Numbers of genes showing significant increases (red upward arrows), decreases (green downward arrows), or no change (horizontal black bar) in expression between microgravity and ground-control conditions in shoots and roots of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions.Within each accession, very few DEGs were found to overlap between shoots and roots. In fact, a vast majority of DEGs were differentially expressed in only shoots or roots (Figure 3C). This observation held true for all accessions tested in this study. When comparing accessions, only 46 and four DEGs were found to be shared by all three accessions in shoots and roots, respectively. We define these genes as common DEGs (Supplemental Table S5). The common DEGs share several interesting features. First, most of these common DEGs display expression changes in the same direction (up or down) under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in all three accessions (with only one exception in the shoot samples). This observation may suggest that the common DEGs represent a significant component of plant responses to the microgravity conditions on ISS. Second, we performed a GO enrichment analysis of these common DEGs, using their Arabidopsis orthologues as queries. While the list of common root DEGs was too small to warrant such an analysis, we noticed an enrichment of the list of down-regulated common shoot DEGs for genes associated with the Photosynthesis (GO:0015979; FDR = 8.6 × 10−9), Photosynthesis/Light Reaction (GO:0019684; FDR = 7.4 × 10−7), and Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy (GO:0006091; FDR = 6.3 × 10−5) GO groups. All these GO groups belong to the Photosynthesis-Related hierarchy (Supplemental Table S5). This observation is consistent with previous studies in Arabidopsis [50] and rice [31], and also with our observation discussed in the following section that photosynthesis-related Gene Ontologies (GOs) are enriched in the general lists of down-regulated shoot DEGs in all three accessions (Supplemental Figure S4). Third, several common DEGs found in our list encode cell-wall-related proteins, including two up-regulated wall-associated kinases (WAKs) in shoots and one up-regulated laccase and one down-regulated peroxidase in roots (Supplemental Table S5). This is also consistent with previous studies in rice or Arabidopsis, indicating differential expression of genes associated with cell wall composition and/or extensibility under microgravity conditions [22,51,52,53].3.3. GO Enrichment Analysis Suggests That Brachypodium Roots and Shoots Deploy Distinct Biological Strategies to Cope with the Microgravity Environment on ISS To understand the biological processes that may be affected by the microgravity environment, we analyzed our list of DEGs for possible GO enrichments. First, we split the DEG list into four categories for each accession based on their up- or down-regulation in root and shoot tissues, respectively. Figure 4 shows the list of GO groups over-represented in Bd21. Among all four categories, DEGs are enriched for genes associated with the Oxidation-Reduction Process (GO: 0055114) (Figure 4). However, the DEGs belonging to this GO group were distinct between shoot and root tissues (Supplemental Table S6). In the root down-regulated category, most DEGs belong to the peroxidase and cytochrome P450 super families. On the other end, only a few peroxidases were identified in the shoot down-regulated category. Instead, this category contained more photosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, seven peroxidase genes were observed in shoot up-regulated DEGs (Supplemental Table S6), indicating opposite peroxidase expression trends between root and shoot tissues under the microgravity environment for Bd21. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs from 5-day-old Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21 accession exposed to microgravity conditions of ISS relative to ground-control conditions. All DEGs from Bd21 are split into four categories based on tissue (root/shoot) and expression regulation under microgravity relative to ground control (up/down): (A) root down-regulated DEGs, (B) root up-regulated DEGs, (C) shoot down-regulated DEGs, and (D) shoot up-regulated DEGs. Enrichment significance is represented by both FDR numbers and color shading, with darker red representing smaller FDR values. Blue bars represent expected values (total number of genes representing the GO group divided by the total number of genes in the genome), whereas yellow bars represent observed ratios (number of DEGs belonging to the GO group divided by the total number of DEGs). The GO groups are arranged along a hierarchical tree of biological processes. The original information was generated by using the agriGO website (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/ (accessed on 6 February 2023)). The singular enrichment analysis (SEA) method was used to calculate significance. * refers to the GO groups that belong to two or more different hierarchies and are repeated in the table to better represent the hierarchies.Next, we expanded our GO enrichment analysis to DEGs identified in all three accessions analyzed in this project. Interestingly, the Oxidation-Reduction process (GO: 0055114) was found to be the only GO group enriched in all four categories of DEGs for all three accessions, reemphasizing the importance of the Oxidation-Reduction process in Brachypodium seedling responses to the microgravity environment on ISS (Supplemental Figures S2–S5). Previous studies have shown that transcriptomic responses to a variety of redox homeostasis perturbation experiments in Arabidopsis cluster into eight main groups (the “ROS wheel”), each showing similar patterns of expression changes in response to distinct classes of perturbations [43]. Because our study revealed that the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group is significantly enriched in the Brachypodium shoot and root transcriptomic responses to the microgravity environment on ISS, we compared our list of DEGs from Bd21 to the clusters identified in the ROS wheel. To do this, we used “best-hit annotation” (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html (accessed on 6 February 2023)) to identify Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs. From the 325 Bd21 root DEGs identified in our study, 296 have Arabidopsis orthologs, including 259 with unique orthologs. Further, 883 of the 1027 shoot DEGs were also found to have Arabidopsis orthologs, including 797 with unique orthologs (Supplemental Table S7 and S8). The lists of Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs were then compared to the lists of core genes associated with each cluster within the ROS wheel (Figure 5, Supplemental Table S9). Of the core genes identified in cluster I of the ROS wheel, 55% were orthologous to Bd21 shoot DEGs in our experiment. This result suggests that Brachypodium Bd21 shoots display expression responses to the microgravity environment on ISS that are similar to those displayed by Arabidopsis plants exposed to redox perturbations associated with defects in the GUN retrograde signaling pathway [54]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis orthologs to Brachypodium root and shoot DEGs with ROS-signaling annotation preferentially associate with specific transcriptional response clusters from the ROS wheel (Willems et al. (2016)). Clusters I-VIII refer to the categories of ROS-related experiments used to establish clusters of transcriptional responses in the ROS wheel meta-analysis. Bars represent the total number of genes present in each cluster. The proportions of genes present in a specific cluster that are also orthologous to specific microgravity-related Brachypodium DEGs (from this study) are represented in yellow.We performed a similar analysis in the Bd21-3 and Gaz8 accessions (Figure 5; Supplemental Table S9). Arabidopsis orthologs to Bd21-3 shoot DEGs associated with ROS signaling clustered preferentially with group-3 of the ROS wheel, representing early responses to high-light conditions, although this association did not reach statistical significance (chi-squared test; p = 0.54). For Gaz8, Arabidopsis orthologs to shoot DEGs preferentially clustered with both groups 1 and 3 of the ROS wheel (Figure 5; chi-squared test; p = 9.79 × 10−11). Together, these puzzling results suggest the existence of accession-specific responses to oxidative stress under microgravity conditions possibly triggered by differential organ sensitivities to distinct microgravity environment-related stimuli. Our results also suggest that Brachypodium seedlings grown under microgravity condition may use the retrograde signaling pathway to modulate their responses to the microgravity-related stressors and acclimate accordingly.3.4. Brachypodium Genes Associated with Photosynthesis Are Down-Regulated under Microgravity Conditions on ISS As mentioned in the previous sections, the oxidation-reduction process is important for Brachypodium seedlings growing under microgravity condition. When we compared the ROS wheel with our DEG lists, cluster I from the ROS wheel was significantly enriched within the Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot DEGs (Figure 5). Cluster I is enriched with photosynthesis-related genes [43]. Therefore, these results match our observation that Bd21 and Gaz8 shoot down-regulated DEGs are enriched with photosynthesis-related GO groups (GO.: 0015979, GO: 0019684, GO:0006091) (Supplemental Figure S4). This observation is also consistent with previous reports from Arabidopsis [50,55] and rice [31]. To understand the possible regulatory pathways leading to the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related Brachypodium genes under microgravity conditions, we sought transcription factors whose annotations predict a contribution to expression regulation of the photosynthesis-related DEGs in Bd21. Unfortunately, analyses using the Brachypodium and rice transcription-factor databases (http://plantregmap.gao-lab.org/index.php (accessed on 6 February 2023)) were not sufficiently robust to identify significant DEG expression regulators. Therefore, we used the Arabidopsis orthologs to our DEGs to search for possible regulatory networks. In the Arabidopsis genome, a total of 252 genes are annotated as associated with the photosynthesis GO group (GO:0015979). Among them, 99 were orthologous to genes within our DEG list. We used these 99 DEG orthologs as input to retrieve 29 candidate transcription factors that are predicted to regulate these DEGs in Arabidopsis. Brachypodium orthologs to these candidate regulatory transcription factor genes were then identified and compared to our list of DEGs in the Bd21 accession (Supplemental Table S10). This analysis allowed us to build the predicted regulatory networks connecting transcription factor genes associated with photosynthesis-related Bd21-DEG orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 6). Several short linear pathways were identified amongst the dow-regulated DEG orthologs (Figure 6A). On the other end, a more complex, branched regulatory network could be built connecting numerous up-regulated DEG orthologs (Figure 6B). Within this up-regulated network, one pathway has been more thoroughly investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, involving the PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR1 (PIF1, also named PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3-LIKE5; PIL5; At2g20180/Bradi5g21950) (Supplemental Figure S6, surrounded by an orange line). This transcription factor preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB) to modulate light effects in plants. Interestingly, the Phytochrome A (PHYA; Bradi1g10520) was also up-regulated in response to the microgravity environment in Brachypodium Bd21 shoots (Supplemental Table S2). Furthermore, up-regulation of PIF1 was previously reported to inhibit photomorphogenesis-related processes in several plant species, including chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in Arabidopsis [56,57,58,59]. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Arabidopsis transcriptional regulation networks involving transcription factors predicted to regulate DEG orthologs associated with the Photosynthesis GO group in Bd21. Orthologs to down-regulated (A) and up-regulated (B) transcription factors are shown in this figure. Nodes refer to the transcription factors and arrows indicate the direction of transcription regulation. Green represents down-regulation under microgravity whereas pink refers to up-regulation. Genes that are also orthologous to Gaz8 DEGs are surrounded by a blue circle with the same expression pattern. A regulatory pathway involving the PIF1 gene is surrounded by a yellow outline. See Supplemental Figure S6 for a more detailed description of the PIF1 regulatory network including target genes orthologous to Brachypodium DEGs.To evaluate a possible effect of microgravity-induced activation of expression of the Brachypodium PIF1-ortholog on the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and processes in Bd21 shoots, we compared our list of Arabidopsis orthologs to the Bd21 shoot DEGs with a list of PIF1/4/5- (PIF-trio) and PIF3-regulated genes in Arabidopsis (obtained from Supplemental Tables S9 and S10 of Zhang et al., 2013 [60]). Supplemental Table S11 shows a total of 88 Brachypodium shoot DEGs (64 down-regulated and 24 up-regulated DEGs) whose Arabidopsis orthologs are either AtPIF1/4/5 (PIFtrio)- and/or AtPIF3-regulated genes, with similar patterns (directions) of expression changes. This list of putative PIF-regulated genes is strongly enriched for photosynthesis-related GO groups (GO: 0015979, GO:0006091, and GO:0009765…etc.), as expected (p ≤ 7.6 × 10−29). To confirm the differential expression of these potential Brachypodium PIF-target genes under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, we used a RT-qPCR approach to quantify the expression of both PHYA (Bradi1g10520) and PIF1 (Bradi5g21950) along with four randomly picked DEGs from the list of Brachypodium orthologs to Arabidopsis PIF-response genes (Bradi3g07190, Bradi4g30060, Bradi2g16290, and Bradi1g1213). Results shown in Supplemental Figure S7 demonstrate a significant up-regulation of both PHYA (Bradi1g10520; 5-fold) and PIF1 (Bradi5g21950; 7-fold) in Bd21 under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls. It also demonstrates a down-regulation of all four DEGs under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls, in agreement with our RNAseq results. Taken together, our results suggest that up-regulation of PHYA and PIF-gene expression under microgravity correlates with the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in Brachypodium Bd21 shoots. Considering that Brachypodium is only distantly related to Arabidopsis, it will be important to directly test this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of Bradi5g21950 activation on expression regulation and photosynthesis related processes in Brachypodium distachyon. While our hypothesis of a role for Bradi5g21950 (Brachypodium PIF1 ortholog) and Bradi1g10520 (PHYA) in mediating the effect of microgravity on photosynthesis-related processes in Bd21 seems reasonable, the situation for Gaz8 may be more complex. Indeed, in Gaz8, seedling exposure to the microgravity environment on ISS appeared to either not affect or down-regulate the expression of PHYA and PIF-related genes (Supplemental Table S4). Furthermore, an analysis of photosynthesis-related Gaz8 DEGs identified 102 transcription factor genes as differentially expressed in Gaz8 under microgravity conditions. Yet, only six of these photosynthesis-related Gaz8 transcription factor DEGs were similar to those discussed above for Bd21 (Figure 6, blue circles). We conclude that another, yet unknown, mechanism may be responsible for regulating expression of photosynthesis-related genes in Gaz8. Whether such an alternative regulatory mechanism may also function, at least partially, in the regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in Bd21 and/or Bd21-3, remains unknown.3.5. Genes Annotated as Potential Contributors to Transcriptional and Post-Translational Regulation Are Up-Regulated in Microgravity-Grown Bd21 and Gaz8 Shoots In addition to the GO groups associated with plant responses to oxidative stress or photosynthesis discussed in the previous section, we noticed that two main hierarchies of GO groups associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated (GO:0006355) and Protein Modification (GO:0036211) are enriched in the microgravity up-regulated shoot DEGs in both Bd21 and Gaz8 accessions (Supplemental Figures S5). The DEGs associated with these two GO groups are listed in Supplemental Tables S12 and S13. In Bd21, 23 DEGs are associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated (GO:0006355). Annotation of best-hit Arabidopsis and rice orthologs to these DEGs suggests that most of them encode transcription factors [42] (Supplemental Table S12). Four of them are predicted to encode ethylene response-element binding proteins or ERFs (Bradi2g27920, Bradi3g18070, Bradi3g38140, and Bradi2g22505), suggesting activation of the ethylene signaling pathway; another two of these transcription factors have been associated with ABA signaling (Bradi2g45000, and Bradi2g45567), potentially contributing to the plant space–stress mitigation. Within the DEGs associated with the Protein Modification GO group (GO:0036211), the Phytochrome A (Bradi1g10520) gene discussed in the previous section may be an important modulator of plant responses to the microgravity environment of ISS. Additionally, 26 out of 31 DEGs associated with this GO group encode kinases. Of them, 15 are annotated as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs), including one annotated as brassinosteroid-receptor kinase-like protein (BRL1) (Supplemental Table S13). It is worth noting that RLKs have been shown to contribute to plant responses to biotic and abiotic stressors as well as cell development [61,62,63]. Finally, this list of DEGs associated with GO:0036211 also includes several wall-associated protein kinase (WAKs) genes. Proteins belonging to this group straddle the plasma membrane, connecting the wall with the cytoplasm. Their extracellular domain has been shown to interact with both proteins and pectins in the cell wall whereas their cytoplasmic segment contains a kinase domain that transduces information derived from wall integrity, pathogen invasion, cell shape, deformation, and mechanostimulation, into cellular responses. Microgravity-induced expression of such wall associated protein kinase genes was also reported in Arabidopsis thaliana [64]. In Gaz8, 112 up-regulated shoot DEGs are associated with the Regulation of Transcription, DNA-Templated GO group (GO:0006355) and 147 are associated with the Protein Modification group (GO: 0036211) (Supplemental Tables S12 and S13). As in Bd21, multiple ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs) are present in this list of shoot up-regulated DEGs. A couple of auxin response factor genes are also present in this list, as are several WRKY genes not found in the list of differentially expressed DEGs in accession Bd21 (Supplemental Table S12). The list of Gaz8-up-regulated DEGs associated with Protein Modification (GO:0036211) includes a majority of genes annotated as kinases, including three that encode kinases associated with the brassinosteroid signaling pathway and several WAKs, as also observed in Bd21. Additionally, this list also includes a large group of genes that encode calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, which are not differentially expressed in Bd21. This is noteworthy because calcium and calmodulin have been suggested to play important roles in gravity signal transduction and mechanotransduction in Arabidopsis [65]. Finally, the list of up-regulated shoot DEGs associated with GO:0036211 also includes several genes that encode kinases associated with the mitogen-activated kinase cascades, which have been reported to contribute to multiple signaling pathways, including those responding to abiotic and biotic stressors as well as hormonal signaling and developmental regulation [66,67,68].3.6. Genes Associated with the “Translation” GO Group (GO:0006412) Are Down-Regulated in Gaz8 Shoots and Roots under the Microgravity Environment on ISS As discussed in the previous sections of this manuscript, the three accessions of Brachypodium distachyon we tested showed both common and accession-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity, with the latter group predominating. In Gaz8, we noticed a significant association of down-regulated shoot and root DEGs with GO groups related to translation (GO:0006412; Supplemental Table S14), which was not observed in either Bd21 or Bd21-3 accessions. A majority of these genes encode proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis. Previous studies in rice and Arabidopsis have suggested ribosome biogenesis as an index of cell growth and proliferation in cell cultures [69,70]. Whether this microgravity-associated decrease in expression of ribosome biogenesis-related genes can explain the short-root phenotype displayed by Gaz8 seedlings grown on ISS remains unknown. Unfortunately, our experimental set-up did not allow quantification of root tip cell size and numbers of meristematic cells in the root apical meristem.3.7. Root Hair Growth Is Enhanced under Microgravity Conditions As discussed in the first section of results, seedlings grown under microgravity environment carried longer root hairs compared to ground controls. In an attempt to better understand the molecular mechanisms that govern this phenotype, we investigated the possibility that some root DEGs might be candidate root-hair growth regulators. Unfortunately, there is no published root-hair specific transcription profile in Brachypodium. Therefore, we identified both Arabidopsis and rice orthologs to root microgravity-related DEGs and then verified if any of the orthologs to these root-specific DEGs are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis and/or rice root hairs [14,71,72]. Starting with rice, this analysis revealed the existence of 19 Bd21 DEGs whose rice orthologs are preferentially expressed in rice root hairs [72]. Unfortunately, only one of these candidate DEGs was up-regulated in Bd21 under microgravity (Bradi3g20045), the remaining 18 being down-regulated (Supplemental Table S15). We then investigated whether Arabidopsis orthologs to the Brachypodium root DEGs are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis root hairs using the microarray data set published in Lan et al., 2013 [71]. Eighteen of the Bd21 root DEGs identified in this study have Arabidopsis orthologs that are also differentially expressed in Arabidopsis root-hair cells with similar expression trends (Supplemental Table S16). Similar comparisons involving Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 accessions identified 11 and 138 DEGs, respectively, with Arabidopsis orthologs showing similar patterns of differential expression in root hair cells [71]. None of these root-hair associated DEGs were identified as differentially expressed in all three accessions. However, Brachypodium orthologs to the Arabidopsis PIN2 gene (At5g57090), which encodes an auxin efflux carrier family protein recently shown to play an important role in root-hair development [73,74,75], were shown to be down-regulated in Brachypodium in response to the microgravity environment (Bradi2g52640 for Bd21 and Bd21-3 and Bradi1g31530 for Gaz8; Supplemental Table S16). Unfortunately, there is to date no evidence that a knock-down mutation of PIN2 will cause a longer root-hair phenotype. Therefore, we currently have no clear molecular explanation for the long root-hair phenotype displayed by Brachypodium seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS. An opposite root-hair response to microgravity has been reported for Arabidopsis seedlings (shorter root hairs relative to ground controls) [14]. It should however be cautioned that root-hair growth and development are highly sensitive to a variety of environmental and hormonal constraints such as water, nutrients and oxygen availability, mechanical perturbations, pH and ROS status, exposure to ethylene, etc. [76,77,78]. Importantly, the hardware and experimental designs used in the Arabidopsis study discussed in reference [14] and our Brachypodium experiment differ significantly in several respects. For instance, our Brachypodium seedlings were grown in foam-based APEX Growth Units with constant light exposure, while Kwon et al. grew their Arabidopsis seedlings in agar-based media inside the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware under complete darkness. The differences in seedling growth conditions between these two experiments could explain, at least partly, the differences in root-hair responses to microgravity.4. Discussion In this paper, we describe the morphological and transcriptomic changes displayed by the seedlings of three Brachypodium distachyon accessions in response to the microgravity conditions of ISS relative to ground controls. Microgravity-exposed seedlings of all three accessions displayed shorter roots than ground controls, a phenotype that was previously reported for other plant species such as Cress [79], wheat [80], and Arabidopsis [16]. It is however important to note that a decrease in primary root length in response to microgravity is not a general plant response, as other reports have indicated increases in root length for microgravity-exposed seedlings in flax, rice, and soybean [29,81,82,83,84]. The reasons for such variations in root growth responses to microgravity are not known, although differences in genotypes and growth conditions may be responsible. Some of the gene-expression responses to the microgravity environments uncovered in this study may provide some clues, though. Indeed, genes annotated as regulating cell wall extensibility such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (Bradi1g27867) and expansins (Bradi1g74720, Bradi3g50740, Bradi3g50730, and Bradi3g27440), were down-regulated in Bd21 Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions (Supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, knockout mutations in Arabidopsis orthologs to these genes have been reported to restrict cell wall extensibility and limit cell expansion and root elongation [85,86]. Similarly, we observed a tendency for many ribosomal-related genes to decrease in expression in Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in Gaz8 accession (Supplemental Table S13). Previous studies using Arabidopsis cell cultures demonstrated a correlation between ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth, observing a depletion in both processes under both microgravity conditions or simulated microgravity [69,70]. Unfortunately, our experiments were not set up to allow observation of cell numbers in the root apical meristem, or cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the short-root phenotype displayed by Brachypodium seedlings exposed to microgravity derive from decreased cell proliferation in the root apical meristem or altered cell elongation in the elongation zone. Our transcriptomic analysis of Brachypodium responses to the microgravity environment on the ISS differentiated between shoot and root responses. This allowed us to demonstrate dramatic differences in expression responses between shoots and roots for all three Brachypodium accessions analyzed. In fact, only 3% of the DEGs identified in this study were similarly differentially expressed between root and shoot samples. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis of these DEGs uncovered distinct major GO groups as enriched in shoot and root DEGs, respectively. The few GO groups that were similarly over-represented between shoot and root DEGs included genes that showed opposite expression responses to the microgravity environment between organs, as nicely documented by the expression differences between shoots and roots for distinct subgroups of peroxidase genes belonging to the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group in Bd21 (Supplemental Figure S6). These results are compatible with those reported for Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings exposed to microgravity [6]. They suggest that the roots and shoots of young Brachypodium or Arabidopsis seedlings develop distinct response strategies to cope with the constraints dictated by exposure to the microgravity environment on ISS. Alternatively, it is also possible that the roots and shoots of young seedlings exposed to microgravity are subject to different environmental constraints imposed by their distinct functional contributions to plant development. Similar models can be proposed to explain the vastly distinct transcriptional responses to microgravity displayed by the three Brachypodium accessions analyzed in this study. These accessions evolved under distinct conditions in different ecosystems within the Mediterranean area [87]. The varying selective pressures they encountered during their evolutionary history led to distinct genotypes that likely favored their adaptation to their native environment. When transferred to a new environment such as the microgravity conditions on the ISS, plants belonging to distinct accessions are differentially equipped to respond to these new constraints, leading to diverging root and shoot expression profiles along with differential growth and/or morphological responses. Larger-scale investigations of root and shoot growth and expression responses to microgravity of multiple Brachypodium accessions using genome-wide association studies should, in the longer term, provide exciting new information on key loci contributing to this variation in morphological and molecular adaptive responses to microgravity. Plants have been identified as key components of bioregenerative life-support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. This is in large part due to their ability to photosynthesize, thereby recycling CO2 and wastewater to produce O2, carbohydrates, and other biological molecules necessary for plant growth and development. The resulting biomass will constitute a significant source of food, feed, and fiber for the crew. Our data indicate that many photosynthesis-related genes are down-regulated in Brachypodium seedling shoots under microgravity conditions. We showed that such transcriptional responses of photosynthesis-related genes to the microgravity environment of ISS may be associated with oxidative stress exposure leading to an activation of the GUS retrograde signaling pathway and/or activation of PIF gene expression. It is interesting to note that hypergravity exposure, which leads to a strengthening of the cell wall, has recently been associated with increased chloroplast size, photosynthesis, and plant growth in moss, possibly reflecting a source–sink link between photosynthesis and carbohydrate utilization in cell wall restructuring [88]. Furthermore, Arabidopsis PIF proteins have been shown to directly bind to the LAZY4 promoter, thereby activating its expression and modulating the gravitropic response [89]. Therefore, future work will focus on investigating possible mechanistic connections between gravity and microgravity exposure, retrograde signaling between plastids and nucleus, PIF-mediated signaling, photosynthesis, wall restructuring, and carbohydrate metabolism. In conclusion, our morphological and transcriptomic study of space-grown Brachypodium seedlings provides new insights into monocot plant responses to spaceflight. Because a 1× g centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber, the responses to spaceflight observed in this project cannot be unambiguously assigned to microgravity exposure. Indeed, some of these responses may also result from exposure to other spaceflight-associated parameters such as radiation, inefficient airflow, high ethylene levels, and/or other experimental parameters. Some of the responses to spaceflight displayed by Brachypodium distachyon seedlings are similar to those from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, including oxidative stress response, decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and wall restructuring. Those types of general responses also appear to be common between Brachypodium distachyon accessions. We also observed some transcriptional responses to microgravity conditions that are more specific to Brachypodium distachyon accessions, suggesting a specificity of response that may be expected from plant populations that have been subjected to distinct evolutionary constraints and are now subjected to a totally new environment (microgravity). Our studies focused on the early stages of seedling development, and it will be important to evaluate the contribution of the identified responses to spaceflight at later phases of plant development and reproduction. A careful evaluation of the contribution of each response, general or specific, to the microgravity environment and its significance for plant survival, growth, and productivity under microgravity should lead to the design of better cultivars and/or cultivation methodologies to produce crops with improved potential for use as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. Furthermore, the existence of distinct molecular responses to the microgravity environment between species, and between accessions within species, suggests the need to expand these types of studies directly to cultivated crop species of potential use during spaceflight.Acknowledgments The authors thank the flight support team and the project managers at Kennedy Space Center and the astronauts for all the help in making this project possible.

Keywords: Arabidopsis thaliana, RNAlater, scanning electron microscopy, SEM, spaceflight Experimental flexibility is a luxury often taken for granted in typical laboratory science. Adapting a protocol in response to unfolding information as the experiment proceeds is a key element in discovery and is standard practice. In spaceflight, this luxury is not as accessible; crew time is highly regulated, orbital resources are limited, and protocols are tightly controlled once in place. In addition, the up-mass available to each researcher is limited, which restricts the choices of experimental treatments and orbital fixation options. These constraints often translate into hard choices that limit the scientific return on investment, including sacrificing the number of replicates to enable additional treatment and fixation scenarios. As a consequence, options that allow maximization of the data obtained from a single sample are highly valued. Biological experiments are typically required to be segregated based on the analyses to be performed upon return from spaceflight. These segregated conditions are usually either molecular or morphological, due to the separate fixatives required for each application (e.g., Stutte et al., 2006). Investigations focused on transcriptome analyses, for instance, would not be likely to commit a portion of their limited up-mass on samples and associated fixation hardware for morphological applications, and would miss the opportunity to use both morphological and molecular perspectives. These limitations are keenly felt in scenarios where the transcriptome analyses reveal spaceflight-specific patterns of gene expression central to morphological patterns of cell growth and development. This scenario was encountered in a recent spaceflight experiment, in which telemetric imaging revealed interesting spaceflight-associated root morphologies (Paul et al., 2012). All material was fixed on orbit in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA) to facilitate transcriptome analyses on returned samples. Although it is possible to partition an experiment into molecular and morphological components, using samples that correspond directly to those used in molecular applications would be of extreme value. A single fixation protocol better enables the full use of replicates to support a robust power analysis; all plant material allowed by the up-mass constraints can be dedicated to a single application per orbital treatment. Additionally, the plant material apportioned for microscopy can be taken directly from the pool of material whose balance represents a molecular replicate; thus, any morphologic change seen in these plants would directly reflect the effects of the altered gene expressions from those same plants. Terrestrial field studies could also benefit from this single fixative approach for similar reasons. Despite its use as a molecular fixative, RNAlater is not commonly used as a morphologic fixative. RNAlater fixation produces unclear images with high background staining (Cadoret et al., 2013) and reduces immunofluorescent signals (Zaitoun et al., 2010; Paul and Ferl, 2011). This intracellular occlusion eliminates the possibility of clear subcellular localizations. However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a fresh-like state, which suggests that RNAlater may be acceptable for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases in the literature report the use of RNAlater in a morphological investigation. Behrendt et al. (2011) reported that coral covered in crustose coralline algae was fixed in RNAlater, postfixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and postfixed again in OsO4 prior to SEM investigations. Hofer et al. (2012) used SEM in their study on floral organs of Clermontia species using RNAlater as their main fixative with a hexamethyldisilazane drying step. In the current study, both of the above techniques resulted in significant tissue damage in Arabidopsis. An alternative to fixation in SEM sample preparation is freezing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior fixation, but instead preserves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging (Koroleva et al., 2010; Sarsby et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013). However, few laboratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study investigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard SEM, a “cryo-analog,” where tissue would first be returned to a fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS For process development, test samples of 9–12-d-old A. thaliana var. columbia (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource [TAIR], Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNAlater and fixed overnight at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNAlater-fixed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subsequent steps (Fig. 1A, B). Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like state (Fig. 1C, D) suitable for flash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immediately following the final wash into 5–10-mm lengths to fit on the SEM sample stage (“stub”). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Preliminary RNAlater-fixation investigations. (A, B) Arabidopsis root tip (A) and root tissue (B) were processed through an ethanol dehydration gradient. Tissues were then processed following the protocol in Appendix 1, starting at the critical-point-drying step. No desalination step occurred. 800×, scale bars = 37.5 μm.

Note fracturing in (F) due to planchette adhesion. 500×, scale bars = 60.0 μm.The first two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The first cryo-analog protocol was flash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Tissues were severely damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which resulted in vitrified ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the planchettes and break (Fig. 1E, F). The third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in minimal tissue damage. The risk of water–ice crystal formation and planchette adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10% and increasing at 10% intervals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1% tannic acid in methanol was used to enhance electron density (Mizuhira et al., 1972; Roholl et al., 1981). Arabidopsis tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN2-cooled liquid ethane, which vitrified any remaining water in each sample. These rapid hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than automated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN2-cooled individual cryovials, containing either 2% OsO4 in MeOH or 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was filled with LN2 to prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to increase the temperature to 10°C over the course of 4–10 d. Cryovial caps were left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10°C, cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets (SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120–200 μm pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4°C) methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Individual baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 2 mm2, as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying occurred via liquid CO2 critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Microsystems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol with CO2, followed by three 10-min infiltrations. One final exchange was performed and left overnight. Two additional 10-min infiltrations were performed, followed by CPD with controlled venting. Samples were in solution until the end of CPD. Dry samples in baskets were transferred to a desiccant-filled (Drierite; W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, Ohio, USA) sealable container until being mounted on stubs using carbon adhesive and returned to a stub rack within a different desiccant-filled sealable container. Mounted samples were sputter-coated for 90 s with a gold-palladium alloy (Desk V HP; Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, New Jersey, USA) and imaged on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Initial observations were focused on roots, resolution of cell files, and retention of root hairs throughout the processing of the tissue (Fig. 2). Later tests observed trichomes and more durable tissues, such as adaxial leaf surfaces and seed coats (Fig. 2A–C). The fresh-frozen tissues, used as protocol development control material, retained finer details, including closed stomata and normal trichome morphology (Fig. 2D, E). RNAlater-fixed test materials yielded similar images as the fresh-frozen plants, with minimal additional tissue damage (Fig. 2F–K). Fig. 2.

(K) RNAlater-fixed spaceflight root section (700×, scale bar = 42.9 μm).Spaceflight materials and the corresponding ground controls, both fixed in RNAlater, were processed using the protocol discussed above and detailed in Appendix 1. Tissues yielded images of acceptable quality, with minimal cell wrinkling and high retention of fine details (Fig. 2J, K). The focus of these samples was root structure, morphology, and root hair retention because of interesting molecular and genetic observations from a recent spaceflight experiment (Paul et al., 2012; Paul et al., unpublished). Cost of the developed protocol is minimal, while the accessibility is high. Assuming the microscopy core to be used has standard SEM capability, the additional cost of this protocol is merely the cost of consumables. These components are readily available and likely already obtained by the laboratory interested in using this protocol. Another advantage of this protocol is a near retention of tissue morphology at a fresh harvest state. Not only are finer elements of tissues retained (Fig. 2D–I), but other tissues, such as the adaxial leaf epidermis, seed coat, and floral stalk (Fig. 2A–C), produce results comparable to those processed through dedicated morphologic means (e.g., Bhargava et al., 2013). The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other standard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in Liu et al. (2008), Koizumi et al. (2010), Springer et al. (2010), and Yi et al. (2010). As a result of this protocol, samples fixed with RNAlater retained many fine features including root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells inflated and displaying fresh-frozen–like morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested during spaceflight or on the ground.CONCLUSIONS The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both spaceflight and ground-based experimental applications. Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNAlater and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic fixative (Fig. 2J, K). Field studies may also benefit from the use of this protocol. As in spaceflight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical fixative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the field may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNAlater by expanding the available techniques for study. Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in Koroleva et al., 2010; Sarsby et al., 2012; and Yu et al., 2013), though desalination of specimens prior to tissue processing would still be beneficial. A second option is a cryo-holder, seen in Tang et al. (2012), which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN2 vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; Marti et al., 1988; Hansma et al., 1989; Ushiki et al., 2012). Due to the high ionic content of RNAlater and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could generate comparable images without any tissue processing. This possibility was not tested due to lack of access to the necessary equipment. The protocol reported here will likely require optimization for each desired tissue to be tested. Arabidopsis is a very fragile tissue, with limited flat surfaces and small organ sizes. Other plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher technique, while more fragile tissues (i.e., floral tissues) may need a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to enhance tissue integrity include a postfixation step or reversing CPD and sputter-coating. A postfixation step (as seen in Behrendt et al., 2011), which would take place after the desalination, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog plunge, especially if fixatives for electron microscopy, such as Karnovsky’s or OsO4, are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD (as seen in Yi et al., 2010) may also improve the physical tissue integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a vacuum during the coating process may prove difficult. The use of this protocol provides more morphological opportunities for samples that would have previously been wasted due to improper fixation. It is designed to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices. Although this process needs to be adapted to each sample being studied, it enhances flexibility in experiments when the main objective is not imaging. Appendix 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Most multicellular organisms have specialized organs, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedicated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensing columella cells found in the plant root tip (Sato et al., 2015). However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cells and organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity (Paul et al., 2012). Yet the fundamental question of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remains unanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth and provide unique experimental information about gravity-sensing mechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceflight (Rea et al., 2016; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceflight advances fundamental knowledge about how cells recognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare for long-term space exploration. Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled organisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they are indeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by the spaceflight environment. In the microgravity of spaceflight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reflected in, differential gene expression when compared to living on the ground (Salmi and Roux, 2008; Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in microgravity (Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the response of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to spaceflight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation to spaceflight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plants deficient in a known gravity-sensing gene: Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1). Several reasons contributed to the selection of Arg1 for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence that Arg1 functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots (Sedbrook et al., 1998; Blancaflor, 2013). During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efflux carrier proteins—such as PIN2 and PIN3—to the basal side of the statocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap (Abas et al., 2006; Harrison and Masson, 2008b; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). Although this process has not been demonstrated in non-statocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Several additional characteristics made Arg1 a particularly interesting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells. Arg1 is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specific gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does not appear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typified by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism (Guan et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009; Morita and Nakamura, 2012). Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 is localized throughout the endosomal/secretory pathway, enabling it to interact with both vesicular trafficking and integral membrane proteins (Boonsirichai et al., 2003). ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009); thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conserved J domain at ARG1's N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signal transduction (Caplan et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1995), also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. The J-domain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperones by interacting with HSC70 (Young et al., 2003), and the ARG1/HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role in protein transfer (Jouhet and Gray, 2009; Su and Li, 2010). HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceflight in several plant systems (reviewed in Schüler et al., 2015), including undifferentiated cells (Paul et al., 2012; Zupanska et al., 2013), strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to a J domain, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton (Sedbrook et al., 1999; Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Harrison and Masson, 2008a). The cytoskeleton is central to many models of single-cell gravity sensing (Ingber, 1999; Vorselen et al., 2014), and actin has been specifically implicated in gravisensing (Kamada et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2015). Thus ARG1's extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undifferentiated cells. Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to comparable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceflight environment on these cells. The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight environment and, in particular, test the effect of removing Arg1, a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utilization of this mutant also revealed genes important to spaceflight adaptation that would not normally be recognized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceflight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the level that is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceflight in WT cells. However, if the expression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WT levels to enable spaceflight adaptation. Thus the altered expression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceflight adaptation. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1's role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specific, differentiated cells and organs for environmental sensing.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Concept of operations and comparison approach When a cell transitions from Earth to orbit, it responds and begins to adjust its metabolism to the stimuli offered by the new environment. In this experiment, the patterns of gene expression established after 10 days of growth in the BRIC hardware were used to illuminate the strategies undifferentiated cells used to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between cells grown in the two environments: spaceflight and the comparable ground controls. The genes identified in this “vertical” comparison reflected physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment within each genotype. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes. The genes identified in this “horizontal” genotype comparison showed the impact of removing ARG1 from metabolic processes in both the normal ground control environment as well as in the spaceflight environment. Comparing gene expression patterns revealed potential roles for ARG1 in both environments. An overview is shown in Fig. 1 and details of the approach provided below. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Graphical presentation of the two approaches used in the microarray data analysis. (A) ARG1 KO and WT mark the gene expression profiles for respective cell samples. Solid arrows represent the direction of comparison of the gene expression profiles. The red box and arrows indicate the first approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between cells grown in the two environments: spaceflight and the comparable ground controls. The green box and arrow indicate the first part of the second approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes on the ground. The blue box and arrow indicate the second part of the second approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes in spaceflight. (B) Microarray data comparison groups used to obtain the significantly differentially expressed genes between the samples.This first analytical approach involves the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of spaceflight-grown cells to the ground controls for each of the two cell lines, thereby characterizing the physiological adaptation of each genotype to spaceflight (red box in Fig. 1A and red arrows in 1B). Genes identified in WT cells contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to microgravity and spaceflight. If physiological adaptation to spaceflight depends entirely on functional Arg1, then the ARG1 KO cell line would be in severe decline, and the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles would reflect that stress. If ARG1 is not involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight, then the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles from ARG1 KO cells would be largely the same as WT. However if ARG1 functions simply as part of the pathways engaged by spaceflight, then the pattern of genes differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight will differ between WT and the knock-out cell line but retain some degree of overlap. The second analytical approach involves the comparison of gene expression profiles between WT and ARG1 KO cells both on the ground and during spaceflight (green and blue box of Fig. 1A and green and blue arrows of 1B). This approach reveals gene expression differences in the cells adapted to either environment with a disabled Arg1 gene. Since ARG1 has a role in typical cell maintenance, it was likely that the gene expression profiles of ARG1 KO cell culture would differ from WT in the ground environment, as a knock-out cell line would adapt its metabolism to compensate for the absence of the important gene. Since the gene expression patterns on the ground will likely affect the nature of adaptation to spaceflight, it is important to compare the gene expression profiles between the two genotypes of the ground controls (green box of Fig. 1A and green arrows of 1B). Finally, every individual gene engaged in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight experiment was examined in the ARG1 KO cells to determine whether the gene was similarly expressed or changed in the knock-out line. If a gene was changed in the same way in both genotypes, then we concluded it was Arg1 independent. However, if a gene was not engaged in the ARG1 KO cells, or was engaged in a different manner than in the WT cells, then the expression of that gene in the WT adaptation to spaceflight was determined to be dependent upon ARG1 function. 2.1.1. The CEL experiment of BRIC-17 The CEL experiment setup and organization was a modification of a previous Arabidopsis cell culture experiment in BRIC-16 (Paul et al., 2012). The CEL BRIC-17 experiment was launched on board the Dragon capsule of the SpaceX-2 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the ISS on 1 March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the BRIC hardware. The BRIC hardware remains stationary after it is de-stowed from the Dragon Capsule and deployed to the ISS. The BRIC hardware does not have a centrifuge component, nor is it compatible with the limited centrifuge facilities on the ISS, such as the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) centrifuge. Additional hardware details and BRIC illustrations can be found in Paul et al. (2012). The experiment made a direct comparison of spaceflight-grown cells to those grown as controls on the ground for the purpose of exploring the complete range of effects that spaceflight presents to plant cells, which includes but is not limited to the effects of microgravity. Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC-17 payload. Each chamber housed five PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60 mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were two plates with WT cells and three plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRIC containers on the ground in the International Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as ground controls. The ground controls were initiated with a 48 h delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed on the ISS with RNAlater™ (Ambion) on the 10th day on orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri plate. Twenty four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), where it resided until cold stowage transport back to Earth within the Dragon capsule. After returning to Earth, the samples were reclaimed at KSC and then transported to the University of Florida laboratories. As described below, the total RNA was extracted from spaceflight samples and corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays. Although the BRIC hardware has virtually no air circulation, no gas exchange, and no light, that hardware configuration is not substantially different from the normal growing conditions of the undifferentiated tissue culture cells, which are typically grown in sealed Petri plates in the dark (Johnson et al., 2015). 2.2. Tissue culture cell lines Arabidopsis callus cultures were established de novo from well-established plant lines available through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, www.arabidopsis.org) and are indicated below. Each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 × solution), 2,4-D (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were then transferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 × solution) and 2,4-D (0.5 mL/L) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lines each of Col-0 ecotype were the subject of this study: WT and arg1, the latter being a knock-out line generated from the ARG1 T-DNA insertion (SALK_024542C). The arg1 cell line is referred to as ARG1 KO throughout. The SALK line was obtained through TAIR. The SALK mutant line (arg1-3) is characterized by a T-DNA insertion at position 952 (in an intron). Although the mutated gene can produce a truncated transcript, it is not functional, and arg1-3 is considered a null allele (Gleeson et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013). 2.3. Preparation of BRIC-17 CEL cell culture plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were transferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, the material washed once with fresh liquid media, and then the sample was decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, USA) that contained 6.5 mL nutrient agar media [MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D MES buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)]. The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to ensure sterility of both the interior and exterior of the plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher), and then driven to KSC. The BRIC-17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time. 2.4. RNA extractions Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.5. Microarrays cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.). Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 μg/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45°C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceflight and ground control, five plates of WT and four plates of ARG1 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 2.5.1. Microarrays data analysis Affymetrix Expression Console Software (Version 1.3) was used to generate .CEL files for each RNA hybridization. All analysis was performed in R 3.0.0 and Bioconductor version 2.12 (R Development Core Team, 2012). Background adjustment, summarization, and quantile normalization were performed using Limma package (Smyth, 2004). Normalization was made using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 normalization algorithm (Hubbell et al., 2002). Data quality was assessed using the arrayQualityMetrics package and various QC charts (Density & Intensity plot, NUSE, RLE, and RNA Degradation Plot). Probes that had absent signals in all samples were removed. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from spaceflight samples was compared to the probe-set signal value of ground control samples to give gene expression ratios. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Limma package with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed with stringent criteria at p value <0.01, abs Fold Change >2 (−1 < FC log2 > +1; labeled as log2 Fold Change) unless stated otherwise. The microarray data are publicly available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the  () data repository under accession number GSE81442.2.5.2. Comparison groups The groups outlined in the concept of operations and comparisons were established and abbreviated with combination of two capital letters and a short version of the cell line name in superscript (Fig. 1B). Letters are as follows: G for ground control, F for spaceflight; superscripts are Wt for WT cells, Arg for ARG1 KO cells. 2.6. Functional gene categorization, Gene Ontology annotations Gene function was annotated by associations of controlled vocabularies or keywords to data objects (Gene Ontology, GO). Multiple GO toolkits of this controlled vocabulary system were used to collect annotations of gene function. Various lists of gene names were created, and enrichment GO terms were searched after statistical tests from precalculated backgrounds. All three aspects of gene products (molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location) described by GO-controlled vocabularies were considered. A significance level of 0.05 and five genes as minimum number of mapping entries were implemented for the analysis parameters in the following tools. AgriGO: An integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community AgriGO was used (Du et al., 2010). AgriGO query criteria were as follows: Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Arabidopsis gene model (TAIR9) precomputed background, Fisher was selected as a statistical test method of choice with NOT-adjust multi-test adjustment method, Significance level was set at 0.01 or 0.05, Minimum number of mapping of entries was set at five, Plant GO slim was selected from other GO types. The Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value (FDR) was calculated manually using R function on the significant GO terms. For Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE), selected species was Arabidopsis thaliana, NOT-adjust was selected for multitest adjustment method, significance level was set at 0.05, Minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 10, and Plant GO slim was selected from other GO types. AmiGO: If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II: ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabidopsis was also used (Obayashi et al., 2009). Making gene function table function was implemented to retrieve organized information on gene function (based on TAIR annotation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProfiler: A web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists was used. Arabidopsis thaliana was a selected organism with most of the default options except the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR significance threshold was selected (Reimand et al., 2007). 2.7. Real quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR The total RNA (850 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One-tenth of total cDNA was used as a template for a single RT-qPCR run. RT-qPCR was carried out using TaqMan™ technology on the ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) reagent was used for the duplex RT-qPCR reaction with 6FAM and VIC-dye labeled, TAMRA-quenched probes. In all reactions the Ubq11 (At4g05050) served as an internal control. Each duplex PCR mixture contained 900 nM target gene-specific forward and reverse primers each, 150 nM Ubq11 forward and reverse primers each, 250 nM 6FAM labeled target gene-specific probe, and 250 nM VIC-labeled Ubq11 probe. Primers and probes were designed with Primer Express software and supplied by Applied Biosystems.

Real quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was performed as reported previously. Briefly, the thermal cycling program consisted of 20 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C, and 30 s at 59°C. Reactions were quantified by threshold cycle, Ct. Primers and probe sets were first subjected to validation experiments to test the efficiency of the target and reference amplifications. The Ct values for respective number of biological replicas of each experimental group (treated, control) were analyzed using 7500 Software v2.0.5 along with Microsoft Excel and the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method. The ΔCt was calculated as the difference between the threshold cycle value of a target gene and that of Ubq11 (endogenous control) in the same sample, while ΔΔCt was calculated as the difference between the ΔCt value of a treated sample and that of the control (calibrator). The fold difference of the target gene expression in treated samples relative to control samples (calibrator) was calculated as 2^(–ΔΔCt) and then log2-transformed.",

First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments: spaceflight cells and comparable ground controls, which reflected the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two genotypes: WT and ARG1 KO cells, which provide a comparison of cell responses in spaceflight and on the ground. Figure 1A and 1B illustrates the matrix that was used to compare the two genotypes and two environmental conditions of this experiment: Ground Control WT (GWt), Ground Control ARG1 KO (GArg), Spaceflight WT (FWt), and Spaceflight ARG1 KO (FArg). The specifics of each comparison follow. 3.1. The Arg1 expression across samples The Arg1 transcript level in the ARG1 KO cells is substantially lower (6.4-fold) than in WT cells; however, this difference did not register as statistically significant. The average raw transcript of the Arg1 gene in the four biological replicates of the WT ground control cells is 307, whereas the average raw Arg1 transcript in the three biological replicas of the ARG1 KO ground control cells is 48. The value from the ARG1 KO cells was derived from three replicate values that were sufficiently dissimilar (80, 11, 53) as to be scored as not statistically valid. There was virtually no difference in Arg1 transcript levels between the ground and the spaceflight samples in either WT cells or ARG1 KO cells. The average raw transcript level of Arg1 in the four biological replicas of the WT spaceflight cells was 313 compared to that expression in WT cells on the ground, 307 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Data are available at http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/ast.2016.1538). The average raw Arg1 gene expression in the three biological replicas of the ARG1 KO spaceflight cells was 25 compared to 48 in ARG1 KO cells on the ground. Although Arg1 transcription itself does not appear to be influenced by the spaceflight environment, the impact of removing a functional Arg1 gene has a dramatic effect on the expression patterns of many other genes (see following sections). 3.2. Differentially expressed genes in all four comparison groups 3.2.1. Alterations in the expression of 78 genes characterize the physiological adaptation of WT cells to spaceflight—FWt : GWt The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment were identified for WT cells by comparing the gene expression profiles in WT spaceflight cells (FWt) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the FWt : GWt group comparison (Fig. 1B). In that comparison 78 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell treatments at p value <0.01 and log2 Fold Change >1; 46 genes were upregulated, and 32 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S1 Gene list 78). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab The number of the significantly differentially expressed genes identified in all comparison groups. The color code corresponds to the color of arrows in Fig.1: red represents the significantly differentially expressed genes of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, green represents significantly differentially expressed genes of the ground transcriptome, and blue represents significantly differentially expressed genes of the spaceflight transcriptome.The functional annotation of the genes of the FWt : GWt group comparison indicated that genes of the endomembrane system, Golgi apparatus, and plant-type cell wall were highly represented in the WT adaptation to spaceflight. For instance, genes localized to Golgi apparatus were all upregulated in the WT spaceflight cells compared to the ground counterparts (e.g., At3g18260 Reticulon family protein; At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2 protein disulfide isomerase-like 1-2 localized to the endomembrane system; At4g07960 CSLC12 cellulose-synthase-like C12 and At2g03760 ST1 sulphotransferase 12; Table 1 GO 78; Table S1 Gene list 78). The defense response group was also highly represented among the Biological Process ontology (gProfiler, TAIR, AgriGO), with pathogen/cell wall–associated genes At3g43250, At2g44490 (PEN2), and At2g03760 (ST1) being upregulated.

Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.2.2. Cells lacking functional Arg1 changed the expression of 130 genes to adapt to spaceflight, and those genes were fundamentally different than those of WT cells—FArg : GArg The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment were identified for ARG1 KO cells by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells (FArg) to ARG1 KO ground control cells (GArg) in the FArg : GArg group comparison of (Fig. 1B). There were 130 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at p value <0.01 and log2 Fold Change >1; 68 genes were upregulated, and 62 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S2 Gene list 130). The functional annotation of the genes of the FArg : GArg group comparison indicated that physiological adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells relied on metabolic processes distinct from those used in WT cells. Genes of the cell periphery from the GO Cellular Components category, response to hormone and response to lipid, and xyloglucan metabolic process of the GO Biological Processes, and transporter activity from the GO Molecular Function categories, were highly represented among the genes ARG1 KO cells differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight. For example, three genes of the cell wall–related xyloglucan metabolic processes (At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1; At4g03210 XTH9 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 9 and At2g06850 XTH4 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 4) were substantially downregulated in spaceflight ARG1 KO cells (Table S2 Gene list 130; Table 2 GO 130), whereas cell wall–associated genes were upregulated in WT cells. Genes encoding cellular transporters were generally upregulated in ARG KO as compared to their ground counterparts' cells; examples include At1g80510 Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein, At2g38330 MATE efflux family protein, At2g36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, At1g63440 HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5, At3g14770 SWEET2 Nodulin MtN3 family protein, At3g05030 NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, and At1g72700, a E1-E2 type ATPase family.

The genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptomes between ARG1 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO ground cells (GArg) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the GArg : GWt group comparison of Fig. 1B. The 90 genes were differentially expressed due to the Arg1 mutation on the ground with approximately as many genes upregulated (39) as downregulated (51) (Fig. 2; Table S3 Gene list 90). Many genes with adjusted expression to the Arg1 mutation on the ground classified as plasma membrane, membrane, and cell periphery Cellular Component ontology (gProfiler). For instance, genes At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein localized to the membrane and participating in the defense response and At4g40070 RING/U-box superfamily protein localized to the extracellular region were upregulated. On the other hand, genes At4g30660 Low temperature and salt responsive, At2g36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, At3g26830 PAD3 PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 had substantially diminished expression level in ARG1 KO cells on the ground than WT cells (Table 3 GO 90; Table S3 Gene list 90). The heterocycle metabolic process and organelle organization were among the Biological Process ontology terms represented by genes affected by Arg1 mutation on the ground. For instance, genes At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER, chromosome maintenance genes At4g02060 PRL Minichromosome maintenance (MCM2/3/5) family protein, and At5g48600 SMC3 structural maintenance of chromosome 3 had diminished expression on the ground in ARG1 KO cells relative to WT cells.

Comparison of the gene expression profiles between ARG1 KO and WT genotypes during spaceflight shows unique genotype-specific expression patterns—FArg : FWt The genes differentially expressed between ARG1 KO cells and WT cells in the spaceflight environment were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells (FArg) to WT spaceflight cells (FWt) in the FArg : FWt group comparison (Fig. 1B). There were 107 genes significantly differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cell samples in spaceflight (Fig. 2). Nearly half the genes were upregulated in ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight and half downregulated as compared to WT cells in spaceflight (Table S4 Gene list 107). Many genes differentially expressed between the WT and ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight were classified in GO Biological Processes ontology (gProfiler, AgriGO) as transport and establishment of localization, developmental, and xyloglucan metabolic processes (Table 4 GO 107; Table S4 Gene list 107). Interestingly, the genes related to transport processes (At4g37640 ACA2 calcium ATPase 2, At2g01980 SOS1 sodium proton exchanger, At5g49500 SRP54 Signal recognition particle, At5g03280 PIR2 NRAMP metal ion transporter, At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex, At2g26900 BASS2 Sodium Bile acid symporter, and At1g22710 SUT1 sucrose-proton symporter 2) all showed much reduced expression in spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells as compared to WT cells. Similarly, all four genes associated with the xyloglucan metabolic process (At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1, At4g03210 XTH9 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 9, At1g11545 XTH8, and At2g06850 XTH4) were also significantly diminished in the spaceflight ARG1 KO cells compared to the spaceflight WT cells. Finally, 14 genes out of 15 representing the transporter activity term of the Molecular Function ontology were also under-expressed in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells as compared to WT spaceflight cells (Table S4 Gene list 107).

Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class. 3.3. Physiological adaptation to spaceflight of ARG1 KO cells is fundamentally different from WT cells—comparing FWt : GWt to FArg : GArg Most of the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells were fundamentally different than those engaged in WT cells. When the 130 genes differentially expressed in the FArg : GArg group comparison were compared to the 78 genes differentially expressed in the FWt : GWt group comparison, only three genes changed in the exact same way: At3g08590 putative 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, At3g30843 hypothetical protein, and At5g56270 transcription factor WRKY2 (Fig. 2, Table S1 Gene list 78 and Table S2 Gene list 130). These three genes, therefore, constitute the only genes of the WT response that are totally independent of ARG1 function. The remaining 127 genes of the ARG1 adaptation to the spaceflight environment constitute an adaptation unique to the ARG1 KO genotype. 3.4. The gene expression patterns on the ground play a fundamental role in the gene expression patterns of spaceflight—comparing GArg : GWt The information about the expression pattern of the 90 genes differentially expressed on the ground between the WT and ARG1 KO cells, GArg : GWt, was assessed in all other comparison groups: the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, FWt : GWt, the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, and between genotypes in spaceflight, FArg : FWt (Fig. 3).

Category I Corrected—25 genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome engaged in the ARG1 KO in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight to match the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category II Required—12 genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome at the level required for the spaceflight transcriptome, engaged in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells; these genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category III—53 genes showed significant differential expression in the ground transcriptome (GArg : GWt) alone. These genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt.The 25 genes of the 90 (GArg : GWt) showed significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, but no significant differential expression in WT cells, FWt : GWt (Fig. 3, Category I). Thus the ARG1 KO cells corrected the expression of those genes as they adapted to spaceflight, apparently to reestablish the WT level of expression that is needed in that environment. These genes included, for example, At1g32950 (Subtilase genes commonly associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism) and At2g36830 (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein) (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3).

Blank cells indicate that the gene was not significantly differentially expressed in a respective comparison group. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.The 12 genes out of 90 (GArg : GWt) showed significant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells (FWt : GWt) but no significant expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) (Fig. 3, Category II). This genotype-based change in the ARG1 KO ground control cells resulted in the expression levels of these genes on the ground matching the WT expression levels in spaceflight. There was a single gene (At2g40020, hypothetical histone-lysine N-methyltransferase protein) among these 12 with an unusual behavior, as it was also differentially expressed in spaceflight between the two genotypes. However all 12 genes were considered to be expressed in the ARG1 KO on the ground at the level required for the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight. These genes included genes associated with the extracellular region (e.g., At1g30600 Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 lipase; At1g13080 CYP71B2 cytochrome P450; At1g07380 ceramidase activity; At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism; Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). The 53 genes out of 90 (GArg : GWt) showed no differential expression in any other comparison group (Fig. 3, Category III). Thus, although the gene expression patterns between genotypes on the ground were different, both cell lines likely made only small adjustments to gene expression, which resulted in no change in expression levels when the two genotypes from spaceflight were compared. Some of these genes represented plasma membrane and membrane related processes: At4g11850 PLDGAMMA1 phospholipase D gamma, At2g02170 Remorin family protein, At5g52440 HCF106 Bacterial sec-independent translocation protein mttA/Hcf1061 importing protein into chloroplast thylakoid membrane, At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). With the exception of At2g40020, none of the 90 genes that were differentially expressed between genotypes on the ground (GArg : GWt) showed differential expression between genotypes in the spaceflight environment (FArg : FWt). 3.5. Corrected and compensated expression 3.5.1. Corrected expression: the patterns of the genes associated with spaceflight physiological adaptation affected by Arg1 mutation—comparing FArg : GArg, FWt : GWt, and FArg : FWt Information about the differential expression of the 130 genes differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). Each of the 130 genes was significantly differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg and could be also significantly differentially expressed in other comparison groups. There were three genes out of 130 (FArg : GArg) that showed significant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and no differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt; Fig. 4, Category I). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab (A) The heat map visualization of the 130 differentially expressed genes of the physiological adaptation in the ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg), as arranged into Categories I–IV by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FArg : GArg, FWt : GWt, GArg : GWt, FArg : FWt). Category I Independent—3 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells changed in the same way as in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category II Corrected—25 genes being part of the 102 pool of genes were differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells and were corrected during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells to achieve the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Corrected PATTERN 1 102 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category III Corrected—77 genes being part of the 102 pool of genes, corrected during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells to achieve the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome, the gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Corrected PATTERN 1 102 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category IV Compensated—25 genes being part of the 107 pool of genes (see Fig. 4B) that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment as they showed differential expression between ARG1 KO and WT cells in the spaceflight transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. (B) The heat map visualization of the 107 differentially expressed genes in the spaceflight transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells (FArg : FWt) as arranged into Categories I–III by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FArg : FWt, FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt). Category I Compensated—25 genes being part of the 107 pool of genes (see Fig. 4A) that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 2 25 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt. Category II Compensated—13 genes being part of the 82 genes in the 107 pool of genes that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 3 82 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt (except one gene). Category III Compensated—69 genes being part of the 82 genes in the 107 pool of genes that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 3 82 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt.There were 102 genes out of 130 (FArg : GArg) that showed no significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells, FWt : GWt group comparison and no differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt (Fig. 4, Category II). Thus, these 102 genes are potentially genes whose expression needs correction from the ground genotype of ARG1 KO so as to be returned to a necessary expression level for spaceflight adaptation. These 102 genes represented genes typically associated with the cell periphery, endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus, plastid and chloroplast of the Cellular Component as well as the single-organism localization and transport and signaling of the Biological Process ontology terms. Particularly genes of the transmembrane transport of various moieties were highly represented (e.g., AT1G80510 Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein, AT2G38330 MATE efflux family protein, AT2G36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, AT5G20280 SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F, AT3G05030 NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, and AT1G71050 HIPP20 Heavy metal transport/detoxification superfamily protein) (Table 6 GO Fig. 4A; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). Genes associated with cell signaling were also found among these 102 genes (AT1G03060 SPI Beige/BEACH domain; WD domain, G-beta repeat protein, AT2G43010 SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, AT3G20410 CPK9 calmodulin-domain protein kinase 9, AT3G16570 RALF23 rapid alkalinization factor 23).

Compensated genes that showed differential expression in the spaceflight transcriptome, regardless of differential expression in the spaceflight adaptation of ARG1 KO cells. Blank cells indicate that the gene was not significantly differentially expressed in a respective comparison group. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.5.2. Compensated adaptation, revealing adaptive strategies to spaceflight—comparing FArg : FWt, FWt : GWt, and FArg : GArg The information about the differential expression of the 107 genes differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg (Fig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). Each of the 107 genes was significantly differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt and could be also significantly differentially expressed in other comparison group, but this was not a required feature of the categorical response. There were 25 genes of 107 (FArg : FWt) that showed significant differential expression in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg group comparison (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B Category I). There were 82 genes of 107 (FArg : FWt) that showed no significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg (Fig. 4B Category II and III). Some of these 82 genes were associated with components of the extracellular region, cell wall, external encapsulating structure, cell periphery, plasma membrane, endomembrane system, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus of the Cellular Compartment ontology terms (gProfiler). Also, cellular aromatic compound metabolic process, localization, and transmembrane transport were represented among the Biological Process ontology terms. Two genes represented the cellular aromatic compound metabolic process (At4g37650 SHR GRAS family transcription factor and At3g20540 PolIB polymerase gamma 1). Genes involved in sugar transport (e.g., At1g77210 STP14 sugar transporter 14 and At2g43240 Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) and genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport (e.g., At5g56230 PRA1.G2 prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 and At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex small-chain family protein) were representative of other transport processes (Table 7 GO Fig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). With the exception of At2g40020 mentioned above, none of the 107 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt showed significant differential expression in the ground genotype comparison group GArg : GWt (Fig. 4B).3.5.3. The Arg1-dependent genes in the WT adaptive strategy—comparing FWt : GWt and FArg : GArg The 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells established the base of genes needed to adapt to spaceflight. Each gene of 78 FWt : GWt was categorized into Arg1-independent, Arg1-dependent, or partially Arg1-dependent. A gene was considered Arg1 independent if it showed the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells; thus the same change in gene expression was observed in FWt : GWt and FArg : GArg (Fig. 5A). The expression of such a gene was adapted to the spaceflight environment in the same fashion regardless of the Arg1 mutation. There were three genes where Arg1 seemed to have no role in the physiological adaptation (Fig. 5A Category I; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). FIG. 5. Open in a new tab (A) The effects of the Arg1 mutation on the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The heat map visualization of the 78 differentially expressed genes in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight (FWt : GWt), as arranged into Categories I–IV by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt, FArg : FWt). Independent Group, Category I—3 genes showed same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells and showed no differential expression in either transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Dependent Group, Category II—12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT but were voided during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment when Arg1 was mutated. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. Dependent Group, Category III—12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells and differential expression in the ground transcriptome between ARG1 KO and WT, matching the WT spaceflight expression level. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Partially Dependent Group, Category IV—51 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells alone. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. (B) The distribution of the genes across dependence groups with relaxed p value requirements. Heat map visualization of the 78 genes differentially expressed in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight (FWt : GWt) across all group comparisons (FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt, and FArg : FWt) with increasingly relaxed p value stringency criteria clustered by the dependence pattern. The Category I, II, III, and IV of the respective dependence groups are same as defined in Fig. 5A. Dependent Group, Category V—genes were differentially expressed one way in the WT spaceflight-to-ground transcriptomes and the other way in the ARG1 KO spaceflight-to-ground transcriptomes, and were also opposite in patterns between WT and ARG1 KO within environments. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. The column in gray font corresponds to Fig. 5A and the gene distribution at the p value <0.01. The columns in black font summarize the gene number distributions showed on the heat maps. Abbreviations: ND = not detected; .02, .03, .04, .05 = stringency criteria of the p value <0.02, <0.03, <0.04, or <0.05, respectively.A gene was considered Arg1 dependent if it did not show the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, as it did in WT cells FWt : GWt (Fig. 5A). There were 24 genes exhibiting the Arg1 dependence (Fig. 5A Categories II, III, Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). These 24 Arg1-dependent genes could be divided into two categories based on the source of the Arg1 dependency: Category II or III of Fig. 5A. Category II genes of Fig. 5A were not differentially expressed in either the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) or ground genotype comparison (GArg : GWt), but showed differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison (FArg : FWt). Thus, the absence of a functional Arg1 gene had the impact of rendering the adaptive-to-spaceflight genes unresponsive (Fig. 5A, Category II). The majority of those genes were associated with the endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus or the intracellular membrane-bounded organelle and cell periphery and plasma membrane GO terms of the Cellular Component ontology (e.g., At3g49780, PSK4 phytosulfokine 4 precursor and At2g43240, Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). Category III genes of Fig. 5A were not differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg), were differentially expressed in ground genotype comparison (GArg: GWt), but showed no differential expression in spaceflight genotype comparison (FArg : FWt). These genes were already altered on the ground in ARG1 KO cells to match the spaceflight expression levels in WT (Fig. 5A, Category III). There were 12 genes showing such an expression pattern, some of which were associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism (e.g., At1g30600, Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 alpha/beta-Hydrolases superfamily protein and At2g44490, PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). Table 8. GO Dependence Fig. 5A Open in a new tab The significant GO terms assigned to the genes in Arg1-Independent, Arg1-Dependent, and Arg1-Partially Dependent categories based on gProfiler and AgriGO functional annotation. Red cells indicate gene overexpression, green cells indicate gene downregulation, and gray cells indicate no significant differential expression. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.There were 51 differentially expressed genes in FWt : GWt that were not significantly differentially expressed in any other comparison group (Fig. 5A, Category IV). These genes were considered Arg1 Partially Dependent as there was not enough statistical support to assign them to either the independent or dependent group. These 51 genes were primarily associated with the GO Biological Process of response to stimulus, with few related to the response to light (e.g., At3g08570 Phototropic-responsive NPH3 family protein, At5g63600 FLS5 flavonol synthase 5, At1g76570 Chlorophyll A-B binding family protein or to high light stimulus At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). The distribution of 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells (FWt : GWt) among the Independent, Dependent, and Partially Dependent was established with increasingly relaxed p value stringency criteria from p value <0.01 through p value <0.05 without changing the stringency of the Fold Change criteria (−1< FC log2 >+1) (Fig. 5B). The number of Independent genes increased from three through five up to six genes. The Dependent genes not only increased in total numbers, but a new group of Dependent genes emerged. The three to four genes showed the new expression pattern such that they were coordinately differentially expressed in WT spaceflight adaptation (FWt : GWt) and in the ground genotype comparison between WT and ARG1 KO cells (GArg : GWt) yet the opposite in the ARG1 KO spaceflight adaptation (FArg : GArg) and in the spaceflight genotype comparison between the WT and ARG1 KO cells (FArg : FWt) (Fig. 5B Category V). The biggest depletion of gene total number was in the Partially Dependent gene pool, from 51 genes at the p value <0.01, through 43, 37, 35, and 31 at the p value <0.05 (Fig. 5B Category IV). 3.6. The microarray data validation To validate the correctness of the significance criteria applied in the microarray data analysis, the RT-qPCR was performed. For objectiveness, the target genes were selected from among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the WT spaceflight cells of the BRIC-16 experiment (Paul et al., 2012). The RT-qPCR results aligned with those of the microarray (Supplementary Fig. S2). Only one gene, the Agp12, showed significant under-expression in the spaceflight ARG1 KO cells relative to their ground control counterparts as identified in the microarray data analysis and as measured by the RT-qPCR method. The Agp12 gene target in all other comparison groups as well as the remaining targets across all comparison groups showed no differential expression levels as measured by the means of microarrays or RT-qPCR. The significance stringency criteria applied throughout the microarray analysis seemingly prevent the false-positive or false-negative inclusion.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion The gene Arg1 was found to have a dramatic influence on the gene expression profiles that define physiological adaptation of cell cultures to spaceflight. Like WT cells, the ARG1 KO cells thrived in the spaceflight environment, suggesting that the presence of ARG1 is not absolutely required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. However, the ARG1 has an essential role in defining the WT adaptation to spaceflight. ARG1 KO cells adapted to spaceflight by expressing different genes, providing unique insight into the alternative pathways for physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight. 4.1. WT adaptation to spaceflight is highly dependent upon Arg1 There were 78 genes differentially expressed in WT when comparing spaceflight to ground control. Those 78 genes comprise the obvious primary set of genes involved in spaceflight physiological adaptation of WT cells. Only three of these 78 genes were similarly changed in ARG1 KO cells, suggesting that only these three were completely independent of Arg1 (See Independent group below and in Fig. 2, Fig. 4A Category I, Fig. 5A Category I). The remaining 75 genes are most likely reliant on Arg1 function. Twenty-four of these genes are definitively dependent upon Arg1 at the highest levels of analytical stringency (Categories II, III of Fig. 5A). The remaining 51 genes are likely to be dependent upon Arg1 but do not reach p value of <0.01 (Category IV of Fig. 5A); however, reducing the required p value level brings more genes from the Partially Dependent group into the clearly Dependent group (Fig. 5B). This result strongly suggests that Arg1 has a prominent role in generating a large part of what would be considered the proper spaceflight gene expression profile for spaceflight adaptation in WT cells. 4.2 Without functional Arg1, cells engage a unique gene expression strategy that further illuminates required elements of the WT spaceflight adaptation ARG1 KO cells engaged vastly different genes to adapt to spaceflight than did WT cells, suggesting that not only is Arg1 function required for much of the WT adaptation to spaceflight, but also that cells without Arg1 can compensate for the lack of Arg1 by changing the expression of a different set of genes. This suggests that the genotype, and likely then physiological state, of the cell line on the ground profoundly affects the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression profiles seen in the ground genotype comparisons suggested that WT and ARG1 KO cells have different gene expression requirements for the maintenance of a healthy physiology in a normal terrestrial environment. The basis for engaging very different genes in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO can be explained along two lines of reasoning. First, some genes involved in WT adaptation to spaceflight were already changed to a spaceflight-adapted level in ARG1 KO on the ground and were therefore not needed to be differentially expressed as the ARG1 KO adapted to spaceflight (Fig. 3 Category II, 12 genes). These genes are Required in that they must be maintained at the WT spaceflight level in order for these cells to adapt to spaceflight. Second, some of the genes that showed differential expression on the ground between the ARG1 KO and WT cells were Corrected to match WT expression levels during the ARG1 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight (Fig. 3 Category I, 25 genes; the same 25 genes found in Fig. 4A Category II). These genes define a new part of the overall landscape of genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight: those which are needed to be at a certain level of expression in spaceflight, but if that level is already present in ground transcriptome, it is not necessary to alter expression patterns to achieve the spaceflight transcriptome. However, if their expression on the ground is altered due to confounding factors, such as a mutant background or physiological stress, then expression levels would need to be corrected for spaceflight transcriptome, thereby revealing essential genes that would otherwise be missed. An additional set of Corrected genes are those that are differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO. The 77 genes from Category III (Fig. 4A) comprise such a group. As with the Category II genes in Fig. 4A, these genes were corrected to WT spaceflight levels during the ARG1 KO adaptation to spaceflight. Taken together, these 77 genes plus the aforementioned 25 reveal 102 genes that comprise a previously unappreciated part of the spaceflight adaptation process. Some of the genes that showed differential expression in ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight adaptation were also differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cells in spaceflight. These 25 genes apparently Compensated for the absence of a functional Arg1 both on the ground and during spaceflight (25 labeled with an asterisk, Fig. 4A, Category IV). These genes would not be a part of the typical WT spaceflight response but are necessary in the ARG1 KO to adapt to spaceflight. 4.3. The landscape of genes required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight The landscape of the genetic requirements for spaceflight adaptation is much more complex than is revealed by the genes that are changed in expression in WT cells adapted to spaceflight. The complexity of the physiological adaptive processes related to genotype is represented in the Venn diagram of Fig. 6. In the WT response 78 genes are changed in expression, leading to the conclusion that these are the genes necessary for adaptation. ARG1 KO data suggest that this is an overly simple view of the adaptation requirements of WT cells. ARG1-mutant cells show that many genes whose expression is altered on the ground by that genotype must be corrected to WT levels to adapt to spaceflight. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab The gene landscape for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. At least 180 genes are Important for spaceflight adaptation. These genes were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptomes between WT and ARG1 KO. Seventy-eight genes in WT and 130 in ARG1 KO were differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, thus also between spaceflight and ground. Three of these genes were coordinately expressed in both genotypes; thus they were independent of Arg1 function. Of the 78 genes of the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, 51 were at least partially dependent, and 24 were dependent on Arg1. There were 102 genes whose expression needed to be corrected to WT spaceflight adaptation levels in the ARG1 KO cells. There were 107 genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptomes between ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight and WT cells in spaceflight; 25 of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells and were part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight ARG1 KO cells alone (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B, Category I indicated with *), 82 of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells but were not a part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight.These observations suggest that adaptation of a cell line to spaceflight is highly dependent on its physiological state, which is in turn guided by its genotype. The two cell lines in this study arrived at a different gene expression profile on orbit and changed expression of a different set of genes to get to that profile. Therefore, it is likely that there is no single gene expression profile that defines the spaceflight-adapted state for Arabidopsis cells. Rather each cell type and genotype will have a largely unique-appearing change in gene expression profiles in adapting to spaceflight. 4.4. Biological implications of the gene expression profiles The agriGO PAGE tool (http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/) was used to evaluate specifically enriched biological processes in each of the comparison sets (Fig. 7). In addition, the potential roles of individual genes comprising the differential expression groups of the landscape described above (Independent, Dependent, Required, Corrected, Compensated; Fig. 6) were examined in more detail. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab Functional category comparisons among the differentially regulated genes in the four transcriptome comparisons using Parametric Analysis of Gene Expression. Yellow-to-red and cyan-to-blue color scale in CM (color mode) indicate whether the representation of the genes encompassed in that term is up- or downregulated as a group. The Gene Groups comprising each analysis are provided in the first column. No (number) represents the number of genes included in each GO term. Ont refers to the Ontology group represented (P = biological process, F = molecular function, C = cellular component). The CM comparison categories are as follows: 1 is FWt : GWt, 2 is FArg : GArg, 3 is GArg : GWt, and 4 is FArg : FWt, and the numerical values supporting the color rendering are provided to the right of the CM columns. The blank rows represent the null results obtained from individual analyses of the two components of the Gene Group “78 + 102 = 180 Important to WT spaceflight adaptation” (78: Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent) and (102: Corrected). Individual comparisons did not display a coordinated pattern of expression according to ontological categories.The PAGE analysis revealed that although individual genes may differ in each expression set, those genes are largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting different paths can be taken to arrive at the same destination. For instance, processing all 180 Important (Fig. 6) genes in PAGE indicated some variety in the biological processes engaged in each spaceflight-to-ground, and genotype-to-genotype, comparison. If the gene sets comprising the subcategories on Important genes are processed (Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent, and Corrected; Fig. 6), there were no significant differences in the general biological processes used by the two genotypes to physiologically adapt to spaceflight (middle panels Fig. 7). In other words, depending on the initial resources available in a cell's metabolic “tool box,” slightly different routes of approach appear to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. A closer look at the genomic strategies used by WT and ARG1 KO cells to navigate diverse routes to a common goal revealed genes essential to spaceflight adaptation, including genes that would be masked if we were to have simply essayed WT response strategies alone. Although there was not always a common functionally binding them together, in many cases, genes comprising each category defined above were often aligned in strategic roles. 4.4.1. Independent genes The genes of this small category are tied together by potential roles in the detection and maintenance of cell polarity. The most highly induced of the Independent genes is a WRKY2 (At5g56270) transcription factor known to play a major role in the establishment of cell polarity by regulating apical/basal cell fate by activating WOX8 (Jeong et al., 2016). Cell polarity is also tied to auxin transport (Gao et al., 2008), and if the p value is relaxed to a value <0.05 (see Fig. 5B), two of the three additional genes that become included are associated with auxin/brassinosteroid signaling pathways: At1g78860, a curculin-like family protein, and At4g22500, an auxin-induced gene of unknown function (GEO GDS744) (Huang et al., 2013). Curculin-like genes have also been implicated in the regulatory network that establishes the adaxial/abaxial surfaces in Arabidopsis (Reinhart et al., 2013), which also connects to the regulatory pathways that guide polarity in plant cells.4.4.2. Dependent genes There were 75 genes that were at least somewhat dependent on a functional Arg1, many of which were transcription factors associated with the regulation of hormone signaling and cell proliferation. The two most highly induced genes were transcription factors bZIP16 and APD1. Factor bZIP16 primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes responsive to light, gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) (Hsieh et al., 2012), while RING-finger protein APD1 (ABERRANT POLLEN DEVELOPMENT1) is associated with pollen development and with signaling in the 9-Lipoxygenase pathway central to root development and pathogen defense (Qin et al., 2014; Walper et al., 2016). This latter role could connect it to another highly induced gene in this category: PSK4, which encodes a precursor to Phytosulfokine 4, one of a family of cell wall receptors that function in cell proliferation, expansion, and wound repair (Tameshige et al., 2015). Interestingly, PSK4 has been shown to promote callus growth in root explants and, further, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by subtilase SBT1, a gene which is also induced in spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (Chevalier et al., 2005). The gene SRF5 appears to be a member of the STRUBBELIG family of transmembrane receptor-like kinases that contribute to the regulation of cell morphogenesis and proliferation (Chevalier et al., 2005).4.4.3. Required genes Among the Dependent genes there were also 12 genes differentially expressed between WT and ARG1 KO cells on the ground, which were further subcategorized as Required (Fig. 5A Category III); many of the Required genes were associated with pathogen response. Among the highly induced were an uncharacterized lipase that has been associated with auxin signaling and pathogen response, a cytochrome450 (CYP71B2) that has shown downregulation in response to pathogens, and PEN2, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that is essential for defense against powdery mildew in barley (Schenk et al., 2003; Cabrera et al., 2014). Likewise with the three upregulated genes encoding proteases—one encoding a Subtilase family protein that has a role in processing a cell wall pectin methylesterase, another was a member of the cystatin/monellin superfamily of proteases, a group which plays a role in pathogen resistance, and finally a ubiquitin-like protease (Senechal et al., 2014; van Wyk et al., 2014). A gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism (neutral/alkaline non-lysosomal ceramidase) was also upregulated. Sphingolipids are a class of lipid signaling molecules that play a role in the apoptotic processes associated with plant pathogen defense, which also ties this Required gene to defense-related metabolism (Berkey et al., 2012). There was one downregulated gene in this group of genes: an uncharacterized Zinc knuckle (CCHC-type) family protein (At2g12880). A survey of GEO profiles reveals that At2g12880 is highly overexpressed in Arabidopsis mutants of subunit 4 (CSN4) of the COP9 signalosome responsible for the regulation of auxin response (Huang et al., 2013). The abundance of pathogen response and cell wall–related genes in this category suggests that Arg1 plays a role in cell wall remodeling even in the absence of other environmental stimuli, a role that is consistent with ARG1's function within the endomembrane delivery system.4.4.4. Corrected genes The 102 genes in the Corrected group (Fig. 4A, Categories II and III) represent a truly unique and fascinating category of genes—these are genes that, while required for spaceflight adaptation, would not have been revealed by a spaceflight-to-ground comparison in WT cells. About a tenth of the 102 genes corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO cells in the spaceflight transcriptome are associated with transport processes. Genes encoding proteins that play a role in the transport of amino acids (Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein), small molecules (MATE efflux family protein, RSH2 root hair specific 2), water (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein), sugar (SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F), metal ions (HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5), and protons (NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2) all had expression adjusted to levels comparable to the spaceflight transcriptome of WT cells. This is another instance where the association of ARG1 with intracellular vesicle trafficking (Boonsirichai et al., 2003) supports a role for ARG1 in spaceflight adaptation, as cells lacking Arg1 show impairment in the intracellular transport among cell compartments. Further, the abundance of the transporter genes brought to the WT expression levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome could suggest that the transmembrane transport processes may be affected by a reduced gravity environment and that a certain level of transporter gene expression is required to assure the efficient continuum of their performance. Genes associated with hormone-mediated signaling are also well represented among the genes that are corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome. Examples include WD domain, G-beta repeat protein gene, SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, and UNS2 Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases (NAT) These genes are associated primarily with plant growth, cell expansion and architecture, and morphogenesis (Lehman et al., 1996; Schwab et al., 2003; Saedler et al., 2009; Nomoto et al., 2012), suggesting that the cell growth may need to be adjusted in spaceflight and that a certain level expression of development-related genes may be required.4.4.5. Compensated genes There were 107 genes that appear to help compensate for the lack of Arg1 in cells (Fig. 4A Category IV; Fig. 4B). Together, these 107 genes define the genotype-specific strategy employed by cells lacking an active Arg1 gene to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment, and provide a link to the role of Arg1 in adapting to spaceflight (Fig. 6). Genes associated with cell-wall metabolism figure prominently in this category. For example, genes participating primarily in molecular grafting of xyloglucan chains such as At1g68560, alpha-xylosidase 1, and the two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, XTH9 (At4g03210) and XTH4 (At2g06850), were significantly downregulated in ARG1 KO in spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. This activity suggests that the process of splitting and/or reconnection of the xyloglucan cross-links in the cell wall occurred in the spaceflight in cells lacking Arg1 in a manner different from WT cells. Further, the repression of these cell-wall remodeling genes indicates that cell-wall loosening processes and cell expansion were diminished in spaceflight when Arg1 gene is absent. It is well documented that cell wall remodeling is a component of both spaceflight adaptation and as a response to hypergravity (Nedukha, 1997; Soga et al., 1999, 2002; Paul et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015). The synthesis and assembly of many cell wall components are dependent on the Golgi apparatus and transport vesicles to the plasma membrane. Genes involved in intracellular transport were also highly represented in those differentially expressed in spaceflight transcriptomes when Arg1 function was disabled. For instance, the genes associated with vesicle-mediated transport such as Prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 (At5g56230), SRP54 signal recognition particle (At5g49500) of the signal recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum, SOS1 sodium proton exchanger (At2g01980) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, and a Clathrin adaptor complex protein (At4g35410) were all differentially expressed in the spaceflight samples between ARG1 KO and WT cells. The endomembrane system, intracellular transport, and vesicle trafficking genes were also a large part of the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, although the individual representative genes differed from those engaged in the ARG1 KO cells. This finding reinforces the conclusion that these processes are sensitive to the reduced-gravity environment and that cells handle them differently depending on ARG1 availability. The importance of vesicle trafficking and intracellular transport has also been identified in ground studies that demonstrated mutants of a vacuolar membrane system genes exhibited agravitropic phenotypes (Kato et al., 2002; Surpin, 2014). In addition, ground studies have shown that chemical treatments that disrupt gravitropism cause aberrant endomembrane morphologies, particularly of vacuoles, which underscores the link between the endomembrane system and gravitropism in plants (Surpin et al., 2005). If indeed ARG1 executes its role in the adaptation to spaceflight microgravity through the endomembrane system, then the link of the endomembrane system to gravity sensing in the specialized cells of the plant root could be extended to include undifferentiated cells as well. Connecting ARG1 to gravity perception in undifferentiated cells would imply a universal, cell-type independent tool for gravity sensing in plants. Another group of genes in this category associate with gravitropism on the ground through auxin signaling and cell polarity. POL, a Protein phosphatase 2C family protein (At2g46920) and the GRAS family transcription factor SGR7 (SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 7-At4g37650) showed substantially diminished expression level in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. POL plays a role in establishing and maintaining the stem cell polarity and localization of auxin signaling (Gagne et al., 2008), and SRG7 is involved in radial organization of the root and shoot axial organs that are responsible for directing asymmetric cell division (Koizumi et al., 2012). The most prominent example of ARG1 engagement in establishing cell polarity occurs in root statocytes upon gravistimulation and is a basis for root gravitropism. In ground studies, ARG1 KO plants exhibit increased auxin accumulation in root tips, which then results in a strong defect in root gravitropism (Sedbrook et al., 1998). Although ARG1 protein is likely to play a role in enabling auxin redistribution in statocytes, ARG1's wide association with the endomembrane system and cytoskeleton suggests a more diverse role in gravity sensing in plants, which is actually well aligned with the concept that ARG1 might be important to undifferentiated cells. ARG1 might mediate gravity signal transduction in undifferentiated cells by promoting the folding, targeting, or degradation of gravitropic regulators in the vicinity of the cytoskeletal network. The observation that the genes related to the gravity sensing and signaling were compensated in the ARG1 KO cells suggests that alternative systems to the ARG1 exist and were required for successful spaceflight adaptation. 4.5. BRIC-16 This experiment is the second time that Arabidopsis cell cultures were sent into space. The first cell culture experiment was launched to the ISS in 2010 on STS131 (BRIC-16) (Paul et al., 2012). These two BRIC cell culture experiments were substantially different in many aspects. First, the cells used in BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 were of different “ages” before launch, as defined by the amount of time grown on solid media after being transferred from liquid culture. The BRIC-16 cells spent an additional week on solid media compared to the BRIC-17 cells. Second, the BRIC-17 cultures were freshly established, while the BRIC-16 culture had been established as a culture line for years. When the new mutant (ARG1 KO) cell line was created, we simultaneously created the comparable WT line to minimize physiological differences in the two BRIC-17 lines. And finally, besides the differences in the biological material, there were differences in the experimental profile of BRIC-17 as compared to BRIC-16: the space vehicle used to launch to the ISS, the mission profile, and the days spent in microgravity (Table S9). The spaceflight transcriptomes of the WT cells of BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 CEL had only one differentially expressed gene in common (At5g62710, a protein kinase). However, the general patterns of gene expression in both experiments suggest they held many of the same strategies of physiological adaptation in common. In BRIC-16, although the largest category of genes induced were heat-shock genes, among the next most highly differentially expressed genes were those associated with pathogen response, wounding, and cell wall remodeling; a pattern that is closely aligned with the current study (Paul et al., 2012). The WT cells used in both experiments were of identical genotype; thus the most likely explanation for the paucity of coordinately expressed genes between the two spaceflight experiments is that each cell line began their respective flights with a ground transcriptome profile that reflected environmental and developmental parameters unique to each experiment. The BRIC-16 cells may have already engaged a series of adaptive strategies that were not necessary in the WT cells of BRIC-17; it is likely that the abundance of heat-shock and stress-response genes in the BRIC-16 spaceflight transcriptome pattern was related to a more stressful ground state before launch. Thus, the age and “stress level” of the cell lines before launch make a substantial difference in how the cells respond to the spaceflight environment. However, the very fact that they are different has provided valuable insight into the response that these cells—any cells—have to the novel environment of space. And yet, on this background, these cells also expressed and repressed the genes necessary to engage in cell-wall remodeling processes that now seem to be a hallmark of spaceflight physiological adaptation.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions The results presented here suggest that there is more to understanding spaceflight adaptation than identifying genes that are changed in expression as WT cells adjust to spaceflight. There are also genes whose activity at certain levels is required for spaceflight adaptation but whose expression levels need not be changed from that which occurs on the ground. Those important but nonchanging genes are revealed by comparing expression patterns between WT and mutant lines. In a very real sense, limiting the list of genes required for spaceflight adaptation to those that need to be changed only in WT cells can restrict insight into the full scope of the spaceflight physiological adaptation process. The Arg1 gene appears to have a major role in spaceflight adaptation of cultured cells, perhaps through gravity sensing, in these nonspecialized, undifferentiated cells. The major ARG1 role seems to relate to its association with the endomembrane system, mediation of the proper localization/targeting or activity of proteins at the plasma membrane or at organelles of the secretory pathway. These data imply that Arg1 also has a function in spaceflight adaptation in differentiated cells within intact plants. Moreover, these data suggest that the genotype, and therefore the physiological state of a cell, can have a dramatic effect on the expression profile of genes needed for spaceflight adaptation. These data also further reinforce the conclusions drawn from a growing body of plant spaceflight literature that suggest that at least one underlying theme of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment is cell-wall remodeling.",

Copyright notice ID: 8024390 PMID: 29088549 Abstract Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight. Key Words: ARG1—Spaceflight—Gene expression—Physiological adaptation—BRIC. Astrobiology 17, 1077–1111.1. Introduction Most multicellular organisms have specialized organs, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedicated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensing columella cells found in the plant root tip (Sato et al., 2015). However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cells and organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity (Paul et al., 2012). Yet the fundamental question of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remains unanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth and provide unique experimental information about gravity-sensing mechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceflight (Rea et al., 2016; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceflight advances fundamental knowledge about how cells recognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare for long-term space exploration. Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled organisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they are indeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by the spaceflight environment. In the microgravity of spaceflight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reflected in, differential gene expression when compared to living on the ground (Salmi and Roux, 2008; Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in microgravity (Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the response of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to spaceflight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation to spaceflight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plants deficient in a known gravity-sensing gene: Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1). Several reasons contributed to the selection of Arg1 for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence that Arg1 functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots (Sedbrook et al., 1998; Blancaflor, 2013). During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efflux carrier proteins—such as PIN2 and PIN3—to the basal side of the statocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap (Abas et al., 2006; Harrison and Masson, 2008b; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). Although this process has not been demonstrated in non-statocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Several additional characteristics made Arg1 a particularly interesting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells. Arg1 is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specific gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does not appear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typified by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism (Guan et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009; Morita and Nakamura, 2012). Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 is localized throughout the endosomal/secretory pathway, enabling it to interact with both vesicular trafficking and integral membrane proteins (Boonsirichai et al., 2003). ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009); thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conserved J domain at ARG1's N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signal transduction (Caplan et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1995), also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. The J-domain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperones by interacting with HSC70 (Young et al., 2003), and the ARG1/HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role in protein transfer (Jouhet and Gray, 2009; Su and Li, 2010). HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceflight in several plant systems (reviewed in Schüler et al., 2015), including undifferentiated cells (Paul et al., 2012; Zupanska et al., 2013), strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to a J domain, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton (Sedbrook et al., 1999; Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Harrison and Masson, 2008a). The cytoskeleton is central to many models of single-cell gravity sensing (Ingber, 1999; Vorselen et al., 2014), and actin has been specifically implicated in gravisensing (Kamada et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2015). Thus ARG1's extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undifferentiated cells. Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to comparable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceflight environment on these cells. The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight environment and, in particular, test the effect of removing Arg1, a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utilization of this mutant also revealed genes important to spaceflight adaptation that would not normally be recognized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceflight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the level that is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceflight in WT cells. However, if the expression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WT levels to enable spaceflight adaptation. Thus the altered expression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceflight adaptation. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1's role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specific, differentiated cells and organs for environmental sensing.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Concept of operations and comparison approach When a cell transitions from Earth to orbit, it responds and begins to adjust its metabolism to the stimuli offered by the new environment. In this experiment, the patterns of gene expression established after 10 days of growth in the BRIC hardware were used to illuminate the strategies undifferentiated cells used to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between cells grown in the two environments: spaceflight and the comparable ground controls. The genes identified in this “vertical” comparison reflected physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment within each genotype. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes. The genes identified in this “horizontal” genotype comparison showed the impact of removing ARG1 from metabolic processes in both the normal ground control environment as well as in the spaceflight environment. Comparing gene expression patterns revealed potential roles for ARG1 in both environments. An overview is shown in Fig. 1 and details of the approach provided below. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Graphical presentation of the two approaches used in the microarray data analysis. (A) ARG1 KO and WT mark the gene expression profiles for respective cell samples. Solid arrows represent the direction of comparison of the gene expression profiles. The red box and arrows indicate the first approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between cells grown in the two environments: spaceflight and the comparable ground controls. The green box and arrow indicate the first part of the second approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes on the ground. The blue box and arrow indicate the second part of the second approach for data analysis—differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes in spaceflight. (B) Microarray data comparison groups used to obtain the significantly differentially expressed genes between the samples.This first analytical approach involves the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of spaceflight-grown cells to the ground controls for each of the two cell lines, thereby characterizing the physiological adaptation of each genotype to spaceflight (red box in Fig. 1A and red arrows in 1B). Genes identified in WT cells contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to microgravity and spaceflight. If physiological adaptation to spaceflight depends entirely on functional Arg1, then the ARG1 KO cell line would be in severe decline, and the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles would reflect that stress. If ARG1 is not involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight, then the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles from ARG1 KO cells would be largely the same as WT. However if ARG1 functions simply as part of the pathways engaged by spaceflight, then the pattern of genes differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight will differ between WT and the knock-out cell line but retain some degree of overlap. The second analytical approach involves the comparison of gene expression profiles between WT and ARG1 KO cells both on the ground and during spaceflight (green and blue box of Fig. 1A and green and blue arrows of 1B). This approach reveals gene expression differences in the cells adapted to either environment with a disabled Arg1 gene. Since ARG1 has a role in typical cell maintenance, it was likely that the gene expression profiles of ARG1 KO cell culture would differ from WT in the ground environment, as a knock-out cell line would adapt its metabolism to compensate for the absence of the important gene. Since the gene expression patterns on the ground will likely affect the nature of adaptation to spaceflight, it is important to compare the gene expression profiles between the two genotypes of the ground controls (green box of Fig. 1A and green arrows of 1B). Finally, every individual gene engaged in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight experiment was examined in the ARG1 KO cells to determine whether the gene was similarly expressed or changed in the knock-out line. If a gene was changed in the same way in both genotypes, then we concluded it was Arg1 independent. However, if a gene was not engaged in the ARG1 KO cells, or was engaged in a different manner than in the WT cells, then the expression of that gene in the WT adaptation to spaceflight was determined to be dependent upon ARG1 function. 2.1.1. The CEL experiment of BRIC-17 The CEL experiment setup and organization was a modification of a previous Arabidopsis cell culture experiment in BRIC-16 (Paul et al., 2012). The CEL BRIC-17 experiment was launched on board the Dragon capsule of the SpaceX-2 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the ISS on 1 March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the BRIC hardware. The BRIC hardware remains stationary after it is de-stowed from the Dragon Capsule and deployed to the ISS. The BRIC hardware does not have a centrifuge component, nor is it compatible with the limited centrifuge facilities on the ISS, such as the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) centrifuge. Additional hardware details and BRIC illustrations can be found in Paul et al. (2012). The experiment made a direct comparison of spaceflight-grown cells to those grown as controls on the ground for the purpose of exploring the complete range of effects that spaceflight presents to plant cells, which includes but is not limited to the effects of microgravity. Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC-17 payload. Each chamber housed five PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60 mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were two plates with WT cells and three plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRIC containers on the ground in the International Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as ground controls. The ground controls were initiated with a 48 h delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed on the ISS with RNAlater™ (Ambion) on the 10th day on orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri plate. Twenty four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), where it resided until cold stowage transport back to Earth within the Dragon capsule. After returning to Earth, the samples were reclaimed at KSC and then transported to the University of Florida laboratories. As described below, the total RNA was extracted from spaceflight samples and corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays. Although the BRIC hardware has virtually no air circulation, no gas exchange, and no light, that hardware configuration is not substantially different from the normal growing conditions of the undifferentiated tissue culture cells, which are typically grown in sealed Petri plates in the dark (Johnson et al., 2015).2.2. Tissue culture cell lines Arabidopsis callus cultures were established de novo from well-established plant lines available through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, www.arabidopsis.org) and are indicated below. Each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 × solution), 2,4-D (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were then transferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 × solution) and 2,4-D (0.5 mL/L) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lines each of Col-0 ecotype were the subject of this study: WT and arg1, the latter being a knock-out line generated from the ARG1 T-DNA insertion (SALK_024542C). The arg1 cell line is referred to as ARG1 KO throughout. The SALK line was obtained through TAIR. The SALK mutant line (arg1-3) is characterized by a T-DNA insertion at position 952 (in an intron). Although the mutated gene can produce a truncated transcript, it is not functional, and arg1-3 is considered a null allele (Gleeson et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013).2.3. Preparation of BRIC-17 CEL cell culture plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were transferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, the material washed once with fresh liquid media, and then the sample was decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, USA) that contained 6.5 mL nutrient agar media [MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D MES buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)]. The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to ensure sterility of both the interior and exterior of the plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher), and then driven to KSC. The BRIC-17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time.2.4. RNA extractions Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).2.5. Microarrays cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.). Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 μg/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45°C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceflight and ground control, five plates of WT and four plates of ARG1 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 2.5.1. Microarrays data analysis Affymetrix Expression Console Software (Version 1.3) was used to generate .CEL files for each RNA hybridization. All analysis was performed in R 3.0.0 and Bioconductor version 2.12 (R Development Core Team, 2012). Background adjustment, summarization, and quantile normalization were performed using Limma package (Smyth, 2004). Normalization was made using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 normalization algorithm (Hubbell et al., 2002). Data quality was assessed using the arrayQualityMetrics package and various QC charts (Density & Intensity plot, NUSE, RLE, and RNA Degradation Plot). Probes that had absent signals in all samples were removed. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from spaceflight samples was compared to the probe-set signal value of ground control samples to give gene expression ratios. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Limma package with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed with stringent criteria at p value <0.01, abs Fold Change >2 (−1 < FC log2 > +1; labeled as log2 Fold Change) unless stated otherwise. The microarray data are publicly available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the  () data repository under accession number GSE81442.2.5.2. Comparison groups The groups outlined in the concept of operations and comparisons were established and abbreviated with combination of two capital letters and a short version of the cell line name in superscript (Fig. 1B). Letters are as follows: G for ground control, F for spaceflight; superscripts are Wt for WT cells, Arg for ARG1 KO cells.2.6. Functional gene categorization, Gene Ontology annotations Gene function was annotated by associations of controlled vocabularies or keywords to data objects (Gene Ontology, GO). Multiple GO toolkits of this controlled vocabulary system were used to collect annotations of gene function. Various lists of gene names were created, and enrichment GO terms were searched after statistical tests from precalculated backgrounds. All three aspects of gene products (molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location) described by GO-controlled vocabularies were considered. A significance level of 0.05 and five genes as minimum number of mapping entries were implemented for the analysis parameters in the following tools. AgriGO: An integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community AgriGO was used (Du et al., 2010). AgriGO query criteria were as follows: Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Arabidopsis gene model (TAIR9) precomputed background, Fisher was selected as a statistical test method of choice with NOT-adjust multi-test adjustment method, Significance level was set at 0.01 or 0.05, Minimum number of mapping of entries was set at five, Plant GO slim was selected from other GO types. The Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value (FDR) was calculated manually using R function on the significant GO terms. For Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE), selected species was Arabidopsis thaliana, NOT-adjust was selected for multitest adjustment method, significance level was set at 0.05, Minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 10, and Plant GO slim was selected from other GO types. AmiGO: If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II: ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabidopsis was also used (Obayashi et al., 2009). Making gene function table function was implemented to retrieve organized information on gene function (based on TAIR annotation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProfiler: A web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists was used. Arabidopsis thaliana was a selected organism with most of the default options except the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR significance threshold was selected (Reimand et al., 2007).2.7. Real quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR The total RNA (850 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One-tenth of total cDNA was used as a template for a single RT-qPCR run. RT-qPCR was carried out using TaqMan™ technology on the ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) reagent was used for the duplex RT-qPCR reaction with 6FAM and VIC-dye labeled, TAMRA-quenched probes. In all reactions the Ubq11 (At4g05050) served as an internal control. Each duplex PCR mixture contained 900 nM target gene-specific forward and reverse primers each, 150 nM Ubq11 forward and reverse primers each, 250 nM 6FAM labeled target gene-specific probe, and 250 nM VIC-labeled Ubq11 probe. Primers and probes were designed with Primer Express software and supplied by Applied Biosystems. The primers/probes sequences shown as 5′→3′ were as follows: Ubq11 (At4g05050) forward: AACTTGAGGA CGGCAGAACTTT, reverse: GTGATGGTCTTTCCGGTC AAA3, probe: VIC-CAGAAGGAGTCTACGCTTCATTT GGTCTTGC-TAMRA; Agp12 (At3g13520) forward: TCT CCGCCGTAGGAAACGT, reverse: AGCATCGGAAGT AGGACTTGGA, probe: 6FAM-CTGCGCAGACAGAG GCTCCGG-TAMRA; Skb1 (At4g31120) forward: TGATACCTCAGAGGGACTGAATGAT, reverse: GCTTAC TGTCATGCTCACAAAGAAG, probe: 6FAM-CCTGGGA GCTGTGGAATTCGTTTCG-TAMRA; HsfA2 (At2g26150) forward: GGTGTGCTTGTAGCTGAGGTAGTTAG, reverse: TGCTCCATAGCTGCAACTTGA, probe: 6FAM-TTGAGGCAACAGCAACACAGCTCCA-TAMRA. Real quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was performed as reported previously. Briefly, the thermal cycling program consisted of 20 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C, and 30 s at 59°C. Reactions were quantified by threshold cycle, Ct. Primers and probe sets were first subjected to validation experiments to test the efficiency of the target and reference amplifications. The Ct values for respective number of biological replicas of each experimental group (treated, control) were analyzed using 7500 Software v2.0.5 along with Microsoft Excel and the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method. The ΔCt was calculated as the difference between the threshold cycle value of a target gene and that of Ubq11 (endogenous control) in the same sample, while ΔΔCt was calculated as the difference between the ΔCt value of a treated sample and that of the control (calibrator). The fold difference of the target gene expression in treated samples relative to control samples (calibrator) was calculated as 2^(–ΔΔCt) and then log2-transformed.3. Results Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments: spaceflight cells and comparable ground controls, which reflected the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two genotypes: WT and ARG1 KO cells, which provide a comparison of cell responses in spaceflight and on the ground. Figure 1A and 1B illustrates the matrix that was used to compare the two genotypes and two environmental conditions of this experiment: Ground Control WT (GWt), Ground Control ARG1 KO (GArg), Spaceflight WT (FWt), and Spaceflight ARG1 KO (FArg). The specifics of each comparison follow. 3.1. The Arg1 expression across samples The Arg1 transcript level in the ARG1 KO cells is substantially lower (6.4-fold) than in WT cells; however, this difference did not register as statistically significant. The average raw transcript of the Arg1 gene in the four biological replicates of the WT ground control cells is 307, whereas the average raw Arg1 transcript in the three biological replicas of the ARG1 KO ground control cells is 48. The value from the ARG1 KO cells was derived from three replicate values that were sufficiently dissimilar (80, 11, 53) as to be scored as not statistically valid. There was virtually no difference in Arg1 transcript levels between the ground and the spaceflight samples in either WT cells or ARG1 KO cells. The average raw transcript level of Arg1 in the four biological replicas of the WT spaceflight cells was 313 compared to that expression in WT cells on the ground, 307 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Data are available at http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/ast.2016.1538). The average raw Arg1 gene expression in the three biological replicas of the ARG1 KO spaceflight cells was 25 compared to 48 in ARG1 KO cells on the ground. Although Arg1 transcription itself does not appear to be influenced by the spaceflight environment, the impact of removing a functional Arg1 gene has a dramatic effect on the expression patterns of many other genes (see following sections).3.2. Differentially expressed genes in all four comparison groups 3.2.1. Alterations in the expression of 78 genes characterize the physiological adaptation of WT cells to spaceflight—FWt : GWt The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment were identified for WT cells by comparing the gene expression profiles in WT spaceflight cells (FWt) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the FWt : GWt group comparison (Fig. 1B). In that comparison 78 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell treatments at p value <0.01 and log2 Fold Change >1; 46 genes were upregulated, and 32 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S1 Gene list 78). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab The number of the significantly differentially expressed genes identified in all comparison groups. The color code corresponds to the color of arrows in Fig.1: red represents the significantly differentially expressed genes of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, green represents significantly differentially expressed genes of the ground transcriptome, and blue represents significantly differentially expressed genes of the spaceflight transcriptome.The functional annotation of the genes of the FWt : GWt group comparison indicated that genes of the endomembrane system, Golgi apparatus, and plant-type cell wall were highly represented in the WT adaptation to spaceflight. For instance, genes localized to Golgi apparatus were all upregulated in the WT spaceflight cells compared to the ground counterparts (e.g., At3g18260 Reticulon family protein; At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2 protein disulfide isomerase-like 1-2 localized to the endomembrane system; At4g07960 CSLC12 cellulose-synthase-like C12 and At2g03760 ST1 sulphotransferase 12; Table 1 GO 78; Table S1 Gene list 78). The defense response group was also highly represented among the Biological Process ontology (gProfiler, TAIR, AgriGO), with pathogen/cell wall–associated genes At3g43250, At2g44490 (PEN2), and At2g03760 (ST1) being upregulated.

Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.2.2. Cells lacking functional Arg1 changed the expression of 130 genes to adapt to spaceflight, and those genes were fundamentally different than those of WT cells—FArg : GArg The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment were identified for ARG1 KO cells by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells (FArg) to ARG1 KO ground control cells (GArg) in the FArg : GArg group comparison of (Fig. 1B). There were 130 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at p value <0.01 and log2 Fold Change >1; 68 genes were upregulated, and 62 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S2 Gene list 130). The functional annotation of the genes of the FArg : GArg group comparison indicated that physiological adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells relied on metabolic processes distinct from those used in WT cells. Genes of the cell periphery from the GO Cellular Components category, response to hormone and response to lipid, and xyloglucan metabolic process of the GO Biological Processes, and transporter activity from the GO Molecular Function categories, were highly represented among the genes ARG1 KO cells differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight. For example, three genes of the cell wall–related xyloglucan metabolic processes (At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1; At4g03210 XTH9 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 9 and At2g06850 XTH4 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 4) were substantially downregulated in spaceflight ARG1 KO cells (Table S2 Gene list 130; Table 2 GO 130), whereas cell wall–associated genes were upregulated in WT cells. Genes encoding cellular transporters were generally upregulated in ARG KO as compared to their ground counterparts' cells; examples include At1g80510 Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein, At2g38330 MATE efflux family protein, At2g36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, At1g63440 HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5, At3g14770 SWEET2 Nodulin MtN3 family protein, At3g05030 NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, and At1g72700, a E1-E2 type ATPase family.

The genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptomes between ARG1 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO ground cells (GArg) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the GArg : GWt group comparison of Fig. 1B. The 90 genes were differentially expressed due to the Arg1 mutation on the ground with approximately as many genes upregulated (39) as downregulated (51) (Fig. 2; Table S3 Gene list 90). Many genes with adjusted expression to the Arg1 mutation on the ground classified as plasma membrane, membrane, and cell periphery Cellular Component ontology (gProfiler). For instance, genes At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein localized to the membrane and participating in the defense response and At4g40070 RING/U-box superfamily protein localized to the extracellular region were upregulated. On the other hand, genes At4g30660 Low temperature and salt responsive, At2g36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, At3g26830 PAD3 PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 had substantially diminished expression level in ARG1 KO cells on the ground than WT cells (Table 3 GO 90; Table S3 Gene list 90). The heterocycle metabolic process and organelle organization were among the Biological Process ontology terms represented by genes affected by Arg1 mutation on the ground. For instance, genes At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER, chromosome maintenance genes At4g02060 PRL Minichromosome maintenance (MCM2/3/5) family protein, and At5g48600 SMC3 structural maintenance of chromosome 3 had diminished expression on the ground in ARG1 KO cells relative to WT cells.

Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.2.4. Comparison of the gene expression profiles between ARG1 KO and WT genotypes during spaceflight shows unique genotype-specific expression patterns—FArg : FWt The genes differentially expressed between ARG1 KO cells and WT cells in the spaceflight environment were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells (FArg) to WT spaceflight cells (FWt) in the FArg : FWt group comparison (Fig. 1B). There were 107 genes significantly differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cell samples in spaceflight (Fig. 2). Nearly half the genes were upregulated in ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight and half downregulated as compared to WT cells in spaceflight (Table S4 Gene list 107). Many genes differentially expressed between the WT and ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight were classified in GO Biological Processes ontology (gProfiler, AgriGO) as transport and establishment of localization, developmental, and xyloglucan metabolic processes (Table 4 GO 107; Table S4 Gene list 107). Interestingly, the genes related to transport processes (At4g37640 ACA2 calcium ATPase 2, At2g01980 SOS1 sodium proton exchanger, At5g49500 SRP54 Signal recognition particle, At5g03280 PIR2 NRAMP metal ion transporter, At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex, At2g26900 BASS2 Sodium Bile acid symporter, and At1g22710 SUT1 sucrose-proton symporter 2) all showed much reduced expression in spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells as compared to WT cells. Similarly, all four genes associated with the xyloglucan metabolic process (At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1, At4g03210 XTH9 xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 9, At1g11545 XTH8, and At2g06850 XTH4) were also significantly diminished in the spaceflight ARG1 KO cells compared to the spaceflight WT cells. Finally, 14 genes out of 15 representing the transporter activity term of the Molecular Function ontology were also under-expressed in ARG1 KO spaceflight cells as compared to WT spaceflight cells (Table S4 Gene list 107).

Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.3. Physiological adaptation to spaceflight of ARG1 KO cells is fundamentally different from WT cells—comparing FWt : GWt to FArg : GArg Most of the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells were fundamentally different than those engaged in WT cells. When the 130 genes differentially expressed in the FArg : GArg group comparison were compared to the 78 genes differentially expressed in the FWt : GWt group comparison, only three genes changed in the exact same way: At3g08590 putative 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, At3g30843 hypothetical protein, and At5g56270 transcription factor WRKY2 (Fig. 2, Table S1 Gene list 78 and Table S2 Gene list 130). These three genes, therefore, constitute the only genes of the WT response that are totally independent of ARG1 function. The remaining 127 genes of the ARG1 adaptation to the spaceflight environment constitute an adaptation unique to the ARG1 KO genotype.3.4. The gene expression patterns on the ground play a fundamental role in the gene expression patterns of spaceflight—comparing GArg : GWt The information about the expression pattern of the 90 genes differentially expressed on the ground between the WT and ARG1 KO cells, GArg : GWt, was assessed in all other comparison groups: the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, FWt : GWt, the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, and between genotypes in spaceflight, FArg : FWt (Fig. 3). FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Heat map visualizing the expression patterns of the 90 differentially expressed genes in the ground transcriptome between the WT and ARG1 KO cells (GArg : GWt) as arranged into Categories I–III by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (GArg : GWt, FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, FArg : FWt). Category I Corrected—25 genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome engaged in the ARG1 KO in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight to match the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category II Required—12 genes differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome at the level required for the spaceflight transcriptome, engaged in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells; these genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category III—53 genes showed significant differential expression in the ground transcriptome (GArg : GWt) alone. These genes showed differential expression in GArg : GWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt.The 25 genes of the 90 (GArg : GWt) showed significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, but no significant differential expression in WT cells, FWt : GWt (Fig. 3, Category I). Thus the ARG1 KO cells corrected the expression of those genes as they adapted to spaceflight, apparently to reestablish the WT level of expression that is needed in that environment. These genes included, for example, At1g32950 (Subtilase genes commonly associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism) and At2g36830 (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein) (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3).

Blank cells indicate that the gene was not significantly differentially expressed in a respective comparison group. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.The 12 genes out of 90 (GArg : GWt) showed significant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells (FWt : GWt) but no significant expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) (Fig. 3, Category II). This genotype-based change in the ARG1 KO ground control cells resulted in the expression levels of these genes on the ground matching the WT expression levels in spaceflight. There was a single gene (At2g40020, hypothetical histone-lysine N-methyltransferase protein) among these 12 with an unusual behavior, as it was also differentially expressed in spaceflight between the two genotypes. However all 12 genes were considered to be expressed in the ARG1 KO on the ground at the level required for the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight. These genes included genes associated with the extracellular region (e.g., At1g30600 Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 lipase; At1g13080 CYP71B2 cytochrome P450; At1g07380 ceramidase activity; At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism; Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). The 53 genes out of 90 (GArg : GWt) showed no differential expression in any other comparison group (Fig. 3, Category III). Thus, although the gene expression patterns between genotypes on the ground were different, both cell lines likely made only small adjustments to gene expression, which resulted in no change in expression levels when the two genotypes from spaceflight were compared. Some of these genes represented plasma membrane and membrane related processes: At4g11850 PLDGAMMA1 phospholipase D gamma, At2g02170 Remorin family protein, At5g52440 HCF106 Bacterial sec-independent translocation protein mttA/Hcf1061 importing protein into chloroplast thylakoid membrane, At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). With the exception of At2g40020, none of the 90 genes that were differentially expressed between genotypes on the ground (GArg : GWt) showed differential expression between genotypes in the spaceflight environment (FArg : FWt).3.5. Corrected and compensated expression 3.5.1. Corrected expression: the patterns of the genes associated with spaceflight physiological adaptation affected by Arg1 mutation—comparing FArg : GArg, FWt : GWt, and FArg : FWt Information about the differential expression of the 130 genes differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). Each of the 130 genes was significantly differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg and could be also significantly differentially expressed in other comparison groups. There were three genes out of 130 (FArg : GArg) that showed significant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and no differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt; Fig. 4, Category I). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab (A) The heat map visualization of the 130 differentially expressed genes of the physiological adaptation in the ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg), as arranged into Categories I–IV by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FArg : GArg, FWt : GWt, GArg : GWt, FArg : FWt). Category I Independent—3 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells changed in the same way as in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category II Corrected—25 genes being part of the 102 pool of genes were differentially expressed in the ground transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells and were corrected during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells to achieve the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Corrected PATTERN 1 102 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category III Corrected—77 genes being part of the 102 pool of genes, corrected during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells to achieve the WT expression level in the spaceflight transcriptome, the gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Corrected PATTERN 1 102 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Category IV Compensated—25 genes being part of the 107 pool of genes (see Fig. 4B) that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment as they showed differential expression between ARG1 KO and WT cells in the spaceflight transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. (B) The heat map visualization of the 107 differentially expressed genes in the spaceflight transcriptome between WT and ARG1 KO cells (FArg : FWt) as arranged into Categories I–III by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FArg : FWt, FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt). Category I Compensated—25 genes being part of the 107 pool of genes (see Fig. 4A) that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 2 25 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt. Category II Compensated—13 genes being part of the 82 genes in the 107 pool of genes that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 3 82 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt (except one gene). Category III Compensated—69 genes being part of the 82 genes in the 107 pool of genes that represent the compensated genotypic adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression pattern was graphically represented in the box labeled Compensated PATTERN 3 82 genes. These genes showed differential expression in FArg : FWt, no differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, and no differential expression in GArg : GWt.There were 102 genes out of 130 (FArg : GArg) that showed no significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells, FWt : GWt group comparison and no differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt (Fig. 4, Category II). Thus, these 102 genes are potentially genes whose expression needs correction from the ground genotype of ARG1 KO so as to be returned to a necessary expression level for spaceflight adaptation. These 102 genes represented genes typically associated with the cell periphery, endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus, plastid and chloroplast of the Cellular Component as well as the single-organism localization and transport and signaling of the Biological Process ontology terms. Particularly genes of the transmembrane transport of various moieties were highly represented (e.g., AT1G80510 Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein, AT2G38330 MATE efflux family protein, AT2G36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein, AT5G20280 SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F, AT3G05030 NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, and AT1G71050 HIPP20 Heavy metal transport/detoxification superfamily protein) (Table 6 GO Fig. 4A; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). Genes associated with cell signaling were also found among these 102 genes (AT1G03060 SPI Beige/BEACH domain; WD domain, G-beta repeat protein, AT2G43010 SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, AT3G20410 CPK9 calmodulin-domain protein kinase 9, AT3G16570 RALF23 rapid alkalinization factor 23).

Compensated genes that showed differential expression in the spaceflight transcriptome, regardless of differential expression in the spaceflight adaptation of ARG1 KO cells. Blank cells indicate that the gene was not significantly differentially expressed in a respective comparison group. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.3.5.2. Compensated adaptation, revealing adaptive strategies to spaceflight—comparing FArg : FWt, FWt : GWt, and FArg : GArg The information about the differential expression of the 107 genes differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group (FArg : FWt) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight of WT cells (FWt : GWt) group comparison and in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg (Fig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). Each of the 107 genes was significantly differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt and could be also significantly differentially expressed in other comparison group, but this was not a required feature of the categorical response. There were 25 genes of 107 (FArg : FWt) that showed significant differential expression in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg group comparison (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B Category I). There were 82 genes of 107 (FArg : FWt) that showed no significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg : GArg (Fig. 4B Category II and III). Some of these 82 genes were associated with components of the extracellular region, cell wall, external encapsulating structure, cell periphery, plasma membrane, endomembrane system, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus of the Cellular Compartment ontology terms (gProfiler). Also, cellular aromatic compound metabolic process, localization, and transmembrane transport were represented among the Biological Process ontology terms. Two genes represented the cellular aromatic compound metabolic process (At4g37650 SHR GRAS family transcription factor and At3g20540 PolIB polymerase gamma 1). Genes involved in sugar transport (e.g., At1g77210 STP14 sugar transporter 14 and At2g43240 Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) and genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport (e.g., At5g56230 PRA1.G2 prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 and At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex small-chain family protein) were representative of other transport processes (Table 7 GO Fig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). With the exception of At2g40020 mentioned above, none of the 107 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the spaceflight genotype comparison group FArg : FWt showed significant differential expression in the ground genotype comparison group GArg : GWt (Fig. 4B).3.5.3. The Arg1-dependent genes in the WT adaptive strategy—comparing FWt : GWt and FArg : GArg The 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells established the base of genes needed to adapt to spaceflight. Each gene of 78 FWt : GWt was categorized into Arg1-independent, Arg1-dependent, or partially Arg1-dependent. A gene was considered Arg1 independent if it showed the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells; thus the same change in gene expression was observed in FWt : GWt and FArg : GArg (Fig. 5A). The expression of such a gene was adapted to the spaceflight environment in the same fashion regardless of the Arg1 mutation. There were three genes where Arg1 seemed to have no role in the physiological adaptation (Fig. 5A Category I; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). FIG. 5. Open in a new tab (A) The effects of the Arg1 mutation on the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The heat map visualization of the 78 differentially expressed genes in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight (FWt : GWt), as arranged into Categories I–IV by the expression profiles in four comparison groups (FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt, FArg : FWt). Independent Group, Category I—3 genes showed same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells and showed no differential expression in either transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Dependent Group, Category II—12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT but were voided during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment when Arg1 was mutated. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. Dependent Group, Category III—12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells and differential expression in the ground transcriptome between ARG1 KO and WT, matching the WT spaceflight expression level. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. Partially Dependent Group, Category IV—51 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells alone. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, no differential expression in FArg : GArg, no differential expression in GArg : GWt, and no differential expression in FArg : FWt. (B) The distribution of the genes across dependence groups with relaxed p value requirements. Heat map visualization of the 78 genes differentially expressed in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight (FWt : GWt) across all group comparisons (FWt : GWt, FArg : GArg, GArg : GWt, and FArg : FWt) with increasingly relaxed p value stringency criteria clustered by the dependence pattern. The Category I, II, III, and IV of the respective dependence groups are same as defined in Fig. 5A. Dependent Group, Category V—genes were differentially expressed one way in the WT spaceflight-to-ground transcriptomes and the other way in the ARG1 KO spaceflight-to-ground transcriptomes, and were also opposite in patterns between WT and ARG1 KO within environments. These genes showed differential expression in FWt : GWt, differential expression in FArg : GArg, differential expression in GArg : GWt, and differential expression in FArg : FWt. The column in gray font corresponds to Fig. 5A and the gene distribution at the p value <0.01. The columns in black font summarize the gene number distributions showed on the heat maps. Abbreviations: ND = not detected; .02, .03, .04, .05 = stringency criteria of the p value <0.02, <0.03, <0.04, or <0.05, respectively.A gene was considered Arg1 dependent if it did not show the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in ARG1 KO cells, FArg : GArg, as it did in WT cells FWt : GWt (Fig. 5A). There were 24 genes exhibiting the Arg1 dependence (Fig. 5A Categories II, III, Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). These 24 Arg1-dependent genes could be divided into two categories based on the source of the Arg1 dependency: Category II or III of Fig. 5A. Category II genes of Fig. 5A were not differentially expressed in either the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg) or ground genotype comparison (GArg : GWt), but showed differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison (FArg : FWt). Thus, the absence of a functional Arg1 gene had the impact of rendering the adaptive-to-spaceflight genes unresponsive (Fig. 5A, Category II). The majority of those genes were associated with the endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus or the intracellular membrane-bounded organelle and cell periphery and plasma membrane GO terms of the Cellular Component ontology (e.g., At3g49780, PSK4 phytosulfokine 4 precursor and At2g43240, Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). Category III genes of Fig. 5A were not differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg : GArg), were differentially expressed in ground genotype comparison (GArg: GWt), but showed no differential expression in spaceflight genotype comparison (FArg : FWt). These genes were already altered on the ground in ARG1 KO cells to match the spaceflight expression levels in WT (Fig. 5A, Category III). There were 12 genes showing such an expression pattern, some of which were associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism (e.g., At1g30600, Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 alpha/beta-Hydrolases superfamily protein and At2g44490, PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). Table 8. GO Dependence Fig. 5A Open in a new tab The significant GO terms assigned to the genes in Arg1-Independent, Arg1-Dependent, and Arg1-Partially Dependent categories based on gProfiler and AgriGO functional annotation. Red cells indicate gene overexpression, green cells indicate gene downregulation, and gray cells indicate no significant differential expression. Gene duplicates within oncology were removed and assigned to the most specific available GO term class.There were 51 differentially expressed genes in FWt : GWt that were not significantly differentially expressed in any other comparison group (Fig. 5A, Category IV). These genes were considered Arg1 Partially Dependent as there was not enough statistical support to assign them to either the independent or dependent group. These 51 genes were primarily associated with the GO Biological Process of response to stimulus, with few related to the response to light (e.g., At3g08570 Phototropic-responsive NPH3 family protein, At5g63600 FLS5 flavonol synthase 5, At1g76570 Chlorophyll A-B binding family protein or to high light stimulus At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). The distribution of 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells (FWt : GWt) among the Independent, Dependent, and Partially Dependent was established with increasingly relaxed p value stringency criteria from p value <0.01 through p value <0.05 without changing the stringency of the Fold Change criteria (−1< FC log2 >+1) (Fig. 5B). The number of Independent genes increased from three through five up to six genes. The Dependent genes not only increased in total numbers, but a new group of Dependent genes emerged. The three to four genes showed the new expression pattern such that they were coordinately differentially expressed in WT spaceflight adaptation (FWt : GWt) and in the ground genotype comparison between WT and ARG1 KO cells (GArg : GWt) yet the opposite in the ARG1 KO spaceflight adaptation (FArg : GArg) and in the spaceflight genotype comparison between the WT and ARG1 KO cells (FArg : FWt) (Fig. 5B Category V). The biggest depletion of gene total number was in the Partially Dependent gene pool, from 51 genes at the p value <0.01, through 43, 37, 35, and 31 at the p value <0.05 (Fig. 5B Category IV).3.6. The microarray data validation To validate the correctness of the significance criteria applied in the microarray data analysis, the RT-qPCR was performed. For objectiveness, the target genes were selected from among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the WT spaceflight cells of the BRIC-16 experiment (Paul et al., 2012). The RT-qPCR results aligned with those of the microarray (Supplementary Fig. S2). Only one gene, the Agp12, showed significant under-expression in the spaceflight ARG1 KO cells relative to their ground control counterparts as identified in the microarray data analysis and as measured by the RT-qPCR method. The Agp12 gene target in all other comparison groups as well as the remaining targets across all comparison groups showed no differential expression levels as measured by the means of microarrays or RT-qPCR. The significance stringency criteria applied throughout the microarray analysis seemingly prevent the false-positive or false-negative inclusion.4. Discussion The gene Arg1 was found to have a dramatic influence on the gene expression profiles that define physiological adaptation of cell cultures to spaceflight. Like WT cells, the ARG1 KO cells thrived in the spaceflight environment, suggesting that the presence of ARG1 is not absolutely required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. However, the ARG1 has an essential role in defining the WT adaptation to spaceflight. ARG1 KO cells adapted to spaceflight by expressing different genes, providing unique insight into the alternative pathways for physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight. 4.1. WT adaptation to spaceflight is highly dependent upon Arg1 There were 78 genes differentially expressed in WT when comparing spaceflight to ground control. Those 78 genes comprise the obvious primary set of genes involved in spaceflight physiological adaptation of WT cells. Only three of these 78 genes were similarly changed in ARG1 KO cells, suggesting that only these three were completely independent of Arg1 (See Independent group below and in Fig. 2, Fig. 4A Category I, Fig. 5A Category I). The remaining 75 genes are most likely reliant on Arg1 function. Twenty-four of these genes are definitively dependent upon Arg1 at the highest levels of analytical stringency (Categories II, III of Fig. 5A). The remaining 51 genes are likely to be dependent upon Arg1 but do not reach p value of <0.01 (Category IV of Fig. 5A); however, reducing the required p value level brings more genes from the Partially Dependent group into the clearly Dependent group (Fig. 5B). This result strongly suggests that Arg1 has a prominent role in generating a large part of what would be considered the proper spaceflight gene expression profile for spaceflight adaptation in WT cells.4.2 Without functional Arg1, cells engage a unique gene expression strategy that further illuminates required elements of the WT spaceflight adaptation ARG1 KO cells engaged vastly different genes to adapt to spaceflight than did WT cells, suggesting that not only is Arg1 function required for much of the WT adaptation to spaceflight, but also that cells without Arg1 can compensate for the lack of Arg1 by changing the expression of a different set of genes. This suggests that the genotype, and likely then physiological state, of the cell line on the ground profoundly affects the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The gene expression profiles seen in the ground genotype comparisons suggested that WT and ARG1 KO cells have different gene expression requirements for the maintenance of a healthy physiology in a normal terrestrial environment. The basis for engaging very different genes in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO can be explained along two lines of reasoning. First, some genes involved in WT adaptation to spaceflight were already changed to a spaceflight-adapted level in ARG1 KO on the ground and were therefore not needed to be differentially expressed as the ARG1 KO adapted to spaceflight (Fig. 3 Category II, 12 genes). These genes are Required in that they must be maintained at the WT spaceflight level in order for these cells to adapt to spaceflight. Second, some of the genes that showed differential expression on the ground between the ARG1 KO and WT cells were Corrected to match WT expression levels during the ARG1 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight (Fig. 3 Category I, 25 genes; the same 25 genes found in Fig. 4A Category II). These genes define a new part of the overall landscape of genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight: those which are needed to be at a certain level of expression in spaceflight, but if that level is already present in ground transcriptome, it is not necessary to alter expression patterns to achieve the spaceflight transcriptome. However, if their expression on the ground is altered due to confounding factors, such as a mutant background or physiological stress, then expression levels would need to be corrected for spaceflight transcriptome, thereby revealing essential genes that would otherwise be missed. An additional set of Corrected genes are those that are differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO. The 77 genes from Category III (Fig. 4A) comprise such a group. As with the Category II genes in Fig. 4A, these genes were corrected to WT spaceflight levels during the ARG1 KO adaptation to spaceflight. Taken together, these 77 genes plus the aforementioned 25 reveal 102 genes that comprise a previously unappreciated part of the spaceflight adaptation process. Some of the genes that showed differential expression in ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight adaptation were also differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cells in spaceflight. These 25 genes apparently Compensated for the absence of a functional Arg1 both on the ground and during spaceflight (25 labeled with an asterisk, Fig. 4A, Category IV). These genes would not be a part of the typical WT spaceflight response but are necessary in the ARG1 KO to adapt to spaceflight.4.3. The landscape of genes required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight The landscape of the genetic requirements for spaceflight adaptation is much more complex than is revealed by the genes that are changed in expression in WT cells adapted to spaceflight. The complexity of the physiological adaptive processes related to genotype is represented in the Venn diagram of Fig. 6. In the WT response 78 genes are changed in expression, leading to the conclusion that these are the genes necessary for adaptation. ARG1 KO data suggest that this is an overly simple view of the adaptation requirements of WT cells. ARG1-mutant cells show that many genes whose expression is altered on the ground by that genotype must be corrected to WT levels to adapt to spaceflight. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab The gene landscape for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. At least 180 genes are Important for spaceflight adaptation. These genes were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptomes between WT and ARG1 KO. Seventy-eight genes in WT and 130 in ARG1 KO were differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, thus also between spaceflight and ground. Three of these genes were coordinately expressed in both genotypes; thus they were independent of Arg1 function. Of the 78 genes of the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, 51 were at least partially dependent, and 24 were dependent on Arg1. There were 102 genes whose expression needed to be corrected to WT spaceflight adaptation levels in the ARG1 KO cells. There were 107 genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight transcriptomes between ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight and WT cells in spaceflight; 25 of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells and were part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight ARG1 KO cells alone (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B, Category I indicated with *), 82 of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells but were not a part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight.These observations suggest that adaptation of a cell line to spaceflight is highly dependent on its physiological state, which is in turn guided by its genotype. The two cell lines in this study arrived at a different gene expression profile on orbit and changed expression of a different set of genes to get to that profile. Therefore, it is likely that there is no single gene expression profile that defines the spaceflight-adapted state for Arabidopsis cells. Rather each cell type and genotype will have a largely unique-appearing change in gene expression profiles in adapting to spaceflight.4.4. Biological implications of the gene expression profiles The agriGO PAGE tool (http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/) was used to evaluate specifically enriched biological processes in each of the comparison sets (Fig. 7). In addition, the potential roles of individual genes comprising the differential expression groups of the landscape described above (Independent, Dependent, Required, Corrected, Compensated; Fig. 6) were examined in more detail. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab Functional category comparisons among the differentially regulated genes in the four transcriptome comparisons using Parametric Analysis of Gene Expression. Yellow-to-red and cyan-to-blue color scale in CM (color mode) indicate whether the representation of the genes encompassed in that term is up- or downregulated as a group. The Gene Groups comprising each analysis are provided in the first column. No (number) represents the number of genes included in each GO term. Ont refers to the Ontology group represented (P = biological process, F = molecular function, C = cellular component). The CM comparison categories are as follows: 1 is FWt : GWt, 2 is FArg : GArg, 3 is GArg : GWt, and 4 is FArg : FWt, and the numerical values supporting the color rendering are provided to the right of the CM columns. The blank rows represent the null results obtained from individual analyses of the two components of the Gene Group “78 + 102 = 180 Important to WT spaceflight adaptation” (78: Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent) and (102: Corrected). Individual comparisons did not display a coordinated pattern of expression according to ontological categories.The PAGE analysis revealed that although individual genes may differ in each expression set, those genes are largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting different paths can be taken to arrive at the same destination. For instance, processing all 180 Important (Fig. 6) genes in PAGE indicated some variety in the biological processes engaged in each spaceflight-to-ground, and genotype-to-genotype, comparison. If the gene sets comprising the subcategories on Important genes are processed (Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent, and Corrected; Fig. 6), there were no significant differences in the general biological processes used by the two genotypes to physiologically adapt to spaceflight (middle panels Fig. 7). In other words, depending on the initial resources available in a cell's metabolic “tool box,” slightly different routes of approach appear to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. A closer look at the genomic strategies used by WT and ARG1 KO cells to navigate diverse routes to a common goal revealed genes essential to spaceflight adaptation, including genes that would be masked if we were to have simply essayed WT response strategies alone. Although there was not always a common functionally binding them together, in many cases, genes comprising each category defined above were often aligned in strategic roles. 4.4.1. Independent genes The genes of this small category are tied together by potential roles in the detection and maintenance of cell polarity. The most highly induced of the Independent genes is a WRKY2 (At5g56270) transcription factor known to play a major role in the establishment of cell polarity by regulating apical/basal cell fate by activating WOX8 (Jeong et al., 2016). Cell polarity is also tied to auxin transport (Gao et al., 2008), and if the p value is relaxed to a value <0.05 (see Fig. 5B), two of the three additional genes that become included are associated with auxin/brassinosteroid signaling pathways: At1g78860, a curculin-like family protein, and At4g22500, an auxin-induced gene of unknown function (GEO GDS744) (Huang et al., 2013). Curculin-like genes have also been implicated in the regulatory network that establishes the adaxial/abaxial surfaces in Arabidopsis (Reinhart et al., 2013), which also connects to the regulatory pathways that guide polarity in plant cells.4.4.2. Dependent genes There were 75 genes that were at least somewhat dependent on a functional Arg1, many of which were transcription factors associated with the regulation of hormone signaling and cell proliferation. The two most highly induced genes were transcription factors bZIP16 and APD1. Factor bZIP16 primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes responsive to light, gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) (Hsieh et al., 2012), while RING-finger protein APD1 (ABERRANT POLLEN DEVELOPMENT1) is associated with pollen development and with signaling in the 9-Lipoxygenase pathway central to root development and pathogen defense (Qin et al., 2014; Walper et al., 2016). This latter role could connect it to another highly induced gene in this category: PSK4, which encodes a precursor to Phytosulfokine 4, one of a family of cell wall receptors that function in cell proliferation, expansion, and wound repair (Tameshige et al., 2015). Interestingly, PSK4 has been shown to promote callus growth in root explants and, further, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by subtilase SBT1, a gene which is also induced in spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (Chevalier et al., 2005). The gene SRF5 appears to be a member of the STRUBBELIG family of transmembrane receptor-like kinases that contribute to the regulation of cell morphogenesis and proliferation (Chevalier et al., 2005).4.4.3. Required genes Among the Dependent genes there were also 12 genes differentially expressed between WT and ARG1 KO cells on the ground, which were further subcategorized as Required (Fig. 5A Category III); many of the Required genes were associated with pathogen response. Among the highly induced were an uncharacterized lipase that has been associated with auxin signaling and pathogen response, a cytochrome450 (CYP71B2) that has shown downregulation in response to pathogens, and PEN2, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that is essential for defense against powdery mildew in barley (Schenk et al., 2003; Cabrera et al., 2014). Likewise with the three upregulated genes encoding proteases—one encoding a Subtilase family protein that has a role in processing a cell wall pectin methylesterase, another was a member of the cystatin/monellin superfamily of proteases, a group which plays a role in pathogen resistance, and finally a ubiquitin-like protease (Senechal et al., 2014; van Wyk et al., 2014). A gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism (neutral/alkaline non-lysosomal ceramidase) was also upregulated. Sphingolipids are a class of lipid signaling molecules that play a role in the apoptotic processes associated with plant pathogen defense, which also ties this Required gene to defense-related metabolism (Berkey et al., 2012). There was one downregulated gene in this group of genes: an uncharacterized Zinc knuckle (CCHC-type) family protein (At2g12880). A survey of GEO profiles reveals that At2g12880 is highly overexpressed in Arabidopsis mutants of subunit 4 (CSN4) of the COP9 signalosome responsible for the regulation of auxin response (Huang et al., 2013). The abundance of pathogen response and cell wall–related genes in this category suggests that Arg1 plays a role in cell wall remodeling even in the absence of other environmental stimuli, a role that is consistent with ARG1's function within the endomembrane delivery system.4.4.4. Corrected genes The 102 genes in the Corrected group (Fig. 4A, Categories II and III) represent a truly unique and fascinating category of genes—these are genes that, while required for spaceflight adaptation, would not have been revealed by a spaceflight-to-ground comparison in WT cells. About a tenth of the 102 genes corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO cells in the spaceflight transcriptome are associated with transport processes. Genes encoding proteins that play a role in the transport of amino acids (Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein), small molecules (MATE efflux family protein, RSH2 root hair specific 2), water (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein), sugar (SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F), metal ions (HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5), and protons (NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2) all had expression adjusted to levels comparable to the spaceflight transcriptome of WT cells. This is another instance where the association of ARG1 with intracellular vesicle trafficking (Boonsirichai et al., 2003) supports a role for ARG1 in spaceflight adaptation, as cells lacking Arg1 show impairment in the intracellular transport among cell compartments. Further, the abundance of the transporter genes brought to the WT expression levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome could suggest that the transmembrane transport processes may be affected by a reduced gravity environment and that a certain level of transporter gene expression is required to assure the efficient continuum of their performance. Genes associated with hormone-mediated signaling are also well represented among the genes that are corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome. Examples include WD domain, G-beta repeat protein gene, SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, and UNS2 Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases (NAT) These genes are associated primarily with plant growth, cell expansion and architecture, and morphogenesis (Lehman et al., 1996; Schwab et al., 2003; Saedler et al., 2009; Nomoto et al., 2012), suggesting that the cell growth may need to be adjusted in spaceflight and that a certain level expression of development-related genes may be required.4.4.5. Compensated genes There were 107 genes that appear to help compensate for the lack of Arg1 in cells (Fig. 4A Category IV; Fig. 4B). Together, these 107 genes define the genotype-specific strategy employed by cells lacking an active Arg1 gene to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment, and provide a link to the role of Arg1 in adapting to spaceflight (Fig. 6). Genes associated with cell-wall metabolism figure prominently in this category. For example, genes participating primarily in molecular grafting of xyloglucan chains such as At1g68560, alpha-xylosidase 1, and the two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, XTH9 (At4g03210) and XTH4 (At2g06850), were significantly downregulated in ARG1 KO in spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. This activity suggests that the process of splitting and/or reconnection of the xyloglucan cross-links in the cell wall occurred in the spaceflight in cells lacking Arg1 in a manner different from WT cells. Further, the repression of these cell-wall remodeling genes indicates that cell-wall loosening processes and cell expansion were diminished in spaceflight when Arg1 gene is absent. It is well documented that cell wall remodeling is a component of both spaceflight adaptation and as a response to hypergravity (Nedukha, 1997; Soga et al., 1999, 2002; Paul et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015). The synthesis and assembly of many cell wall components are dependent on the Golgi apparatus and transport vesicles to the plasma membrane. Genes involved in intracellular transport were also highly represented in those differentially expressed in spaceflight transcriptomes when Arg1 function was disabled. For instance, the genes associated with vesicle-mediated transport such as Prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 (At5g56230), SRP54 signal recognition particle (At5g49500) of the signal recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum, SOS1 sodium proton exchanger (At2g01980) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, and a Clathrin adaptor complex protein (At4g35410) were all differentially expressed in the spaceflight samples between ARG1 KO and WT cells. The endomembrane system, intracellular transport, and vesicle trafficking genes were also a large part of the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, although the individual representative genes differed from those engaged in the ARG1 KO cells. This finding reinforces the conclusion that these processes are sensitive to the reduced-gravity environment and that cells handle them differently depending on ARG1 availability. The importance of vesicle trafficking and intracellular transport has also been identified in ground studies that demonstrated mutants of a vacuolar membrane system genes exhibited agravitropic phenotypes (Kato et al., 2002; Surpin, 2014). In addition, ground studies have shown that chemical treatments that disrupt gravitropism cause aberrant endomembrane morphologies, particularly of vacuoles, which underscores the link between the endomembrane system and gravitropism in plants (Surpin et al., 2005). If indeed ARG1 executes its role in the adaptation to spaceflight microgravity through the endomembrane system, then the link of the endomembrane system to gravity sensing in the specialized cells of the plant root could be extended to include undifferentiated cells as well. Connecting ARG1 to gravity perception in undifferentiated cells would imply a universal, cell-type independent tool for gravity sensing in plants. Another group of genes in this category associate with gravitropism on the ground through auxin signaling and cell polarity. POL, a Protein phosphatase 2C family protein (At2g46920) and the GRAS family transcription factor SGR7 (SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 7-At4g37650) showed substantially diminished expression level in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. POL plays a role in establishing and maintaining the stem cell polarity and localization of auxin signaling (Gagne et al., 2008), and SRG7 is involved in radial organization of the root and shoot axial organs that are responsible for directing asymmetric cell division (Koizumi et al., 2012). The most prominent example of ARG1 engagement in establishing cell polarity occurs in root statocytes upon gravistimulation and is a basis for root gravitropism. In ground studies, ARG1 KO plants exhibit increased auxin accumulation in root tips, which then results in a strong defect in root gravitropism (Sedbrook et al., 1998). Although ARG1 protein is likely to play a role in enabling auxin redistribution in statocytes, ARG1's wide association with the endomembrane system and cytoskeleton suggests a more diverse role in gravity sensing in plants, which is actually well aligned with the concept that ARG1 might be important to undifferentiated cells. ARG1 might mediate gravity signal transduction in undifferentiated cells by promoting the folding, targeting, or degradation of gravitropic regulators in the vicinity of the cytoskeletal network. The observation that the genes related to the gravity sensing and signaling were compensated in the ARG1 KO cells suggests that alternative systems to the ARG1 exist and were required for successful spaceflight adaptation.4.5. BRIC-16 This experiment is the second time that Arabidopsis cell cultures were sent into space. The first cell culture experiment was launched to the ISS in 2010 on STS131 (BRIC-16) (Paul et al., 2012). These two BRIC cell culture experiments were substantially different in many aspects. First, the cells used in BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 were of different “ages” before launch, as defined by the amount of time grown on solid media after being transferred from liquid culture. The BRIC-16 cells spent an additional week on solid media compared to the BRIC-17 cells. Second, the BRIC-17 cultures were freshly established, while the BRIC-16 culture had been established as a culture line for years. When the new mutant (ARG1 KO) cell line was created, we simultaneously created the comparable WT line to minimize physiological differences in the two BRIC-17 lines. And finally, besides the differences in the biological material, there were differences in the experimental profile of BRIC-17 as compared to BRIC-16: the space vehicle used to launch to the ISS, the mission profile, and the days spent in microgravity (Table S9). The spaceflight transcriptomes of the WT cells of BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 CEL had only one differentially expressed gene in common (At5g62710, a protein kinase). However, the general patterns of gene expression in both experiments suggest they held many of the same strategies of physiological adaptation in common. In BRIC-16, although the largest category of genes induced were heat-shock genes, among the next most highly differentially expressed genes were those associated with pathogen response, wounding, and cell wall remodeling; a pattern that is closely aligned with the current study (Paul et al., 2012). The WT cells used in both experiments were of identical genotype; thus the most likely explanation for the paucity of coordinately expressed genes between the two spaceflight experiments is that each cell line began their respective flights with a ground transcriptome profile that reflected environmental and developmental parameters unique to each experiment. The BRIC-16 cells may have already engaged a series of adaptive strategies that were not necessary in the WT cells of BRIC-17; it is likely that the abundance of heat-shock and stress-response genes in the BRIC-16 spaceflight transcriptome pattern was related to a more stressful ground state before launch. Thus, the age and “stress level” of the cell lines before launch make a substantial difference in how the cells respond to the spaceflight environment. However, the very fact that they are different has provided valuable insight into the response that these cells—any cells—have to the novel environment of space. And yet, on this background, these cells also expressed and repressed the genes necessary to engage in cell-wall remodeling processes that now seem to be a hallmark of spaceflight physiological adaptation.5. Conclusions The results presented here suggest that there is more to understanding spaceflight adaptation than identifying genes that are changed in expression as WT cells adjust to spaceflight. There are also genes whose activity at certain levels is required for spaceflight adaptation but whose expression levels need not be changed from that which occurs on the ground. Those important but nonchanging genes are revealed by comparing expression patterns between WT and mutant lines. In a very real sense, limiting the list of genes required for spaceflight adaptation to those that need to be changed only in WT cells can restrict insight into the full scope of the spaceflight physiological adaptation process. The Arg1 gene appears to have a major role in spaceflight adaptation of cultured cells, perhaps through gravity sensing, in these nonspecialized, undifferentiated cells. The major ARG1 role seems to relate to its association with the endomembrane system, mediation of the proper localization/targeting or activity of proteins at the plasma membrane or at organelles of the secretory pathway. These data imply that Arg1 also has a function in spaceflight adaptation in differentiated cells within intact plants. Moreover, these data suggest that the genotype, and therefore the physiological state of a cell, can have a dramatic effect on the expression profile of genes needed for spaceflight adaptation. These data also further reinforce the conclusions drawn from a growing body of plant spaceflight literature that suggest that at least one underlying theme of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment is cell-wall remodeling.Supplementary Material Supplemental data Supp_Figure1.pdf (45.9KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S1.pdf (227.8KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S2.pdf (258.8KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S3.pdf (233.4KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S4.pdf (243.7KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S5.pdf (276.6KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S6.pdf (319.2KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S7.pdf (295KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S8.pdf (140.1KB, pdf) Supplemental data Supp_Figure2.pdf (44.2KB, pdf) Supplemental data Table_S9.pdf (288.8KB, pdf) Abbreviations Used Arg1 Altered response to gravity 1 ARG1 KO ARG1 knock-out BRIC Biological Research In Canisters CEL Cellular Expression Logic Col-0 Columbia-0 GEO Gene Expression Omnibus GO Gene Ontology ISS International Space Station KSC Kennedy Space Center PAGE Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment PDFUs Petri Dish Fixation Units RT-qPCR real quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TAIR The Arabidopsis Information Resource WT wild type Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants NNX12AK80G and NNX12AN69G to R.J.

That community includes the reviewers of this manuscript, who helped the authors clarify complex issues of presentation and interpretation. In particular the authors appreciate the need and desire of the community (and this paper) to remain diligent in the description of experimental results as comparing spaceflight samples to ground control samples. Isolating the effects of microgravity from the general and combined effects of spaceflight would require the utilization of high-quality long-arm centrifuges on orbit. Therefore, the authors strive to specifically use the terms “spaceflight” and “ground” as the terms for the major experimental contrasts in this study.Author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist.References Abas L., Benjamins R., Malenica N., Paciorek T., Wisniewska J., Moulinier-Anzola J.C., Sieberer T., Friml J., and Luschnig C.

    "abstract": "Abstract A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.

    "introduction": "Introduction The complex networks and signalling pathways that equip plants to cope with environmental challenge developed over evolutionary time in terrestrial environments. Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs (Cowles et al. 1984; Hoson et al. 2002; Soga et al. 2002; Paul et al. 2013a; Ferl et al. 2014). Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response (Paul et al. 2017), thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments. The physiological impact of spaceflight is reflected in the patterns of gene expression. Irrespective of plant growth hardware, duration in space or age of plants, one consensus is that spaceflight elicits responses from pathways associated with cell wall remodelling, cell polarity, phytohormone-mediated processes, as well as general stress responses, such as wounding, pathogen defence, heat shock and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Joo et al. 2001; Paul et al. 2005, 2012b, 2013a; Correll et al. 2013; Zupanska et al. 2013; Ferl et al. 2014; Mazars et al. 2014; Sugimoto et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Kwon et al. 2015; Schüler et al. 2015). In addition, a large proportion of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight encode unknown proteins. Spaceflight-grown Arabidopsis roots tend to be smaller, have fewer lateral roots and shorter root hair development than their terrestrial controls (Paul et al. 2012a; Kwon et al. 2015). Aspects of these morphologies in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) suggest a relationship between the down-regulation of several peroxidase genes in spaceflight (Kwon et al. 2015). In this study, a spaceflight-induced gene of unknown function identified from roots was investigated for its potential involvement in ROS-related functions. AT1G05290, which we have dubbed Orbitally Manifested Gene 1 (OMG1), was one of the highest significantly (P = 0.0005) induced genes in the Advanced Plant Experiment 01 (APEX01) spaceflight data set (fold change = 12) (Paul et al. 2013a). Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks around OMG1 show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathways Obayashi et al. 2014. OMG1 was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes (Shin and Schachtman 2004; Potocký et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2007; Lassig et al. 2014). In addition, OMG1 is an unrealized member of the CONSTANS-Like family of transcription factors. These findings, originating with the novel environment of spaceflight, further the understanding of plant growth and development and provide insight into the role of a heretofore unknown gene.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods ROSMETER analysis The ROSMETER tool assesses the ROS-related transcriptomic signature in a large-scale Arabidopsis gene expression data set (Rosenwasser et al. 2013). Arabidopsis gene expression profiles from two independent spaceflight experiments, APEX01 and Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2), along with their corresponding ground controls, were used to correlate differential gene expression in spaceflight with specific ROS species and origins. The APEX01 experiment utilized two ecotypes and both were planted on each plate of the experiment. Since the entire plate was harvested on orbit to a single tube, the subsequent transcriptomic analyses comprised 60 % Wassilewskija (WS) and 40 % Col-0 (Paul et al. 2013b). In the APEX03-2 data set, WS and Col-0 were kept on separate plates, harvested into separate tubes and analysed individually. A data set from Col-0 compared to WS vertically grown in standard laboratory conditions was included as an additional control (Schultz et al. 2017). From each data set, Affymetrix Probeset-ID, Gene Locus ID, P-value and fold change were listed and submitted to ROSMETER. The heatmap was constructed using the GENE-E software with hierarchical clustering using the Matrix value offered in the software. Plant materials and growth conditions Seeds from both Col-0 and WS were prepared for APEX01 and APEX03-2 as previously described (Paul et al. 2012b, 2013b; Sng et al. 2014; Ferl and Paul 2016). Briefly, plants were cultured on Phytagel™ 10 cm Petri plates and grown either in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware (APEX01), or in the Veggie hardware (APEX03-2) under continuous lighting of ~80–135 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR. In this study, the effects of the spaceflight environment were evaluated, which includes ambient radiation, microgravity and attending effects on convection. In both experiments, the ground control plants were grown with a 24- to 48-h schedule delay that allowed the comparable ground growth chambers to be programmed with the precise environmental conditions that the International Space Station (ISS)-grown plants received on orbit. Plants grown for additional laboratory analyses were grown on Phytagel™ 10 cm plates or in soil, and placed in a greenhouse growth chamber on a 24-h light cycle (~80 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR) at 22 °C. OMG1 promoter::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants and analyses A 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region upstream of the OMG1 (AT1G05290) initial Met was amplified from Arabidopsis gDNA using primer pair A [seeSupporting Information—Table S1], which contains restriction enzyme sites BamHI in the forward primer and NcoI in the reverse. The sequenced and confirmed BamHI/NcoI fragment containing the OMG1 5′ flanking region was cloned into pCAMBIA1303 to create the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 fusion construct. Although this region may not represent the full complement of motifs that regulate OMG1, the 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region does serve to promote OMG1 transcription and will be referred to as the basal promoter. The construct was then transformed into Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) strain GV3101 for floral dip transformation into WS plants (Clough and Bent 1998). Ten independent OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic lines grown on selection media (250 mg L−1 Carbenecillin and 50 mg L−1 Hygromycin) were screened for T3 homozygosity. Plants grown on Phytagel plates were used for histochemical localization of β-glucuronidase (GUS) (Jefferson et al. 1987). Pollen and pollen tube analyses were performed as described (Li et al. 1999). T1 heterozygous populations of pollen grains and tubes were incubated with X-Gluc to reveal the specificity of the histochemical localization in transformed pollen. Basal OMG1 promoter activity in plants requires ~3 h of staining before detection of GUS in the various locations, whereas GUS activity induced by wounding was observed within 30 min of staining. In the GUS qRT-PCR wounding experiments with OMG1p::GUSmgfp5, comparable leaves from three individual plants were crimped with forceps and left intact on the plant for the duration of each time point (30 min, 1, 4 and 16 h). Leaves were harvested to liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. In the mock and immediate time point, leaves were either unwounded or crimped and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA transcribed from total RNA was used to analyse the transcript abundance of GUSA. Primer pairs B and C [seeSupporting Information—Table S1] were used for the analyses. GUSA transcript abundance was normalized to UBQ11 (AT4G05050). Gene expression analyses of OMG1 and other downstream genes OMG1 RT-qPCR analyses used TaqMan™ (Applied Biosystems) on spaceflight material from APEX01 and APEX03-2. OMG1 gene expression was normalized to UBQ11 primer and probe sequences D and E [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. The omg1 knockout (KO) line (SALK_045742C) was validated for a homozygous T-DNA insertion using primers F. Homozygous lines were selfed until all progeny were homozygous and screened for the absence of full-length OMG1 transcript [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S1]. RT-qPCR analyses of OMG1 expression induced by a time course wounding assay were performed on wild-type (WT) Col-0, WS and omg1 lines. Three individual plants with leaves of similar ages and sizes were wounded by crushing between two glass slides. The wounded leaves were left attached to the plant for the allotted times (mock, immediate, 5, 10, 30 min and 1 h) before being harvested into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RT-qPCR analysis was conducted using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) along with the primer pairs C, D (without probe), G–H and L–R [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Fluorescent biochemical ROS assays For the ROS accumulation assay, intact leaves from WT Col-0, omg1 KO and rbohd KO (SALK_070610) were wounded with a 10 µL pipette tip and immediately immersed into the fluorescent probe 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichloro dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Sigma) solution as described in (Beneloujaephajri et al. 2013). Briefly, wounded and unwounded leaves were vacuum infiltrated in the dark for 20 min in 60 µM of DCF-DA in standard buffer. Leaves were then rinsed in standard buffer and observed under GFP bandpass filters using the Olympus BX51 compound light microscope at 10× magnification with 55 ms exposure time. Quantification of fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software was previously described (Jakic et al. 2017). A luminol-based ROS assay was done by measuring hydrogen peroxide produced by leaf discs when exposed to flg22. Discs (0.125 cm2) of 6-week-old WT Col-0, omg1 and rbohd plants were incubated in 100 µL ddH2O overnight in 96-well luminometer plates. Water was replaced with the reaction solution of 40 µM luminol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 µg mL−1 horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 50 nM of flg22 or water for the mock controls. ROS measurements expressed as means of RLU (relative light units) were taken at 2-min intervals for a period of 38 min. Phylogenetic analysis Protein sequences were identified by rpsblast search of the NR database (Marchler-Bauer and Bryant 2004; Marchler-Bauer et al. 2015;  Resource Coordinators 2016); full-length protein sequences containing a single CCT domain (pfam06203) with e-value < 0.01 were considered potential OMG1 homologs. Protein sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega v1.2.3 (Sievers et al. 2011), PROBALIGN (Roshan and Livesay 2006), MUSCLE v3.8.31 (Edgar 2004), MSAProbs v0.97 (Liu et al. 2010), PROBCONS (Do et al. 2005) and mafft-einsi v7.215 (Katoh and Standley 2013), with default parameters. Alignments were left unprocessed or processed by Gblocks v0.91 to remove potentially ambiguous regions (Talavera and Castresana 2007). The minimum number of sequences for a flank position (-b2) was 3/5 the total number of sequences. The maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions (-b3) was 10. The minimum block length (-b4) was 5, and gap positions were allowed (-b5 = a). Other Gblocks parameters were left at default values. Initial maximum likelihood phylogenies were constructed from each alignment using FastTree v2.1.7 with default parameters (Price et al. 2010). Initial trees were used as starting trees for full maximum likelihood reconstruction using RAxML v8.2.8 (Stamatakis 2014). Maximum likelihood phylogenies produced from each alignment were converted to a clade presence-absence matrix using the Super Tree Toolkit v0.1.2 (Hill and Davis 2014), and a supertree was inferred from this matrix using the BINCAT model in RAxML (Nguyen et al. 2012). Additionally, all individual sequence alignments were concatenated into a single supermatrix, which was used to infer the maximum likelihood protein family phylogeny using RAxML, with the best-fit evolutionary model selected by AIC (Wheeler et al. 1995). A consensus of ‘supertree’ and ‘supermatrix’ results was plotted using FigTree v1.4.3. Protein structural modelling of the B-box2 domain was done using both the Phyre2 and Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004). The closest OMG1 homolog, c2junA of the human Midline-1 (MID1) with a 92 % confidence level was used to predict the overall folding of the B-box domains in OMG1. The predicted structural model of OMG1 was compared to the x-ray crystal structure of c2junA using Chimera and MatchMaker. Side chains positioned near the zinc ions were displayed to predict the potential of OMG1 binding to zinc ions. 35S promoter:OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion construct for subcellular localization The coding sequence of OMG1 (RefSeq ID:NP_172021.2) was amplified from cDNA using primer pair I [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. The PCR fragment was sequenced before being cloned into the pCAMBIA1303 along with sGFP(S65T) (Chiu et al. 1996) gene via SpeI and BstEII restriction sites using primer pairs J [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Primer pair K was then used to amplify the entire OMG1cds-sGFP(S65T), which was validated by sequencing and cloned into pCAMBIA1302 vector via NcoI and BstEII restriction sites. For subcellular localization, Agrobacterium-GV3101 containing 100 µM acetosyringone, 0.05 % Silwet-77 and the pCAMBIA1302 vector or pCAMBIA1302-OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion vector were incubated in the dark for 20 min at 28 °C. Leaves of 4-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) seedlings were injected and GFP signal was observed after 2 days at 25 °C in the dark. DAPI was used to indicate the nucleus.",
    "results": "Results ROS-producing genes are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight in an ecotype-specific manner The differential gene expression data sets of the three independent spaceflight experiments and their comparable ground controls were used in the ROSMETER analyses. The heatmap shows the positive-(red), negative-(blue) and no correlation-(black) between the ROS indices and the queried spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1A). A general positive correlation of ROS-producing genes was observed in all the spaceflight transcriptomes and hierarchical clustering displayed a higher similarity with the APEX03-2_WS data set compared to the APEX03-2_Col-0 data set. Two interesting ROS correlation groups were observed in the heatmap. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2 ROS indices, whereas in the Col-0 background cytosolic ROS shows no correlation. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. Specifically, TDNA-AOX-MLD and Retenone-3h indices showed that if one ecotype had a positive correlation the other had no correlation. In addition, in the Retenone-12h and TDNA-AOX indices, the mixed ecotype transcriptome shows a similar trend to one of the two ecotypes. The control data set, which reflects terrestrial ecotype differences between Col-0 and WS, showed that many of the genes differentially expressed between the two ecotypes are associated with the ROS-scavenging mechanism. A representative transcriptome heatmap from the APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment that compared several significantly (P < 0.01) differentially expressed (>1 or −1 < log2 fold change) peroxidase genes between 4-day-old Col-0 and WS ecotypes illustrated that Col-0 alters the expression of many more peroxidase genes in spaceflight than does WS (Fig. 1B). Peroxidases, an integral part of ROS signalling in cell wall remodelling, cell elongation, auxin catabolism, and response to abiotic and biotic stress, (Shigeto and Tsutsumi 2016) were found to be differentially expressed in spaceflight. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Correlations between spaceflight transcriptome and ROS-related microarrays revealed that ROS is induced in spaceflight in an ecotype-dependent manner. (A) The microarray (APEX01) and the RNAseq (APEX03-2) analyses of spaceflight transcriptional profile relative to the ground control profile were correlated to known ROS-related data sets producing specific ROS species from specific locations within the cell using the bioinformatics tool called ROSMETER (Rosenwasser et al. 2013). Positive correlations (red) show ROS production, whereas negative correlations (blue) show ROS scavenging. Black cells suggest no correlations, whereas gray cells indicate that there are insufficient gene numbers for a statistical correlation. Clusters highlighted in yellow boxes denote regions of interest. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2 ROS indices. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. (B) Peroxidase genes having statically (P < 0.01) differential expression (>1 or −1 < log2 fold) between spaceflight and ground control in both WS and Col-0 ecotypes are depicted. Blue is indicative of down-regulation, red is indicative of up-regulation and gray indicates no statistically significant differential expression. OMG1 transcript is up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments OMG1 expression was up-regulated in WS roots across multiple spaceflight experiments (APEX01-1B, APEX01-2B and APEX03-2) but remained unchanged in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The Box-Whisker plot of Fig. 2 illustrates the median fold change of OMG1 expression between spaceflight and the ground control from a total of nine replicates from each sample. Each spaceflight experiment represents a distinct launch and orbital plant growth event. In both the APEX01 experiments, seeds germinated on orbit grew for 12 days before being harvested. OMG1 expression shows a 4-fold change in spaceflight compared to ground controls in APEX01-2B and 3.5-fold change in APEX01-1B. In both analyses, the large spread between the maximum and the minimum can be attributed to the mixture of ecotypes. In a subsequent spaceflight experiment, APEX03-2, plants grew for 8 or 11 days on the ISS before being harvested. In the APEX03-2 8-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 (no change), whereas WS showed a 3.9-fold increase in spaceflight. In the APEX03-2 11-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 and WS showed a 2.1-fold increase in expression. Figure 2. Open in a new tab OMG1 transcripts are up-regulated in WS but unchanged in Col-0 consistently over multiple spaceflight experiments. Ecotypes WS or Col-0 were grown onboard the ISS for the number of days (d) indicated, harvested and compared to comparable ground controls. OMG1 transcripts for flight and ground control samples assayed with qRT-PCR. Spaceflight experiment APEX01-2B launched to the ISS via STS131 and analyses published in Paul et al. (2013b). The same RNA used in the 12d APEX01 microarrays was used for qRT-PCR shown here. Spaceflight experiment APEX01-1B launched to the ISS via STS129, and spaceflight experiment APEX03-2, 8 day and 11 day was launched to the ISS via SpaceX05. Boxplots were constructed from nine replicates for each sample. Expressions were normalized to UBQ11 and plotted spaceflight relative to ground control using results generated from TaqMan™ qRT-PCR. Spaceflight experiments show that OMG1 transcript is up-regulated in spaceflight relative to ground controls in WS plants, whereas in Col-0 it remains largely unchanged. Significance *(P < 0.01), ** (P < 0.001) between samples is calculated by doing a single-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction. The OMG1 basal promoter activity was observed in roots, pollen tubes and upon wounding Histochemical GUS staining revealed some basal OMG1 promoter activity in roots and pollen but showed heighten activity upon wounding in the roots and leaves. T3 homozygous OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants were used to characterize the activity of the OMG1 promoter. In roots, basal OMG1 promoter activity was observed at low levels in the maturation zone of both the primary and lateral roots and root hairs (Fig. 3A, i–iv). In addition, basal promoter activity was also observed in pollen grains and pollen tubes (Fig. 3A, v–vii). A T1 heterozygous population of pollen grains grown in pollen germinating media (Fig. 3A, vii) was used to visualize the specificity of the GUS enzymatic reactions in transformed pollen. Serendipitously, wounded plant tissues were observed to have heightened OMG1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Figure 3. Open in a new tab A transgenic reporter line OMG1 promoter::GusGFP in the WS ecotype background shows OMG1 5′ flanking region activity. (A) Transgenic Arabidopsis plants of various ages underwent histochemical GUS staining with X-Gluc. The images show representative distribution patterns of GUS staining in (i) maturation zone of roots, (ii–iii) lateral roots, (iv) root hairs of the maturation zone, (v–vii) pollen and pollen tubes. Scale bars: (i–ii) 1 mm; (iii–vii) 100 µm. (B) OMG1 5′ flanking region activity was also observed upon wounding with a pair of forceps. Wild-type (WT) Col-0, Adh promoter::Gus transgenic line were used as a control to ensure GUS enzymatic activity was specific for OMG1 5′ flanking region. Both leaf (i–iii) and root tissue (iv–vi) from the various lines were used. Scale bars: 100 µm. (C) Intact leaf tissues were wounded and left for the allotted times before they were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis. The GUS transcript abundance fold change relative to mock was done to access the rapid wounding response of OMG1 5′ flanking region. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) of triplicate representative experiments. * indicate significant (P < 0.05) difference between immediate and the various wounding time points by doing a single-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction.To ensure that OMG1 promoter activity was specific to wounding, leaf and root tissues from WT Col-0, ADHp::GUS (Chung and Ferl 1999) and OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 lines were wounded with a pair of forceps. In this wounding experiment, GUS staining was observed only in the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 line. A qRT-PCR analysis of GUSA transcripts from leaves wounded at different time points showed that OMG1 promoter activity heightens immediately after wounding and dissipates after 30 min (Fig. 3C). OMG1 regulates the expression of MYB77 and GRX480 known to be induced in spaceflight and upon wounding Eight genes [seeSupporting Information—Table S2] were used to elucidate potential functional interactions with OMG1. Since OMG1 promoter activity was shown to rise immediately after wounding (Fig. 3C), a wounding time course of mock, immediate, 10 min and 1 h was used to screen the expression of the genes listed in Supporting Information—Table S2 that could be affected by knocking out OMG1. Two genes, GRX480 (At1g28480) and MYB77 (At3g50060), out of eight genes tested showed significant differences (Student’s t-test P < 0.05) in gene expression between WT and omg1 lines (Fig. 4D and F). The expression of GRX480 was repressed after wounding in the omg1 line and did not increase as did the WT line. On the other hand, MYB77 expressed in the omg1 line showed a significant delay in down-regulating gene expression when compared to the WT at the 10-min post-wounding time point. MYB77 and GRX480 were significantly differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 5). Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1.7 and WS showed a 3-fold increase in MYB77 expression in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5A). In the GRX480 analyses, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 0.3 and WS showed a median fold change of 1.3 in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab OMG1 regulates the rapid wounding response of MYB77 and GRX480. WT Col-0 and omg1 KO intact leaf tissues were untouched (mock) or wounded with a pair of forceps and left for the indicated time points before harvesting for qRT-PCR analyses. Expression of the indicated genes (A–H) shared between spaceflight, rapid wounding and pollen development [seeSupporting Information—Table S2] in the WT (Col-0) and omg1 KO leaves was analysed. Untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding were the indicated time points that the transcripts were measured. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. * indicate significance (P < 0.05), ** (P < 0.001) between WT Col-0 and omg1 which was calculated by doing a two-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments.Figure 5. Open in a new tab MYB77 and GRX480 expression of APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment showed higher fold change in WS compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (A) qRT-PCR done on APEX03-2 11d spaceflight root tissue show that MYB77 transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls is significantly (P = 0.001) different between WS and Col-0 plants. The fold change of MYB77 expression is higher in the WS ecotype compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (B) qRT-PCR showed a significant (P = 0.007) difference in the expression fold change of GRX480 between Col-0 and WS plants. Boxplots were derived from nine replicates normalized to UBQ11 and plotted spaceflight relative to ground control. ** indicate (P < 0.01) significant difference between Col-0 and WS was calculated by doing a Student’s t-test. ROS accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered in omg1 KO leaves compared to Col-0 leaves Wild-type Col-0, omg1 and respiratory burst oxidase homology D (rbohd) KO plants, which are delayed in ROS accumulation (Miller et al. 2009), were subjected to mechanical wounding with a pipette tip. The production of hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cells was measured with DCF-DA assay. Green fluorescence at the site of wounding was captured after 20 min with light microscopy. Wild-type Col-0 leaves produced ROS around the wound site, whereas neither omg1 nor rbohd showed prominent production of ROS (Fig. 6A). Quantification of fluorescence using ImageJ showed significant differences (Student’s t-test P < 0.01) between Col-0 and the mutant lines (Fig. 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered in omg1 leaves compared to Col-0 leaves. (A and B) DCF-DA ROS assay performed on wounded leaf tissues reveals that OMG1 affects cellular ROS production. (A) DCF-DA is a fluorogenic dye that measures hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cell. A pipette tip was used to wound the surface of the leaves from the WT line, omg1 KO line and rbohd KO line (a known ROS-deficient mutant). Upon wounding, ROS is usually produced around the site of injury. The DCF-DA reagent is then oxidized by ROS resulting in appearance of green fluorescence. Plants were wounded and immediately placed in the DCF-DA solution for 20 min before visualized on the light microscope. (i) WT Col-0 leaves without wounding, (ii) WT Col-0 leaves, (iii) omg1 leaves and (iv) rbohd leaves were placed in DCF-DA solution immediately after wounding. In the WT plants green fluorescence around the wound site indicates the production of ROS. However, in the omg1 KO line and the rbohd KO line, ROS production was not detected. Images were taken on the Olympus BX51 compound scope at 10× magnification, exposure time 55 ms. Scale bars: 100 µm. (B) Quantification of fluorescence was performed using integrated density (IntDen) and corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) [CTCF = Integrated density − (Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings)] in ImageJ. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test, bar graphs with different letters show significant difference (P < 0.01). (C and D) Higher elicitor-induced oxidative burst in omg1 KO is not associated with altered expression of RbohD. (C) Extracellular ROS production was measured using a luminol-based assay in leaf discs from omg1 KO, rbohd KO and WT Col-0 plants after elicitation with water or flg22. Experiments were repeated at least three times and results are a mean of 24 samples. (D) The relative expression of RbohD in the WT (Col-0) and omg1 KO leaves was analysed in a wounding assay untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. No significant difference in RbohD expression between Col-0 and omg1 KO plants was observed when the Student’s t-test analysis was performed. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments.Based on luminol ROS assays OMG1 affects the elicitor-induced generation of extracellular ROS. Flg22-induced hydrogen peroxide production by leaf discs of omg1 mutants was ~20 % higher compared to Col-0. Water-treated controls along with the rbohd leaf discs showed no production of flg22-induced H2O2 (Fig. 6C). Since elicitor-induced extracellular ROS is governed by RbohD, the measurement of RbohD expression between Col-0 and omg1 lines in a wounding time course was analysed (Fig. 6D). The relative expression of RbohD showed no significant difference between WT and omg1 leaves. OMG1 is a member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family The predicted OMG1 gene encodes a 369 amino acid protein that contains a C-terminal 43 amino acid sequence that is 84 % sequence similarity to the (CONSTANS (CO), CONSTANS-Like (COL) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1)) ‘CCT’ domain (Berardini et al. 2015). OMG1 also contains two divergent B-box domains in the N-terminal region [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S2]. The OMG1 B-box1 domain has 51 % similarity to the B-box1 consensus sequence, and the OMG1 B-box2 domain has a 94 % similarity to the B-box2 consensus sequence (Griffiths et al. 2003; Masaki et al. 2005; Gangappa and Botto 2014). A consensus phylogeny suggests that OMG1 belongs to group II of the CO and COL family of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 6). Maximum likelihood phylogenies placed a clade of OMG1-related sequences from Brassicas and Monocots (SH-like aLRT > 0.989) close to COL11-12 sequences from across flowering plants [seeSupporting Information—Table S3]. OMG1 appears closely related to the COL11-12 and COL9-10 lineages, although the precise placement of the OMG1 group remains unresolved. Both the OMG1 and the COL11-12 clades consist of sequences representing both monocots and dicots. In the consensus tree, a single COL11-12-like sequence from the basal flowering plant Amborella trichopoda rooted the OMG1 and COL11-12 clades (SH-like aLRT > 0.912), suggesting that the OMG1 lineage arose via a gene-duplication event in flowering plants, prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots (Fig. 7). However, no OMG1-related sequences from Eudicots were observed outside the Brassicaceae family, suggesting that either OMG1 was lost from non-Brassica dicots, or the sequence has diverged so much in these lineages as to be unrecognizable. The different alignment and tree-reconstruction procedures support the early-duplication hypothesis, and make it unlikely that the grouping of monocot and dicot OMG1-related sequences is a phylogenetic artefact. Figure 7. Open in a new tab OMG1 is a member of the CO and COL protein family in Arabidopsis. The consensus tree derived from full-length protein sequences containing a single CCT domain of all plants found in the non-redundant (NR) database revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CO and COL family of proteins. In Arabidopsis (taxa highlighted in cyan), the COL family can be divided into three groups. Group I (shaded in light blue) comprises of CO, COL1-6 which have domain structures consisting of two B-box domains (type I and type II) at the N-terminal and both a VP motif along with a CCT domain at the C-terminal. Genes in group II (shaded in light purple) comprising of COL9-15 and OMG1 have domain structure consisting of a type I B-box domain and a second diverged B-box2 domain along with a C-terminal CCT domain. The OMG1 clade is highlighted in red, whereas its closest homolog COL11-12 is highlighted in green. Group III (shaded in light orange) comprises of COL6-8 and COL16 have domain structures consisting of a single B-box1 domain and a CCT domain. Listed in the grey boxes are the characterized functions of some of the COL members (Gangappa and Botto 2014).The high level of sequence divergence in the OMG1 B-box1 domain is primarily due to a 13-amino acid deletion close to the start of the B-box1 consensus sequence CX-------------XAXLCX2CDX3H (Fig. 7). This B-box1 deletion was observed across several Brassica sequences nested within the OMG1 clade, but this deletion was not found in monocot OMG1, suggesting it probably occurred late in the Brassicaceae lineage. Although the OMG1 B-box2 domain is largely conserved (Fig. 8), two highly conserved consensus amino acids are different in OMG1 compared to the consensus sequence CX2CX7-10CX7CX2CX5-12H. The third cysteine in the consensus sequence is serine in OMG1 (C49S), and the histidine at the end of the consensus sequence is leucine (H73L). Examination of B-box2 domains outside the OMG1 clade suggests that these substitutions are unique to the OMG1 clade [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3]. Figure 8. Open in a new tab OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11 and 12 and underwent a subsequent B-box1 deletion event. OMG1 and CONSTANS-Like (COL) 11-12 are sister clades based on the consensus tree described in Fig. 8, suggesting that OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11-12 (indicated by the circle). Sequences within the OMG1 clade are grouped into Brassicas and monocots. The Brassica sequences highlighted in red, share a similar B-box1 deletion indicated by the triangle and reflected in the adjacent B-box1 domain sequences derived using the AliView software. The B-box1 consensus sequence (Gangappa and Botto 2014) is listed and regions where the deletion occurs are highlighted in blue. The consensus tree depicted here is not drawn to scale.The B-box domain family belongs to a subgroup of zinc-binding proteins stabilized by canonical cysteine-rich zinc-finger motifs (Klug and Schwabe 1995). The inferred structure of Zn-bound OMG1 B-box2 suggests that OMG1 is capable of stably binding at least one zinc ion, via a canonical zinc-finger motif (Fig. 9). In the model, four conserved cysteine residues surrounding the CX2C configuration were spatially positioned in a similar fashion as the amino acids surrounding the first Zn-binding site in the human MID1 template, suggesting this first OMG1 Zn-binding site retains a canonical zinc-finger structure. Figure 9. Open in a new tab The B-box2 domain of OMG1 is predicted to bind at least one zinc ion. The sequence of B-box2 domain was compared between Arabidopsis COL11-12, OMG1 and the basal species Amborella trichopoda. The consensus sequence of the B-box2 domain is listed and OMG1 seems to have a relatively conserved B-box2 domain except for the residues highlighted in blue. Residues within the COL sequences that create a zinc-binding interface are indicated by the black lines, whereas residues that might create a second zinc-binding interface are indicated by the blue lines. The human MID1 sequence is also listed and residues that bind to the first zinc ion are highlighted in pink, whereas residues that bind to the second zinc ion are highlighted in blue. OMG1 B-box2 domain was modelled after a well-characterized B-box2 found in the Human MID1 protein located in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Modelling of the protein was done using the Chimera protein modelling software. In the Arabidopsis OMG1 protein, four cysteines are positioned such that they interact with a zinc ion. However, the substitution of amino acids around the second zinc-binding region shows strong evidence for the loss of the second Zn-binding site as modelled in the human MID1 template.However, radical substitutions at key Zn-binding sites (C49S, E52Q, C67I and H73L) occurring in the second Zn-binding pocket of OMG1’s B-box2 motif appear to completely disrupt potential Zn-binding (Fig. 9). It remains unclear whether the series of indels and substitutions after the OMG1 B-box2 domain could result in a novel structure that facilitates zinc ion binding or a different functional motif. Furthermore, sequences within the OMG1 clade show similar substitutions at most of these conserved Zn-binding residues, implicating the possibility that functional B-box2 in these proteins require only a single Zn ion [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3]. OMG1 localizes to the nucleus The transient expression of a 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion protein in tobacco leaves indicates that OMG1 localizes in the nucleus. The highly conserved CCT domain in OMG1 has been associated with important functions in transcriptional regulation, DNA binding and nuclear localization (Robson et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2011; Gendron et al. 2012). Cells transformed with 35S::eGFP alone displayed a uniform expression of eGFP throughout the leaf pavement cells in the vacuoles, nucleus and membrane. However, cells transformed with 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion were specifically localized to the nucleus, as indicated by the DAPI nuclei-specific counter stain (Fig. 10). Figure 10. Open in a new tab OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain and localizes in the nucleus. (A) The sequence of CCT domain was compared between Arabidopsis COL11-12, OMG1 and the basal species Amborella trichopoda. OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain (consensus sequence in black) that encodes a nuclear localization signal (highlighted in red). (B) Subcellular localization using leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings that were transiently transformed with Agrobacterium-GV3101 carrying the At1g05290cds-eGFP fusion vector or the pCAMBIA1302 (as an overexpressing eGFP control) indicated that OMG1 is localized solely in the nucleus and exhibits no presence elsewhere in the cell. DAPI stains for the nucleus and can be seen to overlap with the eGFP expression. Scale bars: 100 µm.",
    "discussion": "Discussion As sessile organisms, plants have developed sensitive, adaptive strategies to regulate their metabolism in a changing environment (Noctor et al. 2007; Schwarzländer and Finkemeier 2012). A strategy to avoid oxidative damage relies on the ability to deploy different antioxidants and ROS-scavenging/detoxifying enzymes to efficiently adjust their redox states. When subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight, plants respond by overexpressing more ROS- or redox-associated genes than comparable plants on the ground (Im et al. 2011; Paul et al. 2012b, 2013b, 2017; Correll et al. 2013; Sugimoto et al. 2014). ROS in its various forms and subcellular production sites can elicit distinct and diverse physiological, biochemical and molecular responses (Mittler et al. 2004; Gadjev et al. 2006; Swanson and Gilroy 2010; Suzuki et al. 2012). It is possible that plants drew from diverse ROS response strategies to cope with spaceflight, an environment that is outside their evolutionary experience and therefore potentially stressful. The data presented here suggest that OMG1 is a putative regulator of the ROS signalling pathway associated with wounding and may play a prominent role in regulating the spaceflight ROS response, especially in the WS ecotype where it is strongly induced by spaceflight. Spaceflight induces the differential expression of ROS-producing genes in an ecotype-dependent manner In general, the differentially expressed genes in spaceflight showed a positive correlation to genes producing ROS (Fig. 1A). Although it is known that ecotype differences can diversify the ROS signatures associated with stress responses on Earth (Kalbina and Strid 2006; Li et al. 2006, 2008), these results are the first to demonstrate that different ecotypes use different specific subcellular ROS species to respond to the spaceflight environment (Fig. 1). Previous morphological differences between Col-0 and WS ecotypes in the spaceflight environment were primarily observed in the roots. Although the overall root length at 11 days on orbit between the two ecotypes showed no significant difference (Paul et al. 2017), it was noted that the Col-0 ecotype showed a dramatic lag in root development during the first 48-h post-germination in orbit when compared to the WS ecotype, and that there are also ecotype-specific differences in root growth behaviour (Paul et al. 2012a). One difference between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes is the regulation of class III peroxidase genes (Passardi et al. 2007). In fact, two genes PE10 (AT1G49570) and PE59 (AT5G19890) that were up-regulated in the APEX03-2 Col-0 but remained unchanged in APEX03-2 WS (Fig. 1B) are involved in controlling the root cell elongation process (Markakis et al. 2012). The differentially expressed peroxidase genes between the two ecotypes in the APEX03-2 spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1B) reinforce the notion that different ecotypes utilize ROS differently to respond to their environment and suggest that in WS, these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged. In addition, the observed down-regulation of peroxidases in Col-0 was consonant with observations previously published (Kwon et al. 2015). Since peroxidases are necessary for the general oxidoreduction of H2O2 in general, the down-regulation of peroxidases in spaceflight within Col-0 could contribute to Col-0-specific ROS signatures seen in clusters A and B of the ROSMETER analyses (Fig. 1A). The current ROSMETER analysis is not intended to define how specific ecotypes utilize peroxidases or regulate specific ROS indices in response to spaceflight. Rather, it is to illustrate that the genetic background of the spaceflight-grown plant had a substantial impact on the specific subcellular ROS species that were used in the physiological response. OMG1 transcript is consistently up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments and is induced rapidly upon wounding in both WS and Col-0 OMG1 is consistently induced in spaceflight in WS but not Col-0. Comparisons of the 5′ upstream region, the coding region and the 3′ UTR of OMG1 between the two ecotypes showed no differences in the primary sequence. However, in the intergenic region downstream of the OMG1 stop codon, a point mutation is observed at positions 2197, 3327, and a two-nucleotide deletion is observed at position 3488 [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S4]. Wassilewskija and Col-0 do regulate OMG1 differently. OMG1 showed slight differences in basal expression between Col-0 and WS, and both ecotypes demonstrated immediate up-regulation of OMG1 after wounding, along with the rapid diminishing of the signal afterwards [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5A]. However, Col-0 and WS responded very differently in a wounding dosage test, where leaves were subjected to various degrees of damage at the onset of wounding (‘immediate’ time point) [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5B]. Irrespective of the extent of the wounded surface area of the leaf, Col-0 expressed OMG1 at a consistent level, whereas WS expressed OMG1 in a dose-response manner [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5C]. These results suggest that OMG1 is involved in a rapid wounding response in both Col-0 and WS ecotypes but with different modes of regulation. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes are genotypically distinct, and their transcriptomic responses to environmental and developmental cues can be dissimilar (e.g. Chen et al. 2005; Kusunoki et al. 2017). The overall spaceflight transcriptomes of WS and Col-0 are dramatically different (Paul et al. 2017). It is hypothesized that even though OMG1 is functional in both ecotypes upon wounding, other gene products or pathways present in Col-0 but not WS could compensate for the ‘need’ for OMG1 in space, or that these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged in the spaceflight transcriptome. Although OMG1’s role in the physiological adaptation of WS to spaceflight has yet to be discerned, its strong induction suggests that OMG1 contributes to a successful adjustment to that environment. Irrespective of OMG1’s specific role in spaceflight physiology, it is noteworthy that OMG1’s overall metabolic function, which was previously unknown, was only discovered because of its role in spaceflight physiology. OMG1 is associated with the regulation of ROS OMG1 is associated with ROS regulation. The location of OMG1 promoter region activity coincided with regions of dynamic ROS activity. OMG1 specifically regulated the expression of two ROS-associated genes (GRX480 and MYB77). And, loss of OMG1 protein in omg1 resulted in deviations from WT in two different ROS assays. The rapid induction of OMG1 expression immediately after wounding was observed with a promoter-driven GUS reporter qRT-PCR analysis. Rapid induction of transcription (prior to 2-min post-stimulus) has been observed in gravitational and mechanical stimulation of Arabidopsis root apical tissues (Kimbrough et al. 2004). In addition, wounding Arabidopsis leaves produces ROS within minutes at the wound site (Miller et al. 2009; Beneloujaephajri et al. 2013) and this rapid response is necessary for plants to elicit immediate defence/repair mechanisms against herbivore and pathogen attacks. Wounded plants can transmit rapid RBOHD-dependent ROS signals of speeds up to 8.4 cm min−1 to mediate long-distance cell-to-cell communication (Miller et al. 2009). However, since no statistical differences were seen in the expression level of RbohD in Col-0 WT plants and omg1 KO plants (Fig. 6D), this suggests that the changes in extracellular or intracellular ROS are not a result of altered expression of RbohD in the omg1 KO line. Reactive oxygen species molecules are essential signalling molecules in plant growth and development but can also act as toxic stressors. Therefore, there exists an elaborate and highly redundant network of genes that maintain the delicate ROS homeostasis (Gechev et al. 2006). Functional OMG1 is necessary for rapid generation of intracellular ROS at the wound site (Fig. 6A and B). However, over time these ROS return to WT levels, presumably facilitated by other genes of redundant function [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S6]. In a recent review, it has been suggested that altered ROS signalling in response to the spaceflight environment could affect plant growth and development indirectly via changes in hormonal influx within the plants (Schüler et al. 2015). OMG1 was found to regulate the expression of ROS-associated genes GRX480 and MYB77. GRX480/GRXC9 is a member of the glutaredoxin (GRX) family of small redox enzymes. GRX480 is a salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene induced quickly and transiently by an NPR1-independent pathway, which is associated with the ROS-scavenging/antioxidant network (Laporte et al. 2012; Zander et al. 2012; Herrera-Vásquez et al. 2015a; Huang et al. 2016). MYB77 is a member of the R2R3-type transcription factor family that is involved in ROS metabolism through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade is also known to play a role in plant development and hormone signalling and includes hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), SA and ethylene (ET) (Shin and Schachtman 2004; Teige et al. 2004; Galvez-Valdivieso et al. 2009; Herrera-Vásquez et al. 2015b). OMG1’s role in ROS signalling was established with two frequently used ROS biochemical assays. The DCF-DA assay showed that intracellular ROS production around the wound site was dampened in the omg1 mutant, whereas flg22-induced extracellular ROS production was 20 % higher than WT in the omg1 mutant. These conflicting results can be addressed by the different signalling pathways elicited by each stimulus. Responses to mechanical damage can be localized, systemic or both. In any case, the response involves the generation, translocation, perception and transduction of wound signals to activate the expression of wound‐inducible genes. In response to mechanical wounding, the central role for JA signalling is well established. However, many other compounds, such as oligopeptide systemin, oligosaccharides, phytohormones, hydraulic pressure or electrical pulses, have also been proposed to play a role in wound signalling (León et al. 2001). Early localized ROS induced by wounding, specifically O2•−, H2O2 and singlet oxygen, have been suggested to originate intracellularly from the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts (Morker and Roberts 2011). On the other hand, flg22, a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), elicits an early response that includes SA-, JA- and ET-defence signalling pathways. Flg22 also elicits a late response that includes activation of defence-related senescence processes, SA-dependent secretory pathway genes and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) expression (Denoux et al. 2008). MAMP-induced ROS have been shown to originate from the apoplast through activation of NADPH oxidases as well as peroxidases (Jwa and Hwang 2017). Although there are crosstalks between signalling pathways induced by mechanical wounding and flg22, there are also unique pathways induced by each stimulus that could attribute to the different results observed. Details of these mechanisms are still being investigated; however, the results infer that within the Brassicaceae family OMG1 does play a role in the ROS signalling pathway. Phylogeny and protein architecture of OMG1 Prior to this study, members of the Arabidopsis CO and COL family were thought to only function in photoperiod signalling that involves flowering, circadian rhythms, stomata opening and root-shoot branching (Gangappa and Botto 2014). Evidence presented here suggests that members of this family play a role in ROS signalling. This, in turn, could aid in the functional characterization of many of the other uncharacterized members such as COL11 and COL12. We suggest that divergent function of OMG1 can be attributed to the evolved B-box1 and B-box2 domains. This is in line with reports on the rapid evolution of COL genes within the Brassicaceae, in which the increased evolutionary rates were observed not only in the middle region of the protein but also in the conserved zinc-finger and basic CCT regions (Lagercrantz and Axelsson 2000).",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion OMG1 is a CCT domain transcriptional regulator of ROS homeostasis, one that is important to the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis ecotype WS to spaceflight. While investigations are underway to determine the detailed mechanisms of how OMG1 regulates the ROS homeostasis in wounding, and its specific role in spaceflight, the results presented here demonstrate several important concepts for general consideration. First, spaceflight experiments are useful platforms to discover novel gene functions and provide fundamental insights into terrestrial plant biology. Second, the response to spaceflight is genotype-specific and this understanding should be taken into consideration when defining the overall plant spaceflight response. WS and Col-0 differ in induction of OMG1 in spaceflight. Third, the maintenance of ROS homeostasis plays an important role as plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight. And, last, the CONSTANS-Like family contains members that function well beyond the clock and timing roles typically associated with CCT domains, including ROS signalling.",

Copyright notice ID: 6348315 PMID: 30705745 Abstract A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation. Keywords: Arabidopsis thaliana, B-box domain, CONSTANS-Like, ecotype-specific, microgravity, reactive oxygen species, spaceflight, transcription factor, uncharacterized genes Plants adjust to spaceflight by changing patterns of gene expression. The analysis of how different Arabidopsis plants respond to space resulted in the discovery of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1), which was consistently induced in space. This research revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CONSTANS-Like protein family and is involved in maintaining the reactive oxygen species pathway, which appears to be an important feature of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. It also shows that spaceflight experiments can be used as a platform to discover novel gene function and provide further insights into terrestrial plant biology.Introduction The complex networks and signalling pathways that equip plants to cope with environmental challenge developed over evolutionary time in terrestrial environments. Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs (Cowles et al. 1984; Hoson et al. 2002; Soga et al. 2002; Paul et al. 2013a; Ferl et al. 2014). Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response (Paul et al. 2017), thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments. The physiological impact of spaceflight is reflected in the patterns of gene expression. Irrespective of plant growth hardware, duration in space or age of plants, one consensus is that spaceflight elicits responses from pathways associated with cell wall remodelling, cell polarity, phytohormone-mediated processes, as well as general stress responses, such as wounding, pathogen defence, heat shock and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Joo et al. 2001; Paul et al. 2005, 2012b, 2013a; Correll et al. 2013; Zupanska et al. 2013; Ferl et al. 2014; Mazars et al. 2014; Sugimoto et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Kwon et al. 2015; Schüler et al. 2015). In addition, a large proportion of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight encode unknown proteins. Spaceflight-grown Arabidopsis roots tend to be smaller, have fewer lateral roots and shorter root hair development than their terrestrial controls (Paul et al. 2012a; Kwon et al. 2015). Aspects of these morphologies in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) suggest a relationship between the down-regulation of several peroxidase genes in spaceflight (Kwon et al. 2015). In this study, a spaceflight-induced gene of unknown function identified from roots was investigated for its potential involvement in ROS-related functions. AT1G05290, which we have dubbed Orbitally Manifested Gene 1 (OMG1), was one of the highest significantly (P = 0.0005) induced genes in the Advanced Plant Experiment 01 (APEX01) spaceflight data set (fold change = 12) (Paul et al. 2013a). Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks around OMG1 show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathways Obayashi et al. 2014. OMG1 was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes (Shin and Schachtman 2004; Potocký et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2007; Lassig et al. 2014). In addition, OMG1 is an unrealized member of the CONSTANS-Like family of transcription factors. These findings, originating with the novel environment of spaceflight, further the understanding of plant growth and development and provide insight into the role of a heretofore unknown gene.Materials and Methods ROSMETER analysis The ROSMETER tool assesses the ROS-related transcriptomic signature in a large-scale Arabidopsis gene expression data set (Rosenwasser et al. 2013). Arabidopsis gene expression profiles from two independent spaceflight experiments, APEX01 and Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2), along with their corresponding ground controls, were used to correlate differential gene expression in spaceflight with specific ROS species and origins. The APEX01 experiment utilized two ecotypes and both were planted on each plate of the experiment. Since the entire plate was harvested on orbit to a single tube, the subsequent transcriptomic analyses comprised 60 % Wassilewskija (WS) and 40 % Col-0 (Paul et al. 2013b). In the APEX03-2 data set, WS and Col-0 were kept on separate plates, harvested into separate tubes and analysed individually. A data set from Col-0 compared to WS vertically grown in standard laboratory conditions was included as an additional control (Schultz et al. 2017). From each data set, Affymetrix Probeset-ID, Gene Locus ID, P-value and fold change were listed and submitted to ROSMETER. The heatmap was constructed using the GENE-E software with hierarchical clustering using the Matrix value offered in the software.Plant materials and growth conditions Seeds from both Col-0 and WS were prepared for APEX01 and APEX03-2 as previously described (Paul et al. 2012b, 2013b; Sng et al. 2014; Ferl and Paul 2016). Briefly, plants were cultured on Phytagel™ 10 cm Petri plates and grown either in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware (APEX01), or in the Veggie hardware (APEX03-2) under continuous lighting of ~80–135 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR. In this study, the effects of the spaceflight environment were evaluated, which includes ambient radiation, microgravity and attending effects on convection. In both experiments, the ground control plants were grown with a 24- to 48-h schedule delay that allowed the comparable ground growth chambers to be programmed with the precise environmental conditions that the International Space Station (ISS)-grown plants received on orbit. Plants grown for additional laboratory analyses were grown on Phytagel™ 10 cm plates or in soil, and placed in a greenhouse growth chamber on a 24-h light cycle (~80 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR) at 22 °C.OMG1 promoter::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants and analyses A 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region upstream of the OMG1 (AT1G05290) initial Met was amplified from Arabidopsis gDNA using primer pair A [seeSupporting Information—Table S1], which contains restriction enzyme sites BamHI in the forward primer and NcoI in the reverse. The sequenced and confirmed BamHI/NcoI fragment containing the OMG1 5′ flanking region was cloned into pCAMBIA1303 to create the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 fusion construct. Although this region may not represent the full complement of motifs that regulate OMG1, the 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region does serve to promote OMG1 transcription and will be referred to as the basal promoter. The construct was then transformed into Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) strain GV3101 for floral dip transformation into WS plants (Clough and Bent 1998). Ten independent OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic lines grown on selection media (250 mg L−1 Carbenecillin and 50 mg L−1 Hygromycin) were screened for T3 homozygosity. Plants grown on Phytagel plates were used for histochemical localization of β-glucuronidase (GUS) (Jefferson et al. 1987). Pollen and pollen tube analyses were performed as described (Li et al. 1999). T1 heterozygous populations of pollen grains and tubes were incubated with X-Gluc to reveal the specificity of the histochemical localization in transformed pollen. Basal OMG1 promoter activity in plants requires ~3 h of staining before detection of GUS in the various locations, whereas GUS activity induced by wounding was observed within 30 min of staining. In the GUS qRT-PCR wounding experiments with OMG1p::GUSmgfp5, comparable leaves from three individual plants were crimped with forceps and left intact on the plant for the duration of each time point (30 min, 1, 4 and 16 h). Leaves were harvested to liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. In the mock and immediate time point, leaves were either unwounded or crimped and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA transcribed from total RNA was used to analyse the transcript abundance of GUSA. Primer pairs B and C [seeSupporting Information—Table S1] were used for the analyses. GUSA transcript abundance was normalized to UBQ11 (AT4G05050).Gene expression analyses of OMG1 and other downstream genes OMG1 RT-qPCR analyses used TaqMan™ (Applied Biosystems) on spaceflight material from APEX01 and APEX03-2. OMG1 gene expression was normalized to UBQ11 primer and probe sequences D and E [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. The omg1 knockout (KO) line (SALK_045742C) was validated for a homozygous T-DNA insertion using primers F. Homozygous lines were selfed until all progeny were homozygous and screened for the absence of full-length OMG1 transcript [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S1]. RT-qPCR analyses of OMG1 expression induced by a time course wounding assay were performed on wild-type (WT) Col-0, WS and omg1 lines. Three individual plants with leaves of similar ages and sizes were wounded by crushing between two glass slides. The wounded leaves were left attached to the plant for the allotted times (mock, immediate, 5, 10, 30 min and 1 h) before being harvested into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RT-qPCR analysis was conducted using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) along with the primer pairs C, D (without probe), G–H and L–R [seeSupporting Information—Table S1].Fluorescent biochemical ROS assays For the ROS accumulation assay, intact leaves from WT Col-0, omg1 KO and rbohd KO (SALK_070610) were wounded with a 10 µL pipette tip and immediately immersed into the fluorescent probe 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichloro dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Sigma) solution as described in (Beneloujaephajri et al. 2013). Briefly, wounded and unwounded leaves were vacuum infiltrated in the dark for 20 min in 60 µM of DCF-DA in standard buffer. Leaves were then rinsed in standard buffer and observed under GFP bandpass filters using the Olympus BX51 compound light microscope at 10× magnification with 55 ms exposure time. Quantification of fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software was previously described (Jakic et al. 2017). A luminol-based ROS assay was done by measuring hydrogen peroxide produced by leaf discs when exposed to flg22. Discs (0.125 cm2) of 6-week-old WT Col-0, omg1 and rbohd plants were incubated in 100 µL ddH2O overnight in 96-well luminometer plates. Water was replaced with the reaction solution of 40 µM luminol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 µg mL−1 horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 50 nM of flg22 or water for the mock controls. ROS measurements expressed as means of RLU (relative light units) were taken at 2-min intervals for a period of 38 min.Phylogenetic analysis Protein sequences were identified by rpsblast search of the NR database (Marchler-Bauer and Bryant 2004; Marchler-Bauer et al. 2015;  Resource Coordinators 2016); full-length protein sequences containing a single CCT domain (pfam06203) with e-value < 0.01 were considered potential OMG1 homologs. Protein sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega v1.2.3 (Sievers et al. 2011), PROBALIGN (Roshan and Livesay 2006), MUSCLE v3.8.31 (Edgar 2004), MSAProbs v0.97 (Liu et al. 2010), PROBCONS (Do et al. 2005) and mafft-einsi v7.215 (Katoh and Standley 2013), with default parameters. Alignments were left unprocessed or processed by Gblocks v0.91 to remove potentially ambiguous regions (Talavera and Castresana 2007). The minimum number of sequences for a flank position (-b2) was 3/5 the total number of sequences. The maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions (-b3) was 10. The minimum block length (-b4) was 5, and gap positions were allowed (-b5 = a). Other Gblocks parameters were left at default values. Initial maximum likelihood phylogenies were constructed from each alignment using FastTree v2.1.7 with default parameters (Price et al. 2010). Initial trees were used as starting trees for full maximum likelihood reconstruction using RAxML v8.2.8 (Stamatakis 2014). Maximum likelihood phylogenies produced from each alignment were converted to a clade presence-absence matrix using the Super Tree Toolkit v0.1.2 (Hill and Davis 2014), and a supertree was inferred from this matrix using the BINCAT model in RAxML (Nguyen et al. 2012). Additionally, all individual sequence alignments were concatenated into a single supermatrix, which was used to infer the maximum likelihood protein family phylogeny using RAxML, with the best-fit evolutionary model selected by AIC (Wheeler et al. 1995). A consensus of ‘supertree’ and ‘supermatrix’ results was plotted using FigTree v1.4.3. Protein structural modelling of the B-box2 domain was done using both the Phyre2 and Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004). The closest OMG1 homolog, c2junA of the human Midline-1 (MID1) with a 92 % confidence level was used to predict the overall folding of the B-box domains in OMG1. The predicted structural model of OMG1 was compared to the x-ray crystal structure of c2junA using Chimera and MatchMaker. Side chains positioned near the zinc ions were displayed to predict the potential of OMG1 binding to zinc ions.35S promoter:OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion construct for subcellular localization The coding sequence of OMG1 (RefSeq ID:NP_172021.2) was amplified from cDNA using primer pair I [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. The PCR fragment was sequenced before being cloned into the pCAMBIA1303 along with sGFP(S65T) (Chiu et al. 1996) gene via SpeI and BstEII restriction sites using primer pairs J [seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Primer pair K was then used to amplify the entire OMG1cds-sGFP(S65T), which was validated by sequencing and cloned into pCAMBIA1302 vector via NcoI and BstEII restriction sites. For subcellular localization, Agrobacterium-GV3101 containing 100 µM acetosyringone, 0.05 % Silwet-77 and the pCAMBIA1302 vector or pCAMBIA1302-OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion vector were incubated in the dark for 20 min at 28 °C. Leaves of 4-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) seedlings were injected and GFP signal was observed after 2 days at 25 °C in the dark. DAPI was used to indicate the nucleus.Results ROS-producing genes are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight in an ecotype-specific manner The differential gene expression data sets of the three independent spaceflight experiments and their comparable ground controls were used in the ROSMETER analyses. The heatmap shows the positive-(red), negative-(blue) and no correlation-(black) between the ROS indices and the queried spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1A). A general positive correlation of ROS-producing genes was observed in all the spaceflight transcriptomes and hierarchical clustering displayed a higher similarity with the APEX03-2_WS data set compared to the APEX03-2_Col-0 data set. Two interesting ROS correlation groups were observed in the heatmap. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2 ROS indices, whereas in the Col-0 background cytosolic ROS shows no correlation. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. Specifically, TDNA-AOX-MLD and Retenone-3h indices showed that if one ecotype had a positive correlation the other had no correlation. In addition, in the Retenone-12h and TDNA-AOX indices, the mixed ecotype transcriptome shows a similar trend to one of the two ecotypes. The control data set, which reflects terrestrial ecotype differences between Col-0 and WS, showed that many of the genes differentially expressed between the two ecotypes are associated with the ROS-scavenging mechanism. A representative transcriptome heatmap from the APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment that compared several significantly (P < 0.01) differentially expressed (>1 or −1 < log2 fold change) peroxidase genes between 4-day-old Col-0 and WS ecotypes illustrated that Col-0 alters the expression of many more peroxidase genes in spaceflight than does WS (Fig. 1B). Peroxidases, an integral part of ROS signalling in cell wall remodelling, cell elongation, auxin catabolism, and response to abiotic and biotic stress, (Shigeto and Tsutsumi 2016) were found to be differentially expressed in spaceflight. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Correlations between spaceflight transcriptome and ROS-related microarrays revealed that ROS is induced in spaceflight in an ecotype-dependent manner. (A) The microarray (APEX01) and the RNAseq (APEX03-2) analyses of spaceflight transcriptional profile relative to the ground control profile were correlated to known ROS-related data sets producing specific ROS species from specific locations within the cell using the bioinformatics tool called ROSMETER (Rosenwasser et al. 2013). Positive correlations (red) show ROS production, whereas negative correlations (blue) show ROS scavenging. Black cells suggest no correlations, whereas gray cells indicate that there are insufficient gene numbers for a statistical correlation. Clusters highlighted in yellow boxes denote regions of interest. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2 ROS indices. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. (B) Peroxidase genes having statically (P < 0.01) differential expression (>1 or −1 < log2 fold) between spaceflight and ground control in both WS and Col-0 ecotypes are depicted. Blue is indicative of down-regulation, red is indicative of up-regulation and gray indicates no statistically significant differential expression.OMG1 transcript is up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments OMG1 expression was up-regulated in WS roots across multiple spaceflight experiments (APEX01-1B, APEX01-2B and APEX03-2) but remained unchanged in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The Box-Whisker plot of Fig. 2 illustrates the median fold change of OMG1 expression between spaceflight and the ground control from a total of nine replicates from each sample. Each spaceflight experiment represents a distinct launch and orbital plant growth event. In both the APEX01 experiments, seeds germinated on orbit grew for 12 days before being harvested. OMG1 expression shows a 4-fold change in spaceflight compared to ground controls in APEX01-2B and 3.5-fold change in APEX01-1B. In both analyses, the large spread between the maximum and the minimum can be attributed to the mixture of ecotypes. In a subsequent spaceflight experiment, APEX03-2, plants grew for 8 or 11 days on the ISS before being harvested. In the APEX03-2 8-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 (no change), whereas WS showed a 3.9-fold increase in spaceflight. In the APEX03-2 11-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 and WS showed a 2.1-fold increase in expression. Figure 2. Open in a new tab OMG1 transcripts are up-regulated in WS but unchanged in Col-0 consistently over multiple spaceflight experiments. Ecotypes WS or Col-0 were grown onboard the ISS for the number of days (d) indicated, harvested and compared to comparable ground controls. OMG1 transcripts for flight and ground control samples assayed with qRT-PCR. Spaceflight experiment APEX01-2B launched to the ISS via STS131 and analyses published in Paul et al. (2013b). The same RNA used in the 12d APEX01 microarrays was used for qRT-PCR shown here. Spaceflight experiment APEX01-1B launched to the ISS via STS129, and spaceflight experiment APEX03-2, 8 day and 11 day was launched to the ISS via SpaceX05. Boxplots were constructed from nine replicates for each sample. Expressions were normalized to UBQ11 and plotted spaceflight relative to ground control using results generated from TaqMan™ qRT-PCR. Spaceflight experiments show that OMG1 transcript is up-regulated in spaceflight relative to ground controls in WS plants, whereas in Col-0 it remains largely unchanged. Significance *(P < 0.01), ** (P < 0.001) between samples is calculated by doing a single-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction.The OMG1 basal promoter activity was observed in roots, pollen tubes and upon wounding Histochemical GUS staining revealed some basal OMG1 promoter activity in roots and pollen but showed heighten activity upon wounding in the roots and leaves. T3 homozygous OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants were used to characterize the activity of the OMG1 promoter. In roots, basal OMG1 promoter activity was observed at low levels in the maturation zone of both the primary and lateral roots and root hairs (Fig. 3A, i–iv). In addition, basal promoter activity was also observed in pollen grains and pollen tubes (Fig. 3A, v–vii). A T1 heterozygous population of pollen grains grown in pollen germinating media (Fig. 3A, vii) was used to visualize the specificity of the GUS enzymatic reactions in transformed pollen. Serendipitously, wounded plant tissues were observed to have heightened OMG1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Figure 3. Open in a new tab A transgenic reporter line OMG1 promoter::GusGFP in the WS ecotype background shows OMG1 5′ flanking region activity. (A) Transgenic Arabidopsis plants of various ages underwent histochemical GUS staining with X-Gluc. The images show representative distribution patterns of GUS staining in (i) maturation zone of roots, (ii–iii) lateral roots, (iv) root hairs of the maturation zone, (v–vii) pollen and pollen tubes. Scale bars: (i–ii) 1 mm; (iii–vii) 100 µm. (B) OMG1 5′ flanking region activity was also observed upon wounding with a pair of forceps. Wild-type (WT) Col-0, Adh promoter::Gus transgenic line were used as a control to ensure GUS enzymatic activity was specific for OMG1 5′ flanking region. Both leaf (i–iii) and root tissue (iv–vi) from the various lines were used. Scale bars: 100 µm. (C) Intact leaf tissues were wounded and left for the allotted times before they were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis. The GUS transcript abundance fold change relative to mock was done to access the rapid wounding response of OMG1 5′ flanking region. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) of triplicate representative experiments. * indicate significant (P < 0.05) difference between immediate and the various wounding time points by doing a single-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction.To ensure that OMG1 promoter activity was specific to wounding, leaf and root tissues from WT Col-0, ADHp::GUS (Chung and Ferl 1999) and OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 lines were wounded with a pair of forceps. In this wounding experiment, GUS staining was observed only in the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 line. A qRT-PCR analysis of GUSA transcripts from leaves wounded at different time points showed that OMG1 promoter activity heightens immediately after wounding and dissipates after 30 min (Fig. 3C).OMG1 regulates the expression of MYB77 and GRX480 known to be induced in spaceflight and upon wounding Eight genes [seeSupporting Information—Table S2] were used to elucidate potential functional interactions with OMG1. Since OMG1 promoter activity was shown to rise immediately after wounding (Fig. 3C), a wounding time course of mock, immediate, 10 min and 1 h was used to screen the expression of the genes listed in Supporting Information—Table S2 that could be affected by knocking out OMG1. Two genes, GRX480 (At1g28480) and MYB77 (At3g50060), out of eight genes tested showed significant differences (Student’s t-test P < 0.05) in gene expression between WT and omg1 lines (Fig. 4D and F). The expression of GRX480 was repressed after wounding in the omg1 line and did not increase as did the WT line. On the other hand, MYB77 expressed in the omg1 line showed a significant delay in down-regulating gene expression when compared to the WT at the 10-min post-wounding time point. MYB77 and GRX480 were significantly differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 5). Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1.7 and WS showed a 3-fold increase in MYB77 expression in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5A). In the GRX480 analyses, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 0.3 and WS showed a median fold change of 1.3 in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab OMG1 regulates the rapid wounding response of MYB77 and GRX480. WT Col-0 and omg1 KO intact leaf tissues were untouched (mock) or wounded with a pair of forceps and left for the indicated time points before harvesting for qRT-PCR analyses. Expression of the indicated genes (A–H) shared between spaceflight, rapid wounding and pollen development [seeSupporting Information—Table S2] in the WT (Col-0) and omg1 KO leaves was analysed. Untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding were the indicated time points that the transcripts were measured. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. * indicate significance (P < 0.05), ** (P < 0.001) between WT Col-0 and omg1 which was calculated by doing a two-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc Student’s t-test. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments.Figure 5. Open in a new tab MYB77 and GRX480 expression of APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment showed higher fold change in WS compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (A) qRT-PCR done on APEX03-2 11d spaceflight root tissue show that MYB77 transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls is significantly (P = 0.001) different between WS and Col-0 plants. The fold change of MYB77 expression is higher in the WS ecotype compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (B) qRT-PCR showed a significant (P = 0.007) difference in the expression fold change of GRX480 between Col-0 and WS plants. Boxplots were derived from nine replicates normalized to UBQ11 and plotted spaceflight relative to ground control. ** indicate (P < 0.01) significant difference between Col-0 and WS was calculated by doing a Student’s t-test.ROS accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered in omg1 KO leaves compared to Col-0 leaves Wild-type Col-0, omg1 and respiratory burst oxidase homology D (rbohd) KO plants, which are delayed in ROS accumulation (Miller et al. 2009), were subjected to mechanical wounding with a pipette tip. The production of hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cells was measured with DCF-DA assay. Green fluorescence at the site of wounding was captured after 20 min with light microscopy. Wild-type Col-0 leaves produced ROS around the wound site, whereas neither omg1 nor rbohd showed prominent production of ROS (Fig. 6A). Quantification of fluorescence using ImageJ showed significant differences (Student’s t-test P < 0.01) between Col-0 and the mutant lines (Fig. 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered in omg1 leaves compared to Col-0 leaves. (A and B) DCF-DA ROS assay performed on wounded leaf tissues reveals that OMG1 affects cellular ROS production. (A) DCF-DA is a fluorogenic dye that measures hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cell. A pipette tip was used to wound the surface of the leaves from the WT line, omg1 KO line and rbohd KO line (a known ROS-deficient mutant). Upon wounding, ROS is usually produced around the site of injury. The DCF-DA reagent is then oxidized by ROS resulting in appearance of green fluorescence. Plants were wounded and immediately placed in the DCF-DA solution for 20 min before visualized on the light microscope. (i) WT Col-0 leaves without wounding, (ii) WT Col-0 leaves, (iii) omg1 leaves and (iv) rbohd leaves were placed in DCF-DA solution immediately after wounding. In the WT plants green fluorescence around the wound site indicates the production of ROS. However, in the omg1 KO line and the rbohd KO line, ROS production was not detected. Images were taken on the Olympus BX51 compound scope at 10× magnification, exposure time 55 ms. Scale bars: 100 µm. (B) Quantification of fluorescence was performed using integrated density (IntDen) and corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) [CTCF = Integrated density − (Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings)] in ImageJ. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test, bar graphs with different letters show significant difference (P < 0.01). (C and D) Higher elicitor-induced oxidative burst in omg1 KO is not associated with altered expression of RbohD. (C) Extracellular ROS production was measured using a luminol-based assay in leaf discs from omg1 KO, rbohd KO and WT Col-0 plants after elicitation with water or flg22. Experiments were repeated at least three times and results are a mean of 24 samples. (D) The relative expression of RbohD in the WT (Col-0) and omg1 KO leaves was analysed in a wounding assay untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. No significant difference in RbohD expression between Col-0 and omg1 KO plants was observed when the Student’s t-test analysis was performed. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments.Based on luminol ROS assays OMG1 affects the elicitor-induced generation of extracellular ROS. Flg22-induced hydrogen peroxide production by leaf discs of omg1 mutants was ~20 % higher compared to Col-0. Water-treated controls along with the rbohd leaf discs showed no production of flg22-induced H2O2 (Fig. 6C). Since elicitor-induced extracellular ROS is governed by RbohD, the measurement of RbohD expression between Col-0 and omg1 lines in a wounding time course was analysed (Fig. 6D). The relative expression of RbohD showed no significant difference between WT and omg1 leaves.OMG1 is a member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family The predicted OMG1 gene encodes a 369 amino acid protein that contains a C-terminal 43 amino acid sequence that is 84 % sequence similarity to the (CONSTANS (CO), CONSTANS-Like (COL) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1)) ‘CCT’ domain (Berardini et al. 2015). OMG1 also contains two divergent B-box domains in the N-terminal region [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S2]. The OMG1 B-box1 domain has 51 % similarity to the B-box1 consensus sequence, and the OMG1 B-box2 domain has a 94 % similarity to the B-box2 consensus sequence (Griffiths et al. 2003; Masaki et al. 2005; Gangappa and Botto 2014). A consensus phylogeny suggests that OMG1 belongs to group II of the CO and COL family of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 6). Maximum likelihood phylogenies placed a clade of OMG1-related sequences from Brassicas and Monocots (SH-like aLRT > 0.989) close to COL11-12 sequences from across flowering plants [seeSupporting Information—Table S3]. OMG1 appears closely related to the COL11-12 and COL9-10 lineages, although the precise placement of the OMG1 group remains unresolved. Both the OMG1 and the COL11-12 clades consist of sequences representing both monocots and dicots. In the consensus tree, a single COL11-12-like sequence from the basal flowering plant Amborella trichopoda rooted the OMG1 and COL11-12 clades (SH-like aLRT > 0.912), suggesting that the OMG1 lineage arose via a gene-duplication event in flowering plants, prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots (Fig. 7). However, no OMG1-related sequences from Eudicots were observed outside the Brassicaceae family, suggesting that either OMG1 was lost from non-Brassica dicots, or the sequence has diverged so much in these lineages as to be unrecognizable. The different alignment and tree-reconstruction procedures support the early-duplication hypothesis, and make it unlikely that the grouping of monocot and dicot OMG1-related sequences is a phylogenetic artefact. Figure 7. Open in a new tab OMG1 is a member of the CO and COL protein family in Arabidopsis. The consensus tree derived from full-length protein sequences containing a single CCT domain of all plants found in the non-redundant (NR) database revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CO and COL family of proteins. In Arabidopsis (taxa highlighted in cyan), the COL family can be divided into three groups. Group I (shaded in light blue) comprises of CO, COL1-6 which have domain structures consisting of two B-box domains (type I and type II) at the N-terminal and both a VP motif along with a CCT domain at the C-terminal. Genes in group II (shaded in light purple) comprising of COL9-15 and OMG1 have domain structure consisting of a type I B-box domain and a second diverged B-box2 domain along with a C-terminal CCT domain. The OMG1 clade is highlighted in red, whereas its closest homolog COL11-12 is highlighted in green. Group III (shaded in light orange) comprises of COL6-8 and COL16 have domain structures consisting of a single B-box1 domain and a CCT domain. Listed in the grey boxes are the characterized functions of some of the COL members (Gangappa and Botto 2014).The high level of sequence divergence in the OMG1 B-box1 domain is primarily due to a 13-amino acid deletion close to the start of the B-box1 consensus sequence CX-------------XAXLCX2CDX3H (Fig. 7). This B-box1 deletion was observed across several Brassica sequences nested within the OMG1 clade, but this deletion was not found in monocot OMG1, suggesting it probably occurred late in the Brassicaceae lineage. Although the OMG1 B-box2 domain is largely conserved (Fig. 8), two highly conserved consensus amino acids are different in OMG1 compared to the consensus sequence CX2CX7-10CX7CX2CX5-12H. The third cysteine in the consensus sequence is serine in OMG1 (C49S), and the histidine at the end of the consensus sequence is leucine (H73L). Examination of B-box2 domains outside the OMG1 clade suggests that these substitutions are unique to the OMG1 clade [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3]. Figure 8. Open in a new tab OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11 and 12 and underwent a subsequent B-box1 deletion event. OMG1 and CONSTANS-Like (COL) 11-12 are sister clades based on the consensus tree described in Fig. 8, suggesting that OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11-12 (indicated by the circle). Sequences within the OMG1 clade are grouped into Brassicas and monocots. The Brassica sequences highlighted in red, share a similar B-box1 deletion indicated by the triangle and reflected in the adjacent B-box1 domain sequences derived using the AliView software. The B-box1 consensus sequence (Gangappa and Botto 2014) is listed and regions where the deletion occurs are highlighted in blue. The consensus tree depicted here is not drawn to scale.The B-box domain family belongs to a subgroup of zinc-binding proteins stabilized by canonical cysteine-rich zinc-finger motifs (Klug and Schwabe 1995). The inferred structure of Zn-bound OMG1 B-box2 suggests that OMG1 is capable of stably binding at least one zinc ion, via a canonical zinc-finger motif (Fig. 9). In the model, four conserved cysteine residues surrounding the CX2C configuration were spatially positioned in a similar fashion as the amino acids surrounding the first Zn-binding site in the human MID1 template, suggesting this first OMG1 Zn-binding site retains a canonical zinc-finger structure. Figure 9. Open in a new tab The B-box2 domain of OMG1 is predicted to bind at least one zinc ion. The sequence of B-box2 domain was compared between Arabidopsis COL11-12, OMG1 and the basal species Amborella trichopoda. The consensus sequence of the B-box2 domain is listed and OMG1 seems to have a relatively conserved B-box2 domain except for the residues highlighted in blue. Residues within the COL sequences that create a zinc-binding interface are indicated by the black lines, whereas residues that might create a second zinc-binding interface are indicated by the blue lines. The human MID1 sequence is also listed and residues that bind to the first zinc ion are highlighted in pink, whereas residues that bind to the second zinc ion are highlighted in blue. OMG1 B-box2 domain was modelled after a well-characterized B-box2 found in the Human MID1 protein located in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Modelling of the protein was done using the Chimera protein modelling software. In the Arabidopsis OMG1 protein, four cysteines are positioned such that they interact with a zinc ion. However, the substitution of amino acids around the second zinc-binding region shows strong evidence for the loss of the second Zn-binding site as modelled in the human MID1 template.However, radical substitutions at key Zn-binding sites (C49S, E52Q, C67I and H73L) occurring in the second Zn-binding pocket of OMG1’s B-box2 motif appear to completely disrupt potential Zn-binding (Fig. 9). It remains unclear whether the series of indels and substitutions after the OMG1 B-box2 domain could result in a novel structure that facilitates zinc ion binding or a different functional motif. Furthermore, sequences within the OMG1 clade show similar substitutions at most of these conserved Zn-binding residues, implicating the possibility that functional B-box2 in these proteins require only a single Zn ion [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3].OMG1 localizes to the nucleus The transient expression of a 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion protein in tobacco leaves indicates that OMG1 localizes in the nucleus. The highly conserved CCT domain in OMG1 has been associated with important functions in transcriptional regulation, DNA binding and nuclear localization (Robson et al. 2001; Yan et al. 2011; Gendron et al. 2012). Cells transformed with 35S::eGFP alone displayed a uniform expression of eGFP throughout the leaf pavement cells in the vacuoles, nucleus and membrane. However, cells transformed with 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion were specifically localized to the nucleus, as indicated by the DAPI nuclei-specific counter stain (Fig. 10). Figure 10. Open in a new tab OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain and localizes in the nucleus. (A) The sequence of CCT domain was compared between Arabidopsis COL11-12, OMG1 and the basal species Amborella trichopoda. OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain (consensus sequence in black) that encodes a nuclear localization signal (highlighted in red). (B) Subcellular localization using leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings that were transiently transformed with Agrobacterium-GV3101 carrying the At1g05290cds-eGFP fusion vector or the pCAMBIA1302 (as an overexpressing eGFP control) indicated that OMG1 is localized solely in the nucleus and exhibits no presence elsewhere in the cell. DAPI stains for the nucleus and can be seen to overlap with the eGFP expression. Scale bars: 100 µm.Discussion As sessile organisms, plants have developed sensitive, adaptive strategies to regulate their metabolism in a changing environment (Noctor et al. 2007; Schwarzländer and Finkemeier 2012). A strategy to avoid oxidative damage relies on the ability to deploy different antioxidants and ROS-scavenging/detoxifying enzymes to efficiently adjust their redox states. When subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight, plants respond by overexpressing more ROS- or redox-associated genes than comparable plants on the ground (Im et al. 2011; Paul et al. 2012b, 2013b, 2017; Correll et al. 2013; Sugimoto et al. 2014). ROS in its various forms and subcellular production sites can elicit distinct and diverse physiological, biochemical and molecular responses (Mittler et al. 2004; Gadjev et al. 2006; Swanson and Gilroy 2010; Suzuki et al. 2012). It is possible that plants drew from diverse ROS response strategies to cope with spaceflight, an environment that is outside their evolutionary experience and therefore potentially stressful. The data presented here suggest that OMG1 is a putative regulator of the ROS signalling pathway associated with wounding and may play a prominent role in regulating the spaceflight ROS response, especially in the WS ecotype where it is strongly induced by spaceflight. Spaceflight induces the differential expression of ROS-producing genes in an ecotype-dependent manner In general, the differentially expressed genes in spaceflight showed a positive correlation to genes producing ROS (Fig. 1A). Although it is known that ecotype differences can diversify the ROS signatures associated with stress responses on Earth (Kalbina and Strid 2006; Li et al. 2006, 2008), these results are the first to demonstrate that different ecotypes use different specific subcellular ROS species to respond to the spaceflight environment (Fig. 1). Previous morphological differences between Col-0 and WS ecotypes in the spaceflight environment were primarily observed in the roots. Although the overall root length at 11 days on orbit between the two ecotypes showed no significant difference (Paul et al. 2017), it was noted that the Col-0 ecotype showed a dramatic lag in root development during the first 48-h post-germination in orbit when compared to the WS ecotype, and that there are also ecotype-specific differences in root growth behaviour (Paul et al. 2012a). One difference between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes is the regulation of class III peroxidase genes (Passardi et al. 2007). In fact, two genes PE10 (AT1G49570) and PE59 (AT5G19890) that were up-regulated in the APEX03-2 Col-0 but remained unchanged in APEX03-2 WS (Fig. 1B) are involved in controlling the root cell elongation process (Markakis et al. 2012). The differentially expressed peroxidase genes between the two ecotypes in the APEX03-2 spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1B) reinforce the notion that different ecotypes utilize ROS differently to respond to their environment and suggest that in WS, these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged. In addition, the observed down-regulation of peroxidases in Col-0 was consonant with observations previously published (Kwon et al. 2015). Since peroxidases are necessary for the general oxidoreduction of H2O2 in general, the down-regulation of peroxidases in spaceflight within Col-0 could contribute to Col-0-specific ROS signatures seen in clusters A and B of the ROSMETER analyses (Fig. 1A). The current ROSMETER analysis is not intended to define how specific ecotypes utilize peroxidases or regulate specific ROS indices in response to spaceflight. Rather, it is to illustrate that the genetic background of the spaceflight-grown plant had a substantial impact on the specific subcellular ROS species that were used in the physiological response.OMG1 transcript is consistently up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments and is induced rapidly upon wounding in both WS and Col-0 OMG1 is consistently induced in spaceflight in WS but not Col-0. Comparisons of the 5′ upstream region, the coding region and the 3′ UTR of OMG1 between the two ecotypes showed no differences in the primary sequence. However, in the intergenic region downstream of the OMG1 stop codon, a point mutation is observed at positions 2197, 3327, and a two-nucleotide deletion is observed at position 3488 [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S4]. Wassilewskija and Col-0 do regulate OMG1 differently. OMG1 showed slight differences in basal expression between Col-0 and WS, and both ecotypes demonstrated immediate up-regulation of OMG1 after wounding, along with the rapid diminishing of the signal afterwards [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5A]. However, Col-0 and WS responded very differently in a wounding dosage test, where leaves were subjected to various degrees of damage at the onset of wounding (‘immediate’ time point) [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5B]. Irrespective of the extent of the wounded surface area of the leaf, Col-0 expressed OMG1 at a consistent level, whereas WS expressed OMG1 in a dose-response manner [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S5C]. These results suggest that OMG1 is involved in a rapid wounding response in both Col-0 and WS ecotypes but with different modes of regulation. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes are genotypically distinct, and their transcriptomic responses to environmental and developmental cues can be dissimilar (e.g. Chen et al. 2005; Kusunoki et al. 2017). The overall spaceflight transcriptomes of WS and Col-0 are dramatically different (Paul et al. 2017). It is hypothesized that even though OMG1 is functional in both ecotypes upon wounding, other gene products or pathways present in Col-0 but not WS could compensate for the ‘need’ for OMG1 in space, or that these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged in the spaceflight transcriptome. Although OMG1’s role in the physiological adaptation of WS to spaceflight has yet to be discerned, its strong induction suggests that OMG1 contributes to a successful adjustment to that environment. Irrespective of OMG1’s specific role in spaceflight physiology, it is noteworthy that OMG1’s overall metabolic function, which was previously unknown, was only discovered because of its role in spaceflight physiology.OMG1 is associated with the regulation of ROS OMG1 is associated with ROS regulation. The location of OMG1 promoter region activity coincided with regions of dynamic ROS activity. OMG1 specifically regulated the expression of two ROS-associated genes (GRX480 and MYB77). And, loss of OMG1 protein in omg1 resulted in deviations from WT in two different ROS assays. The rapid induction of OMG1 expression immediately after wounding was observed with a promoter-driven GUS reporter qRT-PCR analysis. Rapid induction of transcription (prior to 2-min post-stimulus) has been observed in gravitational and mechanical stimulation of Arabidopsis root apical tissues (Kimbrough et al. 2004). In addition, wounding Arabidopsis leaves produces ROS within minutes at the wound site (Miller et al. 2009; Beneloujaephajri et al. 2013) and this rapid response is necessary for plants to elicit immediate defence/repair mechanisms against herbivore and pathogen attacks. Wounded plants can transmit rapid RBOHD-dependent ROS signals of speeds up to 8.4 cm min−1 to mediate long-distance cell-to-cell communication (Miller et al. 2009). However, since no statistical differences were seen in the expression level of RbohD in Col-0 WT plants and omg1 KO plants (Fig. 6D), this suggests that the changes in extracellular or intracellular ROS are not a result of altered expression of RbohD in the omg1 KO line. Reactive oxygen species molecules are essential signalling molecules in plant growth and development but can also act as toxic stressors. Therefore, there exists an elaborate and highly redundant network of genes that maintain the delicate ROS homeostasis (Gechev et al. 2006). Functional OMG1 is necessary for rapid generation of intracellular ROS at the wound site (Fig. 6A and B). However, over time these ROS return to WT levels, presumably facilitated by other genes of redundant function [seeSupporting Information—Fig. S6]. In a recent review, it has been suggested that altered ROS signalling in response to the spaceflight environment could affect plant growth and development indirectly via changes in hormonal influx within the plants (Schüler et al. 2015). OMG1 was found to regulate the expression of ROS-associated genes GRX480 and MYB77. GRX480/GRXC9 is a member of the glutaredoxin (GRX) family of small redox enzymes. GRX480 is a salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene induced quickly and transiently by an NPR1-independent pathway, which is associated with the ROS-scavenging/antioxidant network (Laporte et al. 2012; Zander et al. 2012; Herrera-Vásquez et al. 2015a; Huang et al. 2016). MYB77 is a member of the R2R3-type transcription factor family that is involved in ROS metabolism through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade is also known to play a role in plant development and hormone signalling and includes hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), SA and ethylene (ET) (Shin and Schachtman 2004; Teige et al. 2004; Galvez-Valdivieso et al. 2009; Herrera-Vásquez et al. 2015b). OMG1’s role in ROS signalling was established with two frequently used ROS biochemical assays. The DCF-DA assay showed that intracellular ROS production around the wound site was dampened in the omg1 mutant, whereas flg22-induced extracellular ROS production was 20 % higher than WT in the omg1 mutant. These conflicting results can be addressed by the different signalling pathways elicited by each stimulus. Responses to mechanical damage can be localized, systemic or both. In any case, the response involves the generation, translocation, perception and transduction of wound signals to activate the expression of wound‐inducible genes. In response to mechanical wounding, the central role for JA signalling is well established. However, many other compounds, such as oligopeptide systemin, oligosaccharides, phytohormones, hydraulic pressure or electrical pulses, have also been proposed to play a role in wound signalling (León et al. 2001). Early localized ROS induced by wounding, specifically O2•−, H2O2 and singlet oxygen, have been suggested to originate intracellularly from the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts (Morker and Roberts 2011). On the other hand, flg22, a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), elicits an early response that includes SA-, JA- and ET-defence signalling pathways. Flg22 also elicits a late response that includes activation of defence-related senescence processes, SA-dependent secretory pathway genes and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) expression (Denoux et al. 2008). MAMP-induced ROS have been shown to originate from the apoplast through activation of NADPH oxidases as well as peroxidases (Jwa and Hwang 2017). Although there are crosstalks between signalling pathways induced by mechanical wounding and flg22, there are also unique pathways induced by each stimulus that could attribute to the different results observed. Details of these mechanisms are still being investigated; however, the results infer that within the Brassicaceae family OMG1 does play a role in the ROS signalling pathway.Phylogeny and protein architecture of OMG1 Prior to this study, members of the Arabidopsis CO and COL family were thought to only function in photoperiod signalling that involves flowering, circadian rhythms, stomata opening and root-shoot branching (Gangappa and Botto 2014). Evidence presented here suggests that members of this family play a role in ROS signalling. This, in turn, could aid in the functional characterization of many of the other uncharacterized members such as COL11 and COL12. We suggest that divergent function of OMG1 can be attributed to the evolved B-box1 and B-box2 domains. This is in line with reports on the rapid evolution of COL genes within the Brassicaceae, in which the increased evolutionary rates were observed not only in the middle region of the protein but also in the conserved zinc-finger and basic CCT regions (Lagercrantz and Axelsson 2000).Conclusion OMG1 is a CCT domain transcriptional regulator of ROS homeostasis, one that is important to the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis ecotype WS to spaceflight. While investigations are underway to determine the detailed mechanisms of how OMG1 regulates the ROS homeostasis in wounding, and its specific role in spaceflight, the results presented here demonstrate several important concepts for general consideration. First, spaceflight experiments are useful platforms to discover novel gene functions and provide fundamental insights into terrestrial plant biology. Second, the response to spaceflight is genotype-specific and this understanding should be taken into consideration when defining the overall plant spaceflight response. WS and Col-0 differ in induction of OMG1 in spaceflight. Third, the maintenance of ROS homeostasis plays an important role as plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight. And, last, the CONSTANS-Like family contains members that function well beyond the clock and timing roles typically associated with CCT domains, including ROS signalling.Sources of Funding This work was supported by NASA - Space Life and Physical Sciences (NNX09AL96G, NNX07AH270, NNX12AN69G and NNX14AT24G awarded to R.J.F. and A.-L.P.).Contributions by the Authors N.J.S. designed and conducted the ROS and OMG1-related experiments, analysed the transcriptome data, and wrote the first drafts of the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation. Keywords: spaceflight, Arabidopsis, plant cell culture, undifferentiated cells, microgravity, heat shock",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Survival in a challenging environment requires a coordinated system that enables a living organism to respond appropriately to a change. The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants [1,2] and with specific assays of expression [3,4,5,6,7]. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments [8,9,10,11]. Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Even unicellular plants are capable of sensing a change in the gravitational environment and there have been several spaceflight experiments that examine the transcriptomes of single plant cells, and undifferentiated plants cells, which also lack traditional gravity-sensing organs [4,19,25,26,27,28]. The wealth of information on the transcriptional changes that accompany the adjustments to spaceflight begins to suggest common strategies for adjusting to the spaceflight environment; however, the underlying question of why certain genes are necessary remains unanswered. One group of genes strongly represented in many spaceflight transcriptomes is composed of the heat shock transcription factors and proteins that comprise the Heat Shock Factor network [15,19]. Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes in response to almost any environmental stress and are essential to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms (for review, please see [29]). HSF genes are evolutionarily conserved and are represented in the genomes of almost every organism. Given the conservation of the HSF network and its general roles in stress responses, it was perhaps not surprising to see HSFs represented in the response to spaceflight in plants. Their particularly strong representation in cell cultures; however, suggested HSFs could play a unique role in the spaceflight response of undifferentiated cells [4]. One hallmark of cellular stress is the accumulation of denatured proteins. The main gene targets of HSF-induced transcriptional activation are the stress response proteins that act as molecular chaperones [29,30,31,32]. These chaperones not only protect a cell from denatured protein accumulation, but also assure proper protein folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins indispensable in response to stress. The Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the main chaperones of the folding machinery, but there are also other non-chaperone proteins assisting in efficient protein maturation [33,34,35]. For instance, a pair of enzymes, including a disulfide carrier protein (protein disulfide isomerase, PDI), and a disulfide-generating enzyme (endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1, ERO1 and protein disulfide isomerase, PDI, PDIs/ERO1) catalyze oxidative protein folding by creating disulfide bonds, thereby assisting in proper protein sorting [36,37]. Protein folding occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also serves as the main hub for the secretory pathways and protein delivery to their final destinations. The ER uses an extensive surveillance called the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) system, which assures that only properly folded proteins exit the ER and maintains proper physiological homeostasis in the ER [38]. When there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a stress signal is emitted. Initially, a cell activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) intended to increase the ER folding capacity in an attempt to refold the aberrant proteins [39,40]. If these UPR solutions to the unfolded protein accumulation problem fail, or if the accumulation of misfolded proteins is massive, then the final UPR step—the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)—is activated. The ERAD eliminates and destroys the misfolded proteins via proteasome digestion, preventing further protein aggregation. The luminal lectin OS9 in cooperation with a membrane spanning protein SEL1/HRD3 recognizes the unfolded glycosylated proteins which are then ubiquitinylated by the HRD1 E3 ligase, removed from the ER lumen, and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytoplasm [41,42]. Taken collectively, ER homeostasis works as a sensor for environmental stimuli, and the ER stress signal initiates a subcellular stress response system that can secure protein homeostasis during environmental changes [43,44]. The HsfA2 gene is a member of the large family of Hsf genes in the HSF network and is a key regulator of the defense response via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation to several types of environmental stresses, namely extreme temperatures (high and low), hydrogen peroxide, and high light intensity [45,46,47]. The HSFA2 protein has been demonstrated itself to be the main coordinator of the UPR during heat stress [48]. The critical involvement of HSFA2 in the response to extreme environments makes it an excellent target candidate for studying the effects of spaceflight on plants and to test if plants use the same universal stress response mechanism evolved terrestrially to accommodate the novel space gravitational environment. HSFA2 may also have an additional role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment beyond the UPR induction of the chaperone-based protein folding machinery. The genes encoding HSFs and HSPs were reported to be upregulated in spaceflight in many biological systems [26,49]. The HsfA2 gene specifically was the highest upregulated gene in the wild type Arabidopsis cell cultures after 12 days in space [4,19]. Moreover, HSFA2 was shown to function in amplification of the signal in response to brassinosteroids, calcium, and auxin and was reported to be affected in Arabidopsis in spaceflight, and therefore has the potential for playing a role in the gravity sensing signal transduction cascade [13,20,50]. In the unicellular yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the HSF targets represent nearly 3% of the genome and the diversity of their functions supports a broad role for HSF in coordinating the multitude of cellular processes occurring in normal and stressful conditions [51]. Since the HSFs play a role in various cellular processes such as development, cellular lifespan, cell differentiation and proliferation, the likelihood that HSFA2 will play some role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight increases [52,53]. Cell lines from wild type (WT) Col-0 and an HsfA2 knockout (HSFA2 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Cannisters 17 (BRIC17) payload. The experiments here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to samples grown on the ground. Descriptions and discussions will consider not only the spaceflight adaptation experience for each genotype, but also the gene expression profiles in the ground and spaceflight environments between genotypes. It was our goal to develop a better understanding of how cells, disabled in a primary regulator of environmental stress response, react to an unfamiliar environment outside of their evolutionary experience. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding not only of HSFA2’s role in adjusting to novel environments, but also the broader scope of the processes involved spaceflight physiological adaptation in plant cells.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. The CEL Experiment of BRIC17 For details on the CEL experiment of BRIC17, please see [28], and Figure 1, which provides images of the BRIC Hardware and cells used in these analyses. Briefly, the CEL BRIC17 experiment was launched in the Dragon capsule of SpaceX-3 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on the 1st of March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware. The PDFU/BRIC system is a passive, air-tight, non-ventilated, non-illuminated culture system. The BRIC system is certainly not an optimal habitat for plant growth, and its limitations have been reviewed [16,110]. However, the BRIC habitat is less inimical to undifferentiated cell cultures than for photosynthetic seedlings. In addition, both spaceflight and ground control cells were each exposed to the limitations of the BRIC hardware. The spaceflight samples were launched to the ISS, while the ground controls were “launched” on a 48-h delay, and then maintained in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The 48-h delay facilitated the downlink of ISS environmental data for programming the ISSES chamber. The downlinked data included environmental conditions on the ISS that were duplicated in the ISSES. Cells were fixed within the BRIC canisters on the ISS with RNAlaterTM (Ambion) on the 10th day in orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. Twenty-four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) until the spaceflight samples were transported back to Earth, and the ground control samples were transferred to a standard laboratory −80 °C freezer. The total RNA was extracted from the spaceflight samples and the corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays. 4.2. Tissue Culture Cell Lines Arabidopsis callus cultures were established de novo, and each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were then transferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), and 2,4-D (0.5 mL/L) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lines, each of Col-0 ecotype, were the subjects of this study: wild type (WT), and a knockout line generated from the HsfA2 T-DNA insertion (SALK_008978C) (HSFA2 KO). The SALK line was obtained through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), (www.arabidopsis.org) [111]. 4.3. Preparation of BRIC17 CEL Cell Culture Plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were transferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 6.5 mL nutrient agar media (MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)). The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to assure sterility of both the interior and exterior of plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and then driven to KSC. The BRIC17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time. 4.4. RNA Extractions Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.5. Microarrays cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) and labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.,Redwood City, CA, USA). Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 µg/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceflight and ground control, 5 plates of WT and 3 plates of HSFA2 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 4.5.1. Microarray Data Analysis Affymetrix® Expression Console™ Software (Version 1.3) was used to generate. CEL files for each RNA hybridization. All analysis was performed in R 3.0.0 [112]. Background adjustment, summarization, and quantile normalization were performed using Limma package [113]. Normalization was made using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 normalization algorithm [114]. Data quality was assessed using the arrayQualityMetrics package and various QC charts (Density and Intensity plot, NUSE, RLE, and RNA Degradation Plot). Probes that had signals absent in all samples were removed. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from spaceflight samples was compared to the probe-set signal value of ground control samples to give gene expression ratios. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Limma package with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed with stringent criteria at P-value < 0.01, abs Fold Change > 2 (−1< FC log2 > +1; labeled as log2 Fold Change) unless stated otherwise.4.5.2. Comparison Groups The groups outlined in the concept of operations and comparisons were established and abbreviated with a combination of two capital letters and a short version of the cell line name in superscript (see Figure 2A). Letters: G—Ground Control, F—Spaceflight; Superscripts: Wt—WT cells, Hsf—HSFA2 KO cells. 4.6. Functional Gene Categorization—Gene Ontology Annotations Gene function was annotated by associations of controlled vocabularies or keywords to data objects (Gene Ontology, GO). Multiple GO toolkits of this controlled vocabulary system were used to collect annotations of gene function. Various lists of gene names were created, and enrichment GO terms were searched after statistical test from pre-calculated backgrounds. All three aspects of gene products (molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location) described by GO controlled vocabularies were considered. A significance level of 0.05 and five genes as minimum number of mapping entries were implemented for the analysis parameters in the following tools: AgriGO—An integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community AgriGO was used [115]. AgriGO query criteria were as follows: Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Arabidopsis genemodel (TAIR9) precomputed background, Fisher was selected as the statistical test method of choice with the NOT-adjust multi-test adjustment method; significance level was set at 0.01 or 0.05, minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 5, plant GO slim was selected from other Gene ontology types. For Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE), the selected species was Arabidopsis thaliana, NOT-adjust was selected for multi-test adjustment method, significance level was set at 0.1, minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 10, and Plant GO slim was selected from other Gene ontology types. AmiGO—If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II—The ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes, developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabidopsis, was also used [116]. The make gene function table function was implemented to retrieve organized information on gene function (based on TAIR annotation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProfiler—A web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists was used [117]. Arabidopsis thaliana was the selected organism with most of default options except where the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR significance threshold was selected.",
    "results": "2. Results In this experiment, the pattern of gene expression that defined the adapted state was established after ten days of growth in the BRIC hardware in two environments: spaceflight, and ground control in the two genotypes: HSFA2 KO, and WT. Cell clusters of both genotypes were applied in comparable density for both treatments, and continued growth in the spaceflight and ground control environments (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Microarray gene expression data were analyzed in two dimensions. The first or “vertical” dimension of the analysis involved the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of the cells grown in spaceflight to those grown on the ground for each of the two cell lines (see red box in Figure 2A, and refer also to [28] for a similar experimental design). For clarity, this vertical comparison was termed the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment of either HSFA2 KO or WT cells. Genes identified in this vertical comparison contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to spaceflight in each genotype. The second or “horizontal” dimension of the analysis involved comparison of gene expression profiles between the two genotypes within the same environment: ground (see green box of Figure 2A) and spaceflight (see blue box of Figure 2A). In the ground horizontal comparison, gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground was compared to gene expression in WT cells on the ground, thus defining unique genes of the ground adapted state for each genotype. Similarly, in a spaceflight horizontal comparison, the gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight was compared to gene expression in WT cells in spaceflight, thus defining unique genes required for the spaceflight adapted state in each genotype. Finally, the sets of genes obtained from a comparison of the first and second dimension were analyzed together, and their interdependence was examined. Figure 2.

Blue box and arrow indicate part of the second dimension of data analysis—a comparison of gene expression profiles between the two genotypes during spaceflight-adapted state, thereby defining the genes uniquely required by the two genotypes for spaceflight-adapted state; (B) A proportional graphical presentation of the significantly differentially expressed genes identified in each comparison group: 78 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWT; 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf; 349 genes of the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group; 220 genes of the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt. The gene expression datasets were abbreviated as follows: Ground Control WT (GWt), Ground Control HSFA2 KO (GHsf), Spaceflight WT (FWt) and Spaceflight HSFA2 KO (FHsf). The WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FWt : GWt comparison group (see red box on the left in Figure 2A), the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FHsf : GHsf comparison group (red box on the right in Figure 2A), the genotypic adaptation to ground was identified in the GHsf : GWt comparison group (see green box at the bottom in Figure 2A), and the genotypic adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FHsf : FWt comparison group (blue box on top in Figure 2A). The genes that were differentially expressed in these comparisons are outlined in the following sections in terms of the numbers of differentially expressed genes represented in general ontology categories. Full annotations of the genes in each category are presented in Appendix A Table A1 and Table A2. 2.1. The HsfA2 Expression Levels across Samples The raw gene expression values in microarrays, measured as a fluorescence signal intensity, showed that the HsfA2 transcript was abundant in the WT undifferentiated cells in the ground control samples. The average raw expression of the HsfA2 gene in the 4 biological replicates of the WT ground control cells was 4171 (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material). In contrast, the average raw HsfA2 gene expression in the 3 biological replicates of the HSFA2 KO ground control cells was only 39. Thus, there was a deficit of −7.27 log2 Fold Change (P-value 2.9 × 10−9) of the HsfA2 transcript in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells on the ground, demonstrating that the T-DNA insertion mutation severely depressed HsfA2 expression. There was no statistically significant difference in the HsfA2 expression levels between spaceflight and corresponding ground control for either the WT cells or the HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material). 2.2. Different Genes Characterize the Physiological Adaptation of the WT and HSFA2 KO Cells to Spaceflight 2.2.1. The Genes Characterizing the Physiological Adaptation of WT Cells to Spaceflight—FWt : GWt The genes involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in WT spaceflight cells (FWt) to the WT ground control cells (GWt) in the FWt : GWt group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 46 genes were upregulated and 32 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 3, File S1 GO 78 FWtGWt in the Supplementary Material). The microarray data are publicly available from GEO (GSE95388) and GeneLab (number TBD). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 78 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from the FWt : GWt group comparison, and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from the FHsf : GHsf group comparison.The upregulated genes identified from the FWt : GWt group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under two GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and regulation of biological processes (GO:0050789). Many of these genes are associated with defense, wounding, and cell wall metabolism (Table A1). The downregulated genes identified from FWt : GWt group comparison represented genes that were downregulated in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under the regulation of biological process GO term (GO:0050789) and under the categories of endomembrane systems (GO:0012505) and Golgi associated (GO:0005794). Many of these genes are associated with cellular transport and receptors (Table A1).2.2.2. HSFA2 KO Cells Changed the Expression of Three Times More Genes than Seen in WT Cells—FHsf : GHsf The genes involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells (FHsf) to HSFA2 KO ground control cells (GHsf) in the FHsf : GHsf group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 221 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 112 genes were upregulated, and 109 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 3, File S2 GO 221 FHsfGHsf in the Supplementary Material). The upregulated genes identified from FHsf : GHsf group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of biological process ontology: the defense response genes to other organism (GO:0098542), including response to wounding, cellular response to sucrose starvation (GO:0043617) and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation (GO:0009083) (see Table A1). The downregulated genes identified from FHsf : GHsf group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 2 GO terms of biological process ontology: closely related growth, developmental process (GO:0032502) and anatomical structure morphogenesis (GO:0009653), particularly those involved in cell elongation, cell wall loosening, and multidimensional cell growth. These downregulated genes also fell under 2 GO terms of the cellular component ontology: plant-type cell wall (GO:0009505) and plasma membrane (GO:0005886) (see Table A1). 2.3. WT and HSFA2 KO Show More Difference in Gene Expression Profiles in Their Ground-Adapted State than in Spaceflight-Adapted State 2.3.1. Genotype Specific Genes of the Ground-Adapted State—GHsf : GWt Comparison of the gene expression profiles of the ground-adapted states between the HSFA2 KO and WT cells shows the consequences of the HsfA2 gene loss for cells in the ground environment. The genes differentially expressed in the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO ground cells (GHsf) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the GHsf : GWt group comparison (see Figure 2). There were 349 genes significantly differentially expressed between WT and HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 115 genes were upregulated and 234 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 4, File S3 GO 349 GHsfGWt in the Supplementary Material). Genotypes in ground-adapted state displayed the greatest differences in gene expression profiles than in any other comparison group. Thirty-three percent of genes had an enhanced expression in the ground-adapted state in HSFA2 KO cells compared to WT cells, and 67% had diminished expression (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 349 genes of the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group comparison and 220 genes of the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group comparison.In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the upregulated genes identified from the GHsf : GWt group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and defense response to other organism (GO:0098542), particularly to: nematode, fungus, bacterium and to wounding, water deprivation (GO:0009414) related to high salinity, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) (GO:0034976) and unfolded protein response (UPR) (GO:0006986) and response to misfolded protein (GO:0051788), localization (GO:0051179), transport (GO:0006810), establishment of localization (GO:0051234) (see Table A2). In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the GHsf : GWt group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and response to stress (GO:0006950), including chaperones and non-chaperones, response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979), response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0000302), response to hydrogen peroxide (GO:0042542), response to sucrose stimulus (GO:0009744) and cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process (GO:0006519), such as biosynthesis of phenylalanine, asparagine, tryptophan and flavonoid (see Table A2). 2.3.2. Genotype Specific Genes of the Spaceflight-Adapted State—FHsf : FWt A comparison of the gene expression profiles of spaceflight-adapted states between the HSFA2 KO and WT cells shows cells’ adaptation to spaceflight environment if the HSFA2 function was disabled. Thus, these genes indicate the genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. The genes differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells (FHsf) to WT spaceflight cells (FWt) in the FHsf : FWt group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 220 genes significantly differentially expressed between HSFA2 KO and WT cell samples in spaceflight (see Figure 2B, Figure 4, File S4 GO 220 FHsfFWt in the Supplementary Material). The 95 genes were more highly expressed in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells in spaceflight, while 125 genes were downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells as compared to WT cells in spaceflight. In the HSFA2 KO and WT spaceflight-adapted state, the upregulated genes identified from the FHsf : FWt group comparison, represented genes that were overexpressed in cells disabled in HsfA2 in spaceflight compared to WT cells in spaceflight. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: defense response to other organism (GO:0098542), response to topologically incorrect protein (GO:0035966), response to unfolded protein (UPR) (GO:0006986) and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (GO:0036503), as well as protein localization (GO:0008104), establishment of protein localization (GO:0045184), protein transport (GO:0015031), vesicle-mediated transport (GO:0016192), transport (GO:0006810), establishment of localization (GO:0051234), including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and secondary metabolic process (GO:0019748) (see Table A2). Additionally, these upregulated genes represented plasma membrane GO term (GO:0005886) including plasma membrane receptor kinases of the cellular component ontology (see Table A2). In the HSFA2 KO and WT spaceflight-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the FHsf : FWt group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled in HsfA2 in spaceflight compared to WT cells in spaceflight. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of cellular compartment ontology: cell wall (GO:0005618), external encapsulating structure (GO:0030312) including xylem development, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, plastid (GO:0009536) and energy reserve metabolic process (GO:0006112) including starch biosynthetic process (GO:0019252) (see Table A2). 2.4. Occurrence of Individual Genes and Gene Function Across Collective Comparisons of Physiological Adaptation, Ground and Spaceflight-Adapted States 2.4.1. In the Response to Spaceflight, There Were Only Four Differentially Expressed Genes Represented in Both the WT and HSFA2 KO Comparisons (FWt : GWt to FHsf : GHsf) When the 78 differentially expressed genes in the FWt : GWt group comparison were compared to the 221 genes differentially expressed in the FHsf : GHsf group comparison, only one gene changed in the exact same way, At2g03760, which encodes a putative steroid sulfotransferase (see Figure 3, Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). At2g03760 was upregulated in spaceflight cells relative to their ground counterparts in both cell lines. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The heat map visualization of the selected significantly differentially expressed genes arranged by a specific expression patterns in the four comparison groups FWt : GWt, FHsf : GHsf, GHsf : GWt, FHsf : FWt. A through F designate a category for respective expression pattern. (A) genes were selected by presence among the physiological adaptation genes: 4 genes shared by the 78 of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt group comparison and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf group comparison; (B) genes were selected by presence among the ground and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 28 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group and in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt; (C) genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 10 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt comparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group. These genes were categorized as Required; (D) Genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 66 genes that showed opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf comparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group. These genes were categorized as Corrected; (E) Genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 7 genes that showed the opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt comparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group. These genes were categorized as HsfA2-dependent. In addition, reflect WT genotypic adaptation; (F) genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 53 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf comparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group. These genes were categorized as Compensated, and reflect HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation.Two of the genes differentially expressed in spaceflight for both HSFA2 KO and WT cells were expressed in opposite directions. During spaceflight, these genes were upregulated in WT cells, while being down regulated HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). These genes were: At3g10400-RNA recognition motif, and CCHC-type zinc finger domain containing protein and At4g03570-Cystatin/monellin superfamily protein. However, these two genes showed significant differential expressions in ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, being overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells. The genes were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells. Therefore, although the genes seemed to be engaged conversely in the physiological adaptation in two cell lines, their expression adjustments in either HSFA2 KO or WT cells resulted in no different expression level in spaceflight-adapted state. The differential expression level on the ground caused HSFA2 KO cells to diminish the expression of these genes, and WT cells to increase in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. One additional gene was expressed in opposite directions in response to spaceflight. At4g02460-PMS1 DNA mismatch repair protein was upregulated in WT and downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material).2.4.2. Only 28 Genes Differentially Expressed Between the Two Genotypes in the Ground-Adapted State were also Differentially Expressed in the Spaceflight-Adapted State (GHsf : GWt to FHsf : FWt) When the 349 genes differentially expressed in the GHsf : GWt group comparison were juxtaposed to the 220 genes of differentially expressed in the FHsf : FWt group comparison, only 28 genes showed the same differential expression (see Figure 4, Figure 5B). Among these genes were those representing response to toxic substance ontology (At2g29490-ATGSTU1 glutathione S-transferase tau 1, At2g29470-ATGSTU3 glutathione S-transferase tau 3, At1g17170-ATGSTU24 glutathione S-transferase tau 24), and transport, establishment of localization, and localization (At3g44340-CEF ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, At1g29310-SecY protein transport family protein, At1g78570-RHM1 RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS 1 dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, At1g71140-MATE efflux family protein, At5g54860-Major facilitator superfamily protein).2.4.3. Required and Corrected Genes for the Spaceflight-Adapted State Some genes differentially expressed in the ground-adapted state between WT and HSFA2 KO were involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT or HSFA2 KO cells. The differential expression of the 349 genes expressed in the ground-adapted state, the GHsf : GWt group comparison, was assessed in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt : GWt comparison group, and in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf : GHsf comparison group. If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the WT cells but not of HSFA2 KO cells, then it was defined as required. For a gene to be required it had to meet these criteria: WT cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. WT cells differentially expressed the gene on the ground compared to HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. HSFA2 KO cells did not change the gene’s expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in WT spaceflight was similar to the expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight. Therefore, required genes are those whose expression levels in WT cells in spaceflight match the expression in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight. HSFA2 KO cells already have the space-adapted expression level. There were 10 genes that met these criteria (see Figure 5C, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the HSFA2 KO cells but not of the WT cells, then it was defined as corrected. For a gene to be classified as corrected it needed to meet these criteria: HSFA2 KO cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. HSFA2 KO cells differentially expressed the corrected gene on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. WT cells did not change the corrected gene expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight is similar to the expression level of the gene in WT in spaceflight. Therefore, corrected genes are those whose expression levels in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight match the WT expression levels in spaceflight. These are genes that HSFA2 KO differentially expressed to match WT levels in order to adapt to spaceflight. These genes would not be revealed in an examination of WT cells alone. There were 66 genes that met these criteria (see Figure 5D, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). Thus, these 66 genes were considered to be corrected in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their expression levels were returned to WT levels in order adapt to spaceflight. Only 5 genes out of 66 were overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground relative to WT cell on the ground and thus were downregulated in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight to even the WT expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. The 61 genes showed diminished expression on the ground in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells on the ground, but were upregulated during spaceflight to match the WT expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. These 5 genes included: At3g44800-Meprin and TRAF (MATH) homology domain-containing protein of unknown function, At5g52260-myb19 a transcription factor, At2g35340-MEE29 maternal effect embryo arrest 29, At2g46960-CYP709B1 cytochrome P450 functioning in oxidation-reduction processes, and At5g15350-ENODL17 early nodulin-like protein 17 associated with cell wall pectin metabolic process. The 61 genes included genes associated with: response to wounding, mechanical stress, cell wall, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, as well as transmembrane transporter and nitrate transporters genes (see Appendix A Table A3).2.4.4. Genotypic-Specific Spaceflight-Adapted State A comparison of the spaceflight gene expression patterns between the two genotypes revealed 220 differentially expressed genes between WT and HSFA2 KO. The expression of these 220 differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state (FHsf : FWt) was compared to the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt : GWt comparison group, and the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf : GHsf comparison group. HsfA2-Dependent Genes in the WT Genotypic Spaceflight Adaptation In the vertical comparison between spaceflight and ground gene expression patterns, there were 7 genes differentially expressed in WT that were not differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO cells. These genes were not differentially expressed between WT and HSFA2 KO in the ground-adapted state, but were differentially expressed between genotypes in the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5E, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). Thus, these genes were HsfA2-dependent, as they were adapted to the spaceflight level only if the HsfA2 gene was functional. These genes represent the WT genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. All genes but one (At4g07960-ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase-like C12 localized to Golgi apparatus, plasmodesma), were downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation and resulted in the higher expression in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO than in WT cells. These 6 genes were: At5g19070-SNARE associated Golgi protein family involved in proline transport and localized to plasma membrane, At1g78980-SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 functioning in transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and localized to extracellular region, two genes, At1g66640-RNI-like superfamily protein and At2g36560-AT hook motif DNA-binding family protein, localized to nucleus, and At2g43240-Nucleotide-sugar transporter and At1g32830-transposable element gene (see Table A3). Compensated Genes for Disabled HsfA2 in the HSFA2 KO Spaceflight Adaptation In the vertical comparison of gene expression patterns between spaceflight and ground controls for WT and HSFA2 KO cells, there were 53 genes differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO that were not differentially expressed in WT. As with the HsfA2-dependent genes described above, these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the ground-adapted state, but were differentially expressed between genotypes in the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5F, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). These 53 genes were differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state because HSFA2 KO cells engaged these genes in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, while the WT cells did not. Thus, these genes compensated for the lack of functional HsfA2 gene. These genes represent the HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. There were 6 genes out of the 53 which were upregulated in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in the higher expression level in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells. These genes were associated with ER stress, UPR and vesicle-mediated transport (see Table A3). The remaining 49 genes were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and exhibited diminished expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells. These genes included genes associated with intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and calcium pump (see Table A3).",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Undifferentiated Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures were flown to the ISS as part of the BRIC17 CEL experiment to enhance the understanding of how cells lacking HSFA2, a key transcription factor involved in the response to terrestrial stress stimuli, physiologically adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. The WT cells and the cells disabled in expression of the HsfA2 gene both survived their orbits in the ISS, indicating that they both had adapted their physiology to the novel environment despite their genotypic differences. Cells disabled in HSFA2 function used substantially more and substantially different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation leads to a remarkable conclusion about the role of the HSF network in the entire adaptation processes to spaceflight—proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network. This conclusion suggests that various aspects of HSFA2 and the HSF network illuminate important components of spaceflight adaptation in plant cells. 3.1. Universal and Specific Aspects of the HSFA2 Role in the Adaptation to Spaceflight Inevitably, the physiological adaptation to a change in the environment, including the novel change of ground to spaceflight, requires de novo protein synthesis followed by protein maturation and transport. Therefore, when a population of cells transitions to the spaceflight environment, the demands on a cell to synthesize and mature new proteins manifests in a unique manner. Unlike WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells activated the UPR as part of a strategy to adapt to spaceflight, implicating that the ability to fold proteins adequately was compromised in the HSFA2 KO cells. As previously observed at the molecular level in response to a multitude of other environmental stimuli, HSFA2 was likely working to secure cellular protein homeostasis, and the inefficiency in protein folding observed in space flown HSFA2 KO cells likely resulted from the limited HSFA2-governed regulation of molecular chaperone genes. For instance, the PDI gene, ATPDIL2-3 (At2g32920), the transcription factors WRKY33 (At2g38470), and AtGATA-1 (At3g24050) along with four other genes (Ypt/Rab-GAP domain of gyp1p superfamily protein (At3g49350), SAG21 (At4g02380), transmembrane proteins 14c (At1g50740), and unknown (At1g19020)), all of which were reported to be a part of the UPR, were uniquely abundant in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight [40]. Moreover, the pivotal gene of the ERAD, HRD3A (At1g18260), also showed enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight conditions, demonstrating activation of the destruction pathway for aberrant proteins. These results cumulatively suggest that the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight suffered from excessive aggregation of misfolded proteins and that to get rid of these misfolded and cumbersome aggregates, a degradation pathway was upregulated in order to actively remove them. Additionally, the genes of intracellular protein transport and secretion, such as Transducin/WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein (AT1G18830) alias SEC31-like protein transporter, target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (AT1G29060) and the Coatomer beta subunit (AT3G15980), which functions specifically in ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, were also upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in the spaceflight-adapted state [54]. The ATARFA1D (AT1G70490) gene coding Ras-related small GTP-binding family protein, known to be essential for vesicle coating and un-coating [55], was also upregulated in space-flown HSFA2 KO cells. This suggests that the protein sorting and delivery processes were impaired in space flown HSFA2 KO cells and that the over-induction of multiple vesicle-mediated protein transport genes was an attempt to circumvent an inefficient system of intracellular protein trafficking. As such, HSFA2 plays a role in processes involved when a cell physiologically adapts to spaceflight similar to its role as a universal coordinator of the stress response when plants adapt to a broad range of other environmental changes (see Figure 6). However, the expression patterns in the spaceflight-adapted state of the genes related to cell wall construction, signal transduction and starch biosynthesis in HSFA2 KO cells in comparison to WT cells imply more specific roles for HSFA2 beyond the universal stress response coordination. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Graphical presentation of the identified processes associated with the universal stress response and specific roles of HSFA2 in spaceflight. The filled shapes represent the biological process; the unfilled shapes represent the genes; red color indicates upregulation/enhancement; blue color represents downregulation/decrease. Text in bold highlights the key specific functions.The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight likely have a fundamentally different architecture from the wild type cell wall, along with diminished processes of cell growth, expansion, and elongation as identified by the altered gene expression profiles. Many genes encoding proteins important to these processes are downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. For instance, the gene coding glycosyltransferase QUA1 (At3g25140), involved in homogalacturonan biosynthesis and cell adhesion, the trichome birefringence-like 45 (TBL45 (At2g30010)), which functions in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, and XTH4 (AT2G06850), which executes the cleavage and reconnection of cell wall xyloglucan cross-links. It was shown for many plant systems that spaceflight caused changes to the cell wall organization; thus, the finding of this study suggests that HSFA2 may have a role in the way a plant cell remodels its wall to adapt to spaceflight microgravity [14,16,20]. Given that cells deficient in HsfA2 expression show signs of ER stress and impaired protein sorting and intracellular protein trafficking, it is possible that the proteins of the cell wall biosynthesis do not properly mature within ER, and thus fail to be properly sorted or delivered to their destination at the cell wall periphery [56,57]. However, the heat shock transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsf1, was shown to regulate cell wall remodeling in response to heat shock in a more specific fashion [58]. The yeast strain mutated in Hsf1 exhibited cell wall integrity defects in the absence of stress and Hsf1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of a set of proteins that are involved in cell wall formation and remodeling besides the universal regulation of the HSPs’ expression. The overexpression of a heat shock protein Hsp150 in S. cerevisiae caused upregulation of many cell wall proteins, leading to increased cell wall integrity and potentially enhanced the yeasts’ virulence [59]. Also, the Hsf genes were found among regulatory pathways in secondary cell wall thickening in Medicago truncatula using microarrays [60]. These examples further support HSFA2’s specific role in the remodeling of Arabidopsis cell wall architecture in the spaceflight environment. Another category of genes that suggested cell wall related roles for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation were the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes associated with wounding (see Section 2.3.2, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material). For instance, in spaceflight, HSFA2 KO cells overexpressed genes associated with glucosinolate biosynthesis (NSP5 nitrile specifier protein 5, At5g48180) and AOP1 (2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, At4g03070), in anthocyanin and flavinol biosynthesis (SRG1 senescence-related gene 1, At1g17020). These genes, and others in this category of herbivore response genes, were all overexpressed in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT spaceflight cells (horizontal comparison) [61,62,63]. The upregulation of these categories of genes suggests that the cells disabled in HsfA2 responded as they would to an herbivore attack, possibly as a consequence of diminished expression of cell wall remodeling genes, resulting in a thinning of the cell wall in spaceflight-adapted cells. The analysis of genes with differentially expressed spaceflight vs. ground control (vertical dimension) of the WT and HSFA2 KO cells further supports the concept that the cell wall remodeling is part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, and that HSFA2 has a central role in this process. Both cell genotypes engaged the cell wall remodeling genes in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight but with fundamentally different outcomes: the WT cells increased the expression of these genes, while the HSFA2 KO cells reduced its expression of cell wall-related genes in spaceflight relative to their terrestrially grown counterparts (see Section 2.2.1 and Section 2.2.2, Table A1, Figure 6). The WT cells enhanced the expression of a curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein (AT1G78860) that was previously identified among the secretory cell wall N-glycosylated proteins in a wall-bound extracellular matrix fraction during citrus pathogen invasion [64] and is described to be associated with cell wall structural changes and signaling upon biological attack. Also overexpressed in WT cells was an unknown protein (At4g30500) linked to the cellulose biosynthetic process and subtilase (AT1G30600), which exhibits serine-type endopeptidase activity that processes the precursor proteins of the cell wall pectin modification enzymes [65]. Contrary to WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells mostly downregulated the expression of multiple cell wall remodeling genes previously reported to be enhanced in spaceflight [14]. In spaceflight, cells in which HsfA2 was knocked out had diminished expression of cell wall loosening and cell wall elongation genes such as GASA1 (AT1G75750), endoxyloglucan transferase XTH4 (AT2G06850), EXPL1 (AT3G45970), and EXO (AT4G08950), relative to the ground control. These cells also decreased the expression level of genes associated with cell wall composition such as PMR6 (AT3G54920), which was shown to alter the composition of plant cell wall in resistance to powdery mildew pathogen, and Glycosyl hydrolase (AT5G13980), a gene shown to degrade cell wall polysaccharides [66,67]. Cell wall remodeling genes associated with developmental processes and genes related to the morphogenesis of anatomical structures also showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to its ground counterparts (see Section 2.2.2, Figure S4 drawing on the Left in the Supplementary Material). For instance, genes involved in cell elongation due to cell wall expansion such as GASA1 (At1g75750), EXLA1 (expansin-like A1, At3g45970), and GRH1 (At4g03190), a GRAS family transcription factor SCR (SCARECROW, At3g54220), which functions in asymmetric cell division, and auxin efflux carrier PIN1 (At1g73590), which is involved in the regulation of cell size, were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells that had physiologically adapted to spaceflight (see Table A1, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material) [68,69]. Additionally, 3 genes related to pollen development: 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily protein (At3g63290), ZWI ZWICHEL (At5g65930), and ATACA9, which auto inhibits Ca(2+)-ATPase 9 (At3g21180) [70,71,72], all had diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells adapted to the spaceflight environment. An essential conclusion drawn from examining the differentially expressed genes in the vertical dimension was that these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the horizontal comparison of the ground adapted states. Therefore, the way both cell genotypes modulated the expression of cell wall genes during the physiological adaptation (vertical comparison) inevitably led to substantial differences in the distinct gene expression profiles of the WT and HSFA2 KO spaceflight-adapted cells (horizontal comparison) (Section 2.3.2). Summarizing, the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight exhibited the diminished cell wall remodeling processes leading presumably to cell wall thinning compared to the ground HSFA2 KO cells, therefore supporting the potential specific HSFA2 roles in the cell wall reorganization in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state. Another specific role for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation is associated with the plasma membrane. Several genes associated with processes on the plasma membrane were differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells in spaceflight (horizontal comparison) (see Section 2.3.2, Table A2, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material). Examples include the overexpression of membrane kinase receptors such as: Leucine-rich repeat domain protein kinase family proteins, LRKs (At5g65240, At5g25930), STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980), and BIR1 BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase (At5g48380) [73]. Membrane receptors such as these are essential for myriad processes, including sensing chemical and physical stimuli from the environment. The abundance of the receptor proteins’ presence at the membrane translates to cell’s sensitivity to the extracellular compounds binding to these receptors and it is possible that HSFA2 KO cells modulated their responsiveness by increasing the receptors expression. It is also possible that in the absence of the HSFA2, the signal transduction from the membrane receptors is altered. The directional link between the expression of the LRR-RLK genes, enhanced expression of HsfA2, and many Hsf and Hsp genes and response to the exogenously administered arsenic was found in Arabidopsis roots, suggesting that HSFA2 may have a function in the response to toxic metals in the growth medium [74]. The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight seemed to also differ from the spaceflight WT cells (horizontal comparison) in starch biosynthesis (see Section 2.3.2). Genes central to starch biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate/bisphosphoglyce PGM (At1g78050), isoamylase 1(At2g39930), and NDHN oxidoreductase (AT5G58260), were substantially underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to WT. The reports on starch content in plants in microgravity vary with the experiment and plant species [75,76,77], but it is possible that HSFA2 plays a role in the carbohydrate metabolism and energy reserve metabolic processes in microgravity that contributes to the diverse response of plants to spaceflight. 3.2. HSFA2 is Much More Than a Heat Shock Factor—Things Learned from Space Although HSFA2 is part of the Heat Shock Factor network, the molecular phenotype of the HSFA2 KO in response to spaceflight shows that the gene plays an essential role in physiological adaptation that is well beyond simple thermal metabolism. Aspects of that role are revealed by examination of the gene expression differences on the ground between HSFA2 KO and WT. Disabling the expression of HsfA2 caused a change in the expression of 349 genes in the ground environment. Therefore, cells that did not express HsfA2 lacked not only one gene, but 349, as they were launched into orbit, and they all potentially contributed to the cells’ metabolic state both in the control and in the spaceflight microgravity environment. This 349-gene difference highlights the importance of recognizing the cells’ ground adapted state while looking for the differences in the tested environment which, in this study, is the environment of spaceflight. Nearly two-thirds of the genes differentially expressed between the HSFA2 KO and WT ground cells showed diminished expression in knockout cells, which could be explained by the transcription factor function of the HSFA2 (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material). The most prominent class of genes underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground as compared to the WT is associated with protein folding (Table A2; Figure S4 drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). These genes included the chaperone, co-chaperone, and no-chaperone coding genes that were reported among the critical protein folding genes in Arabidopsis [40]. Such diminished expression of some chaperone genes was in accordance with the microarray dataset obtained from the A. thaliana HSFA2 KO plants (Array Express accession number E-GEOD-4760) [78]. Additionally, plants overexpressing HsfA2 had elevated expression level of many chaperones in non-stressed conditions [79]. For instance, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HsfA2 gene overexpressed many Hsp genes, including 18 genes associated with cell rescue and virulence related genes in normal conditions [45]. The overexpression of HsfA2 increased the plant’s tolerance to combined environmental stresses, while plants with knocked out HsfA2 gene had reduced basal and acquired thermotolerance and oxidative stress tolerance [46]. These observations suggest that HSFA2 regulates the housekeeping expression of the protein folding genes not solely in response to stress. The severe underexpression of protein folding genes in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground that compromised the efficiency of the folding machinery was further manifested by the overexpression of the ER stress genes, notably 3 critical genes of the UPR involved in oxidative protein folding PDIs/ERO1 (alias ATPDIL1-2 (At1g77510), ATPDIL2-1 UNE5 (At2g47470) and AERO1 (At1g72280)). It seems that the HsfA2 mutation compromised the basic maintenance of the protein folding processes that altered the ER homeostasis and that led to ER stress. As the ER stress is a hallmark of the environmental stress response, it can further explain why the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground showed enhanced expression of abiotic stress response genes, particularly genes involved in response to drought, extreme temperature, and high salinity. The genes dehydrin (AT1G54410), a hydrophobic protein RCI2A (AT3G0588), and DREB2B (AT3G11020) were all upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells in the control, ground environment [80,81,82]. In analyzing the differentially expressed ER stress genes, it seems that if a cell experiences ER stress due to an inefficiency of the protein folding machinery resulting from its genetic background, and not the environment, the cells still send a stress-response signal cascade as they would in response to damaging exogenous or environmental stimuli and activates the stress response. Therefore, the cells actively engaging in the stress response were sent to the ISS, which could explain the hypersensitive features of the HSFA2 KO cells in the spaceflight-adapted state. HSFA2 KO underexpressed genes related to oxidative stress tolerance in the ground environment (see Table A2, Figure S4 drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). A strong link between HSFA2 and the oxidative stress response and tolerance is well established [83,84,85]. For instance, the gene At5g61640 coding PMSR1, a ubiquitous enzyme that repairs oxidatively damaged proteins, was underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground, suggesting compromised tolerance to stress at minimum oxidative stress. Fundamental metabolic processes can also be impacted by the environment; carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall remodeling are good examples of where HSFA2 plays a role these types of responses. Genes that are involved in the response to sucrose were also expressed at a lower level in HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state compared to WT. For instance, the Cold acclimation protein WCOR413 family (AT4G37220) gene, a canonical, highly sensitive sugar-repressed gene [86] was downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. In accordance, DIN3 DARK INDUCIBLE 3 (AT3G06850) and MCCB 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (AT4G34030), both mitochondrial proteins involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation during sugar starvation [87,88] were also down-regulated. Glucose level may influence protein folding, as high glucose stimulates de novo protein synthesis, making it possible that diminished gene expression of sugar-responsive genes is part of the UPR’s strategy to minimize the level of de novo protein translation and to prevent further overload of the ER folding [89]. This connection further reinforces the link between diminished carbohydrate metabolic processes and adaptation to the spaceflight environment as observed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. Cell wall remodeling is influenced by a variety of developmental and environmental cues, and it is well established that there are multiple strategies to achieve an operational goal. The extent to which HSFA2 contributes to the regulation of these strategies was revealed by comparing the expression of cell wall related genes in the HSFA2 KO to WT. It has been demonstrated in many studies that plants in space utilize genes involved in the response to pathogen attack, despite the absence of any pathogens [20]. This misconceived pathogen response could be a result of reduced gravity loading causing a distortion on the cell wall, threatening cell wall integrity similar to the physical damage that the cell wall sustains under pathogen wounding or herbivore attack. Both the WT cells and the HSFA2 KO cells differentially express cell wall-associated genes typical of pathogen attach, but not the same genes. For instance, while WT cells engaged PEN2 (AT2G44490), which triggers callose deposition in the cell wall and glucosinolate activation [90], along with two other genes (At3g43250, AT5G38980) reported to function in wounding and in defense response, the HSFA2 KO cells engaged the Disease resistance protein CC-NBS-LRR class gene (AT1G59124) [91] and NTA Seven transmembrane MLO family protein gene (AT2G17430) [92] instead. All of these genes are involved in mounting a defense in response to pathogen attack, but the gene out of this general class that is utilized depends very much on whether the genome contains an active HsfA2 gene. Thus, the differences in the cells’ physiological state on the ground dictate the requirement for molecular changes in order to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There was only one gene, At2g03760, coding brassinosteroid sulfotransferase 12 (SOT12), engaged in the same way in both genotypes during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The enhanced expression of SOT12 was correlated with actively growing cell cultures and in response to salt, osmotic stress, hormone treatments, but also in the defense response to a bacterial pathogen attack [93]. However, the physiological adaptation of the WT cells and HSFA2 KO cells shared 2 other genes, the U12-type spliceosome (At3g10400), and the Cystatin/monellin protein of unknown function (At4g03570); yet they showed an opposite change in their relative expression (see Figure 5A, Section 2.4.1). The U12 introns, although rare, are indispensable for normal growth and development of plants [94]. The U12 intron splicing is part of the non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is important for destroying transcripts with premature stop codons [95]. Interestingly, the HsfA2 transcript in its alternative form HsfA2-II is degraded via the NMD pathway [96]. Both genes showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells relative to their ground counterparts, while in the WT cells, the expression was enhanced in the respective comparison. However, both genes were overexpressed in the ground in HSFA2 KO cells compared to WT ground cells. As a result of the expression adjustments that occurred in the spaceflight cells, both genotypes achieved the matching expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. This solitary example of the two genes underlines the importance of the ground-adapted state gene expression status that mandates requirements for the gene expression changes during the physiological adaptation to the novel spaceflight environment. 3.3. Role of HSFA2 in Spaceflight Adaptive Processes Comparing the gene expression profiles among space-adapted genotypes allowed the identification of the genes Required to be expressed at certain levels in order for a plant cell to adapt to spaceflight. There were genes uniquely involved in the physiological adaptation of WT cells but not in HSFA2 KO cells, as they were already expressed at a spaceflight-adapted level in HSFA2 KO on the ground (see Figure 5C, Section 2.4.1). Thus, the WT cells needed to alter the expression level of these genes from their terrestrially observed level to express them at a level required for spaceflight survival, while the HSFA2 KO cells arrived at the ISS with these genes already expressed at the required level. For instance, the PDIL1-2 (AT1G77510) gene involved in the UPR and CUL2 (At1g02980), a ubiquitin E3 ligase of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) class, was expressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground at the level required for the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3) [97]. The cullin protein is a part of a complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic turnover of proteins in a highly specific manner [98]. As mentioned above, with a change of the environment, de novo protein synthesis likely intensifies, increasing the chance for aberrant accumulation of unfolded proteins; thus, some elements of protein metabolism in the ER are indispensable to ensure proper ER homeostasis when the WT cells are exposed to a different environment. As already discussed, the HSFA2 KO cells had the UPR activated in a ground-adapted state due to inefficiency in the protein folding and, therefore, were already equipped with the correcting mechanisms when the environmental change occurred. Some other required genes were related to cell wall remodeling. For instance, a subtilase-like protein (At1g30600), with cell-wall glycoside hydrolase activity, that participates in the processing and/or turnover of cell wall proteins, was upregulated in the WT cells in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but this upregulation was not observed in HSFA2 KO cells, and the WT expression level in the spaceflight adaptive state matched that of the HSFA2 KO cells [64]. Cell wall protein degradation is likely to accompany any changes to the cell wall proteome related to cell wall remodeling; therefore, the expression of genes involved in proteolysis had to be at a specific level in spaceflight irrespective of the cell’s genetic background. Another required gene for spaceflight adaptation was the penetration 2 (PEN2) alias beta-glucosidase 26 (At2g44490) gene, which encodes glycosyl hydrolase. PEN2 was already mentioned as a component of the WT physiological adaptation and recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses by callose deposition in the cell wall [99]. The defense response was a biological process shared by WT and HSFA2 KO cells by the genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Identifying the defense response genes among the set of required genes supports the importance of this process in order for a cell to adapt to spaceflight. Using the HSFA2 KO cells allowed identification of genes with expression Corrected to the wild type levels in order for cells to adapt to spaceflight. These genes were uniquely involved in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight and did not have to be engaged in WT cells, as their expression was affected by the absence of a functional HsfA2 gene in the ground-adapted state. Thus, the WT cells did not have to make any adjustments to their expression in spaceflight; only HSFA2 KO cells had to bring the expression to a certain level and thus correct the expression level of these genes to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5D, Section 2.4.1). These corrected genes in the knockout cells define a new part of the overall landscape of essential genes to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state that would have been overlooked if only WT cells were used. Genes of the defense response, biotic and mechanical stimuli, and cell wall remodeling were already identified in plant wild type cells in spaceflight (see Section 3.2) [14,100,101], yet the utilization of HSFA2 KO cells provided additional insight into the repertoire of genes significant to these responses. The MLO7 Seven transmembrane MLO family protein (At2g17430), FBS1 F-box stress induced 1 (At1g61340), ILL6 IAA-leucine resistant (ILR)-like gene 6 (At1g44350), and AtPP2-A13 PP2-A13 phloem protein 2-A13 (At3g61060) are a few examples of individual genes which respond to wounding, mechanical stress, or external stimuli that had their expression level increased in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to match the WT spaceflight levels (see Table A3) [102,103,104]. Also, strictly cell wall modification genes, including PME1 pectin methylesterase 1 (At1g53840), NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein (At2g02400) that functions in lignin biosynthetic process ENODL17, and early nodulin-like protein 17 (At5g15350) associated with cell wall pectin metabolic process had their expression levels elevated in spaceflight from the level on the ground, so that it matched the WT levels in spaceflight (see Table A3). Next, genes that encode transport proteins had their expression adjusted in HSFA2 KO cells to that of WT level, so they became evenly expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state. For instance, the transmembrane transporter genes ATATH9 ABC2 homolog (At2g40090), porin (At1g50400) family protein, and GAMMA-TIP aquaporin (At2g36830) were no longer differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, as their expression was adjusted in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells (see Table A3). Similarly, nitrate transporter genes ENTH/ANTH/VHS (At4g40080) superfamily protein, and NRT2.7 (At5g14570) were also differentially expressed in spaceflight to match the WT expression levels of these genes. It is, however, uncertain how the loss of HSFA2 function was able to affect the transport of various moieties across the membrane in the ground environment, yet it seems that these transport processes had attained a particular level of efficiency for adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of several branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation enzymes, the expression levels of which were also corrected from a low level of expression to a higher level of expression in the HSFA2 KO cells when compared to the expression level in WT cells in the spaceflight environment. The dark inducible 3, DIN3 gene (At3g06850) coding the subunits of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), and two other genes important to small amino acid degradation, MCCB (At4g34030) coding for subunit β of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase participating in BCKDC reactions, and ALDH6B2 (At2g14170) methylmalonate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase (see Table A3). A large increase in BCAA accumulation can be observed due to environmental stress, such as darkness and carbohydrate starvation [88,105]. It is plausible that in the ground environment, the BCAA catabolism was reduced in the HSFA2 KO cells due to the overall problems with the cellular protein homeostasis, while the spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of BCAAs, similar to that under abiotic stress, thereby raising the demand for the BCAA degradation enzyme function. Overall, using a knockout line greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment and thereby amplifies the information gained from rare spaceflight experimentation opportunities to learn what sort of biological processes are necessary, what genes are involved in those processes, and what factors control the expression of those genes. 3.4. Genotypic Adaptation to Spaceflight There were a few genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure 5E, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that without HSFA2 function, cells failed to properly regulate these genes’ expression to adapt to spaceflight, and therefore, the expression of these particular genes in the spaceflight adaptation is dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene. For instance, the WT cells increased the expression of ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase (At4g07960), suggesting a higher rate of cellulose synthesis and thus cell wall reorganization processes in spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3) [106]. Cell wall remodeling processes seemed to differ between the two genotypes, and it is possible that the increase in the cellulose synthesis in spaceflight-adapted cells somehow depends on the function of HSFA2. An alternative to the idea that genes engaged only in WT cells in spaceflight are dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene is that some of the genes engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells were only required in WT cells but not in KO cells. In other words, it was not the inability to engage these genes that excluded them from those expressed in spaceflight, but rather simply that there was no need for them. For instance, a gene coding the membrane receptor SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980) protein was downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but not in those of the HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in lower expression level in WT spaceflight-adapted state than in HSFA2 KO cells. The STRUBBELIG (SUB) receptor mediates the signaling pathway of cell morphogenesis, the orientation of plane of cellular division, and cell proliferation [107]. It is unclear why the WT cells would diminish the expression of this membrane receptor in spaceflight, yet either a function of HSFA2 is required, or an aspect of HSFA2 KO physiology makes expression of SRF5 superfluous in the spaceflight environment. There were a few genes engaged only in HSFA2 KO cells and not WT cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure 5F, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that only cells with a disabled HsfA2 gene were needed to make changes to these genes’ expression. This reflects the HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation to spaceflight environment and likely represents the genes Compensated for the loss of HSFA2 function in that environment. Among the compensating genes with enhanced expression was the aforementioned gene of the UPR: PDI-like 2-3 (At2g32920), supporting the importance of the UPR and likely the ERAD, as well as HSFA2 KO, cells in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3). WT cells did not need to adjust expression of these particular genes. The ATGSTU25 glutathione S-transferase TAU 25 (At1g171800) gene was another gene with enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. While genes encoding glutathione S-transferase TAU (e.g., ATGSTU1, ATGSTU3, ATGSTU24) were generally overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in either environment, the HSFA2 KO cells further elevated the expression of the glutathione S-transferase genes in spaceflight to compensate for the loss of HSFA2 function in this environment. Similarly, vesicle-mediated transporter genes were among those consistently differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT regardless of the environment, but HSFA2 KO induced additional similar genes during physiological adaptation to spaceflight and showed overexpression of such genes in the spaceflight-adapted state. Examples in this category included the Coatomer, beta’ subunit (At3g15980), Target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (At1g29060) and Integral membrane Yip1 family protein (At2g36300) genes related to ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi vesicular traffic, suggesting that these processes needed to be compensated for the lack of HSFA2’s function in the spaceflight environment. The HSFA2 KO cells decreased the expression of the two calcium pump Ca(2+)-ATPase genes, ACA9 (At3g21180), and ACA2 (At4g37640) resulting in their underexpression in the spaceflight-adapted state relative to WT cells (see Table A3). Aside from their involvement in calcium homeostasis and calcium second messenger functions, these calcium pumps were also shown to participate in protein processing in the secretory pathway [108]. Interestingly, there was another gene with the same expression profile coding, the RMR1 transmembrane receptor (At5g66160) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. The RMR1 functions as a sorting cargo receptor for protein trafficking [109]. Thus, the HSFA2 KO cell’s strategy for adapting to the spaceflight environment included reducing the protein sorting and trafficking to the destination, possibly to compensate for the basic inefficiency in these processes when the HSFA2 was disabled.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Conclusions from these data concern non-thermal roles for the heat shock factors in the physiological adaptation of plant cells to spaceflight. First, the heat shock transcription factor HSFA2, and likely the whole HSF network, has important roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through regulation of cell wall and plasma membrane signaling, as well as starch biosynthesis. Second, disabling HsfA2 leads to activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and the unfolded protein stress response and dramatically alters adaptation to spaceflight. Without HSFA2, a much larger change in gene expression is required for spaceflight adaptation. Third, the endoplasmic reticulum and unfolded protein stress responses define the HSFA2 KO cell physiological state regardless of the environment, likely because of the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. Fourth, the HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the wild type adaptation to spaceflight by identifying a set of genes with a required expression level for a cell to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state, thus suggesting that genetic approaches provide additional insights beyond those revealed by differential gene expression in WT cells.",

Copyright notice ID: 6359015 PMID: 30658467 Abstract Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.

Introduction Survival in a challenging environment requires a coordinated system that enables a living organism to respond appropriately to a change. The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants [1,2] and with specific assays of expression [3,4,5,6,7]. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments [8,9,10,11]. Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Even unicellular plants are capable of sensing a change in the gravitational environment and there have been several spaceflight experiments that examine the transcriptomes of single plant cells, and undifferentiated plants cells, which also lack traditional gravity-sensing organs [4,19,25,26,27,28]. The wealth of information on the transcriptional changes that accompany the adjustments to spaceflight begins to suggest common strategies for adjusting to the spaceflight environment; however, the underlying question of why certain genes are necessary remains unanswered. One group of genes strongly represented in many spaceflight transcriptomes is composed of the heat shock transcription factors and proteins that comprise the Heat Shock Factor network [15,19]. Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes in response to almost any environmental stress and are essential to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms (for review, please see [29]). HSF genes are evolutionarily conserved and are represented in the genomes of almost every organism. Given the conservation of the HSF network and its general roles in stress responses, it was perhaps not surprising to see HSFs represented in the response to spaceflight in plants. Their particularly strong representation in cell cultures; however, suggested HSFs could play a unique role in the spaceflight response of undifferentiated cells [4]. One hallmark of cellular stress is the accumulation of denatured proteins. The main gene targets of HSF-induced transcriptional activation are the stress response proteins that act as molecular chaperones [29,30,31,32]. These chaperones not only protect a cell from denatured protein accumulation, but also assure proper protein folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins indispensable in response to stress. The Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the main chaperones of the folding machinery, but there are also other non-chaperone proteins assisting in efficient protein maturation [33,34,35]. For instance, a pair of enzymes, including a disulfide carrier protein (protein disulfide isomerase, PDI), and a disulfide-generating enzyme (endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1, ERO1 and protein disulfide isomerase, PDI, PDIs/ERO1) catalyze oxidative protein folding by creating disulfide bonds, thereby assisting in proper protein sorting [36,37]. Protein folding occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also serves as the main hub for the secretory pathways and protein delivery to their final destinations. The ER uses an extensive surveillance called the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) system, which assures that only properly folded proteins exit the ER and maintains proper physiological homeostasis in the ER [38]. When there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a stress signal is emitted. Initially, a cell activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) intended to increase the ER folding capacity in an attempt to refold the aberrant proteins [39,40]. If these UPR solutions to the unfolded protein accumulation problem fail, or if the accumulation of misfolded proteins is massive, then the final UPR step—the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)—is activated. The ERAD eliminates and destroys the misfolded proteins via proteasome digestion, preventing further protein aggregation. The luminal lectin OS9 in cooperation with a membrane spanning protein SEL1/HRD3 recognizes the unfolded glycosylated proteins which are then ubiquitinylated by the HRD1 E3 ligase, removed from the ER lumen, and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytoplasm [41,42]. Taken collectively, ER homeostasis works as a sensor for environmental stimuli, and the ER stress signal initiates a subcellular stress response system that can secure protein homeostasis during environmental changes [43,44]. The HsfA2 gene is a member of the large family of Hsf genes in the HSF network and is a key regulator of the defense response via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation to several types of environmental stresses, namely extreme temperatures (high and low), hydrogen peroxide, and high light intensity [45,46,47]. The HSFA2 protein has been demonstrated itself to be the main coordinator of the UPR during heat stress [48]. The critical involvement of HSFA2 in the response to extreme environments makes it an excellent target candidate for studying the effects of spaceflight on plants and to test if plants use the same universal stress response mechanism evolved terrestrially to accommodate the novel space gravitational environment. HSFA2 may also have an additional role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment beyond the UPR induction of the chaperone-based protein folding machinery. The genes encoding HSFs and HSPs were reported to be upregulated in spaceflight in many biological systems [26,49]. The HsfA2 gene specifically was the highest upregulated gene in the wild type Arabidopsis cell cultures after 12 days in space [4,19]. Moreover, HSFA2 was shown to function in amplification of the signal in response to brassinosteroids, calcium, and auxin and was reported to be affected in Arabidopsis in spaceflight, and therefore has the potential for playing a role in the gravity sensing signal transduction cascade [13,20,50]. In the unicellular yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the HSF targets represent nearly 3% of the genome and the diversity of their functions supports a broad role for HSF in coordinating the multitude of cellular processes occurring in normal and stressful conditions [51]. Since the HSFs play a role in various cellular processes such as development, cellular lifespan, cell differentiation and proliferation, the likelihood that HSFA2 will play some role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight increases [52,53]. Cell lines from wild type (WT) Col-0 and an HsfA2 knockout (HSFA2 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Cannisters 17 (BRIC17) payload. The experiments here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to samples grown on the ground. Descriptions and discussions will consider not only the spaceflight adaptation experience for each genotype, but also the gene expression profiles in the ground and spaceflight environments between genotypes. It was our goal to develop a better understanding of how cells, disabled in a primary regulator of environmental stress response, react to an unfamiliar environment outside of their evolutionary experience. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding not only of HSFA2’s role in adjusting to novel environments, but also the broader scope of the processes involved spaceflight physiological adaptation in plant cells.2. Results In this experiment, the pattern of gene expression that defined the adapted state was established after ten days of growth in the BRIC hardware in two environments: spaceflight, and ground control in the two genotypes: HSFA2 KO, and WT. Cell clusters of both genotypes were applied in comparable density for both treatments, and continued growth in the spaceflight and ground control environments (Figure 1). Figure 1.

The first or “vertical” dimension of the analysis involved the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of the cells grown in spaceflight to those grown on the ground for each of the two cell lines (see red box in Figure 2A, and refer also to [28] for a similar experimental design). For clarity, this vertical comparison was termed the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment of either HSFA2 KO or WT cells. Genes identified in this vertical comparison contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to spaceflight in each genotype. The second or “horizontal” dimension of the analysis involved comparison of gene expression profiles between the two genotypes within the same environment: ground (see green box of Figure 2A) and spaceflight (see blue box of Figure 2A). In the ground horizontal comparison, gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground was compared to gene expression in WT cells on the ground, thus defining unique genes of the ground adapted state for each genotype. Similarly, in a spaceflight horizontal comparison, the gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight was compared to gene expression in WT cells in spaceflight, thus defining unique genes required for the spaceflight adapted state in each genotype. Finally, the sets of genes obtained from a comparison of the first and second dimension were analyzed together, and their interdependence was examined. Figure 2.

The WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FWt : GWt comparison group (see red box on the left in Figure 2A), the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FHsf : GHsf comparison group (red box on the right in Figure 2A), the genotypic adaptation to ground was identified in the GHsf : GWt comparison group (see green box at the bottom in Figure 2A), and the genotypic adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the FHsf : FWt comparison group (blue box on top in Figure 2A). The genes that were differentially expressed in these comparisons are outlined in the following sections in terms of the numbers of differentially expressed genes represented in general ontology categories. Full annotations of the genes in each category are presented in Appendix A Table A1 and Table A2. 2.1. The HsfA2 Expression Levels across Samples The raw gene expression values in microarrays, measured as a fluorescence signal intensity, showed that the HsfA2 transcript was abundant in the WT undifferentiated cells in the ground control samples. The average raw expression of the HsfA2 gene in the 4 biological replicates of the WT ground control cells was 4171 (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material). In contrast, the average raw HsfA2 gene expression in the 3 biological replicates of the HSFA2 KO ground control cells was only 39. Thus, there was a deficit of −7.27 log2 Fold Change (P-value 2.9 × 10−9) of the HsfA2 transcript in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells on the ground, demonstrating that the T-DNA insertion mutation severely depressed HsfA2 expression. There was no statistically significant difference in the HsfA2 expression levels between spaceflight and corresponding ground control for either the WT cells or the HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material). 2.2. Different Genes Characterize the Physiological Adaptation of the WT and HSFA2 KO Cells to Spaceflight 2.2.1. The Genes Characterizing the Physiological Adaptation of WT Cells to Spaceflight—FWt : GWt The genes involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in WT spaceflight cells (FWt) to the WT ground control cells (GWt) in the FWt : GWt group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 46 genes were upregulated and 32 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 3, File S1 GO 78 FWtGWt in the Supplementary Material). The microarray data are publicly available from GEO (GSE95388) and GeneLab (number TBD). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 78 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from the FWt : GWt group comparison, and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from the FHsf : GHsf group comparison.The upregulated genes identified from the FWt : GWt group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under two GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and regulation of biological processes (GO:0050789). Many of these genes are associated with defense, wounding, and cell wall metabolism (Table A1). The downregulated genes identified from FWt : GWt group comparison represented genes that were downregulated in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under the regulation of biological process GO term (GO:0050789) and under the categories of endomembrane systems (GO:0012505) and Golgi associated (GO:0005794). Many of these genes are associated with cellular transport and receptors (Table A1).2.2.2. HSFA2 KO Cells Changed the Expression of Three Times More Genes than Seen in WT Cells—FHsf : GHsf The genes involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells (FHsf) to HSFA2 KO ground control cells (GHsf) in the FHsf : GHsf group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 221 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 112 genes were upregulated, and 109 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 3, File S2 GO 221 FHsfGHsf in the Supplementary Material). The upregulated genes identified from FHsf : GHsf group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of biological process ontology: the defense response genes to other organism (GO:0098542), including response to wounding, cellular response to sucrose starvation (GO:0043617) and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation (GO:0009083) (see Table A1). The downregulated genes identified from FHsf : GHsf group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 2 GO terms of biological process ontology: closely related growth, developmental process (GO:0032502) and anatomical structure morphogenesis (GO:0009653), particularly those involved in cell elongation, cell wall loosening, and multidimensional cell growth. These downregulated genes also fell under 2 GO terms of the cellular component ontology: plant-type cell wall (GO:0009505) and plasma membrane (GO:0005886) (see Table A1).2.3. WT and HSFA2 KO Show More Difference in Gene Expression Profiles in Their Ground-Adapted State than in Spaceflight-Adapted State 2.3.1. Genotype Specific Genes of the Ground-Adapted State—GHsf : GWt Comparison of the gene expression profiles of the ground-adapted states between the HSFA2 KO and WT cells shows the consequences of the HsfA2 gene loss for cells in the ground environment. The genes differentially expressed in the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO ground cells (GHsf) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the GHsf : GWt group comparison (see Figure 2). There were 349 genes significantly differentially expressed between WT and HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state at P-value < 0.01 and log2 Fold Change > 1; 115 genes were upregulated and 234 genes were downregulated (see Figure 2B, Figure 4, File S3 GO 349 GHsfGWt in the Supplementary Material). Genotypes in ground-adapted state displayed the greatest differences in gene expression profiles than in any other comparison group. Thirty-three percent of genes had an enhanced expression in the ground-adapted state in HSFA2 KO cells compared to WT cells, and 67% had diminished expression (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 349 genes of the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group comparison and 220 genes of the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group comparison.In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the upregulated genes identified from the GHsf : GWt group comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and defense response to other organism (GO:0098542), particularly to: nematode, fungus, bacterium and to wounding, water deprivation (GO:0009414) related to high salinity, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) (GO:0034976) and unfolded protein response (UPR) (GO:0006986) and response to misfolded protein (GO:0051788), localization (GO:0051179), transport (GO:0006810), establishment of localization (GO:0051234) (see Table A2). In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the GHsf : GWt group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and response to stress (GO:0006950), including chaperones and non-chaperones, response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979), response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0000302), response to hydrogen peroxide (GO:0042542), response to sucrose stimulus (GO:0009744) and cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process (GO:0006519), such as biosynthesis of phenylalanine, asparagine, tryptophan and flavonoid (see Table A2). 2.3.2. Genotype Specific Genes of the Spaceflight-Adapted State—FHsf : FWt A comparison of the gene expression profiles of spaceflight-adapted states between the HSFA2 KO and WT cells shows cells’ adaptation to spaceflight environment if the HSFA2 function was disabled. Thus, these genes indicate the genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. The genes differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO cells and WT cells were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles in HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells (FHsf) to WT spaceflight cells (FWt) in the FHsf : FWt group comparison (see Figure 2A). There were 220 genes significantly differentially expressed between HSFA2 KO and WT cell samples in spaceflight (see Figure 2B, Figure 4, File S4 GO 220 FHsfFWt in the Supplementary Material). The 95 genes were more highly expressed in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells in spaceflight, while 125 genes were downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells as compared to WT cells in spaceflight. In the HSFA2 KO and WT spaceflight-adapted state, the upregulated genes identified from the FHsf : FWt group comparison, represented genes that were overexpressed in cells disabled in HsfA2 in spaceflight compared to WT cells in spaceflight. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: defense response to other organism (GO:0098542), response to topologically incorrect protein (GO:0035966), response to unfolded protein (UPR) (GO:0006986) and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (GO:0036503), as well as protein localization (GO:0008104), establishment of protein localization (GO:0045184), protein transport (GO:0015031), vesicle-mediated transport (GO:0016192), transport (GO:0006810), establishment of localization (GO:0051234), including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and secondary metabolic process (GO:0019748) (see Table A2). Additionally, these upregulated genes represented plasma membrane GO term (GO:0005886) including plasma membrane receptor kinases of the cellular component ontology (see Table A2). In the HSFA2 KO and WT spaceflight-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the FHsf : FWt group comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled in HsfA2 in spaceflight compared to WT cells in spaceflight. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of cellular compartment ontology: cell wall (GO:0005618), external encapsulating structure (GO:0030312) including xylem development, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, plastid (GO:0009536) and energy reserve metabolic process (GO:0006112) including starch biosynthetic process (GO:0019252) (see Table A2).2.4. Occurrence of Individual Genes and Gene Function Across Collective Comparisons of Physiological Adaptation, Ground and Spaceflight-Adapted States 2.4.1. In the Response to Spaceflight, There Were Only Four Differentially Expressed Genes Represented in Both the WT and HSFA2 KO Comparisons (FWt : GWt to FHsf : GHsf) When the 78 differentially expressed genes in the FWt : GWt group comparison were compared to the 221 genes differentially expressed in the FHsf : GHsf group comparison, only one gene changed in the exact same way, At2g03760, which encodes a putative steroid sulfotransferase (see Figure 3, Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). At2g03760 was upregulated in spaceflight cells relative to their ground counterparts in both cell lines. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The heat map visualization of the selected significantly differentially expressed genes arranged by a specific expression patterns in the four comparison groups FWt : GWt, FHsf : GHsf, GHsf : GWt, FHsf : FWt. A through F designate a category for respective expression pattern. (A) genes were selected by presence among the physiological adaptation genes: 4 genes shared by the 78 of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt group comparison and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf group comparison; (B) genes were selected by presence among the ground and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 28 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group and in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt; (C) genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 10 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt comparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group. These genes were categorized as Required; (D) Genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 66 genes that showed opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf comparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf : GWt group. These genes were categorized as Corrected; (E) Genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 7 genes that showed the opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt : GWt comparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group. These genes were categorized as HsfA2-dependent. In addition, reflect WT genotypic adaptation; (F) genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 53 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf : GHsf comparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf : FWt group. These genes were categorized as Compensated, and reflect HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation.Two of the genes differentially expressed in spaceflight for both HSFA2 KO and WT cells were expressed in opposite directions. During spaceflight, these genes were upregulated in WT cells, while being down regulated HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). These genes were: At3g10400-RNA recognition motif, and CCHC-type zinc finger domain containing protein and At4g03570-Cystatin/monellin superfamily protein. However, these two genes showed significant differential expressions in ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, being overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells. The genes were not differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells. Therefore, although the genes seemed to be engaged conversely in the physiological adaptation in two cell lines, their expression adjustments in either HSFA2 KO or WT cells resulted in no different expression level in spaceflight-adapted state. The differential expression level on the ground caused HSFA2 KO cells to diminish the expression of these genes, and WT cells to increase in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. One additional gene was expressed in opposite directions in response to spaceflight. At4g02460-PMS1 DNA mismatch repair protein was upregulated in WT and downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells (see Figure 5A, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material).2.4.2. Only 28 Genes Differentially Expressed Between the Two Genotypes in the Ground-Adapted State were also Differentially Expressed in the Spaceflight-Adapted State (GHsf : GWt to FHsf : FWt) When the 349 genes differentially expressed in the GHsf : GWt group comparison were juxtaposed to the 220 genes of differentially expressed in the FHsf : FWt group comparison, only 28 genes showed the same differential expression (see Figure 4, Figure 5B). Among these genes were those representing response to toxic substance ontology (At2g29490-ATGSTU1 glutathione S-transferase tau 1, At2g29470-ATGSTU3 glutathione S-transferase tau 3, At1g17170-ATGSTU24 glutathione S-transferase tau 24), and transport, establishment of localization, and localization (At3g44340-CEF ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, At1g29310-SecY protein transport family protein, At1g78570-RHM1 RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS 1 dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, At1g71140-MATE efflux family protein, At5g54860-Major facilitator superfamily protein).2.4.3. Required and Corrected Genes for the Spaceflight-Adapted State Some genes differentially expressed in the ground-adapted state between WT and HSFA2 KO were involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT or HSFA2 KO cells. The differential expression of the 349 genes expressed in the ground-adapted state, the GHsf : GWt group comparison, was assessed in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt : GWt comparison group, and in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf : GHsf comparison group. If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the WT cells but not of HSFA2 KO cells, then it was defined as required. For a gene to be required it had to meet these criteria: WT cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. WT cells differentially expressed the gene on the ground compared to HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. HSFA2 KO cells did not change the gene’s expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in WT spaceflight was similar to the expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight. Therefore, required genes are those whose expression levels in WT cells in spaceflight match the expression in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight. HSFA2 KO cells already have the space-adapted expression level. There were 10 genes that met these criteria (see Figure 5C, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the HSFA2 KO cells but not of the WT cells, then it was defined as corrected. For a gene to be classified as corrected it needed to meet these criteria: HSFA2 KO cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. HSFA2 KO cells differentially expressed the corrected gene on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. WT cells did not change the corrected gene expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight is similar to the expression level of the gene in WT in spaceflight. Therefore, corrected genes are those whose expression levels in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight match the WT expression levels in spaceflight. These are genes that HSFA2 KO differentially expressed to match WT levels in order to adapt to spaceflight. These genes would not be revealed in an examination of WT cells alone. There were 66 genes that met these criteria (see Figure 5D, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). Thus, these 66 genes were considered to be corrected in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their expression levels were returned to WT levels in order adapt to spaceflight. Only 5 genes out of 66 were overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground relative to WT cell on the ground and thus were downregulated in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight to even the WT expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. The 61 genes showed diminished expression on the ground in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells on the ground, but were upregulated during spaceflight to match the WT expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. These 5 genes included: At3g44800-Meprin and TRAF (MATH) homology domain-containing protein of unknown function, At5g52260-myb19 a transcription factor, At2g35340-MEE29 maternal effect embryo arrest 29, At2g46960-CYP709B1 cytochrome P450 functioning in oxidation-reduction processes, and At5g15350-ENODL17 early nodulin-like protein 17 associated with cell wall pectin metabolic process. The 61 genes included genes associated with: response to wounding, mechanical stress, cell wall, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, as well as transmembrane transporter and nitrate transporters genes (see Appendix A Table A3).2.4.4. Genotypic-Specific Spaceflight-Adapted State A comparison of the spaceflight gene expression patterns between the two genotypes revealed 220 differentially expressed genes between WT and HSFA2 KO. The expression of these 220 differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state (FHsf : FWt) was compared to the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt : GWt comparison group, and the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf : GHsf comparison group. HsfA2-Dependent Genes in the WT Genotypic Spaceflight Adaptation In the vertical comparison between spaceflight and ground gene expression patterns, there were 7 genes differentially expressed in WT that were not differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO cells. These genes were not differentially expressed between WT and HSFA2 KO in the ground-adapted state, but were differentially expressed between genotypes in the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5E, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). Thus, these genes were HsfA2-dependent, as they were adapted to the spaceflight level only if the HsfA2 gene was functional. These genes represent the WT genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. All genes but one (At4g07960-ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase-like C12 localized to Golgi apparatus, plasmodesma), were downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation and resulted in the higher expression in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO than in WT cells. These 6 genes were: At5g19070-SNARE associated Golgi protein family involved in proline transport and localized to plasma membrane, At1g78980-SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 functioning in transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and localized to extracellular region, two genes, At1g66640-RNI-like superfamily protein and At2g36560-AT hook motif DNA-binding family protein, localized to nucleus, and At2g43240-Nucleotide-sugar transporter and At1g32830-transposable element gene (see Table A3). Compensated Genes for Disabled HsfA2 in the HSFA2 KO Spaceflight Adaptation In the vertical comparison of gene expression patterns between spaceflight and ground controls for WT and HSFA2 KO cells, there were 53 genes differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO that were not differentially expressed in WT. As with the HsfA2-dependent genes described above, these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the ground-adapted state, but were differentially expressed between genotypes in the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5F, File S5 Gene lists in the Supplementary Material). These 53 genes were differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state because HSFA2 KO cells engaged these genes in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, while the WT cells did not. Thus, these genes compensated for the lack of functional HsfA2 gene. These genes represent the HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation to spaceflight. There were 6 genes out of the 53 which were upregulated in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in the higher expression level in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells. These genes were associated with ER stress, UPR and vesicle-mediated transport (see Table A3). The remaining 49 genes were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and exhibited diminished expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells. These genes included genes associated with intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and calcium pump (see Table A3).3. Discussion Undifferentiated Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures were flown to the ISS as part of the BRIC17 CEL experiment to enhance the understanding of how cells lacking HSFA2, a key transcription factor involved in the response to terrestrial stress stimuli, physiologically adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. The WT cells and the cells disabled in expression of the HsfA2 gene both survived their orbits in the ISS, indicating that they both had adapted their physiology to the novel environment despite their genotypic differences. Cells disabled in HSFA2 function used substantially more and substantially different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation leads to a remarkable conclusion about the role of the HSF network in the entire adaptation processes to spaceflight—proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network. This conclusion suggests that various aspects of HSFA2 and the HSF network illuminate important components of spaceflight adaptation in plant cells. 3.1. Universal and Specific Aspects of the HSFA2 Role in the Adaptation to Spaceflight Inevitably, the physiological adaptation to a change in the environment, including the novel change of ground to spaceflight, requires de novo protein synthesis followed by protein maturation and transport. Therefore, when a population of cells transitions to the spaceflight environment, the demands on a cell to synthesize and mature new proteins manifests in a unique manner. Unlike WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells activated the UPR as part of a strategy to adapt to spaceflight, implicating that the ability to fold proteins adequately was compromised in the HSFA2 KO cells. As previously observed at the molecular level in response to a multitude of other environmental stimuli, HSFA2 was likely working to secure cellular protein homeostasis, and the inefficiency in protein folding observed in space flown HSFA2 KO cells likely resulted from the limited HSFA2-governed regulation of molecular chaperone genes. For instance, the PDI gene, ATPDIL2-3 (At2g32920), the transcription factors WRKY33 (At2g38470), and AtGATA-1 (At3g24050) along with four other genes (Ypt/Rab-GAP domain of gyp1p superfamily protein (At3g49350), SAG21 (At4g02380), transmembrane proteins 14c (At1g50740), and unknown (At1g19020)), all of which were reported to be a part of the UPR, were uniquely abundant in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight [40]. Moreover, the pivotal gene of the ERAD, HRD3A (At1g18260), also showed enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight conditions, demonstrating activation of the destruction pathway for aberrant proteins. These results cumulatively suggest that the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight suffered from excessive aggregation of misfolded proteins and that to get rid of these misfolded and cumbersome aggregates, a degradation pathway was upregulated in order to actively remove them. Additionally, the genes of intracellular protein transport and secretion, such as Transducin/WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein (AT1G18830) alias SEC31-like protein transporter, target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (AT1G29060) and the Coatomer beta subunit (AT3G15980), which functions specifically in ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, were also upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in the spaceflight-adapted state [54]. The ATARFA1D (AT1G70490) gene coding Ras-related small GTP-binding family protein, known to be essential for vesicle coating and un-coating [55], was also upregulated in space-flown HSFA2 KO cells. This suggests that the protein sorting and delivery processes were impaired in space flown HSFA2 KO cells and that the over-induction of multiple vesicle-mediated protein transport genes was an attempt to circumvent an inefficient system of intracellular protein trafficking. As such, HSFA2 plays a role in processes involved when a cell physiologically adapts to spaceflight similar to its role as a universal coordinator of the stress response when plants adapt to a broad range of other environmental changes (see Figure 6). However, the expression patterns in the spaceflight-adapted state of the genes related to cell wall construction, signal transduction and starch biosynthesis in HSFA2 KO cells in comparison to WT cells imply more specific roles for HSFA2 beyond the universal stress response coordination. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Graphical presentation of the identified processes associated with the universal stress response and specific roles of HSFA2 in spaceflight. The filled shapes represent the biological process; the unfilled shapes represent the genes; red color indicates upregulation/enhancement; blue color represents downregulation/decrease. Text in bold highlights the key specific functions.The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight likely have a fundamentally different architecture from the wild type cell wall, along with diminished processes of cell growth, expansion, and elongation as identified by the altered gene expression profiles. Many genes encoding proteins important to these processes are downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. For instance, the gene coding glycosyltransferase QUA1 (At3g25140), involved in homogalacturonan biosynthesis and cell adhesion, the trichome birefringence-like 45 (TBL45 (At2g30010)), which functions in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, and XTH4 (AT2G06850), which executes the cleavage and reconnection of cell wall xyloglucan cross-links. It was shown for many plant systems that spaceflight caused changes to the cell wall organization; thus, the finding of this study suggests that HSFA2 may have a role in the way a plant cell remodels its wall to adapt to spaceflight microgravity [14,16,20]. Given that cells deficient in HsfA2 expression show signs of ER stress and impaired protein sorting and intracellular protein trafficking, it is possible that the proteins of the cell wall biosynthesis do not properly mature within ER, and thus fail to be properly sorted or delivered to their destination at the cell wall periphery [56,57]. However, the heat shock transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsf1, was shown to regulate cell wall remodeling in response to heat shock in a more specific fashion [58]. The yeast strain mutated in Hsf1 exhibited cell wall integrity defects in the absence of stress and Hsf1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of a set of proteins that are involved in cell wall formation and remodeling besides the universal regulation of the HSPs’ expression. The overexpression of a heat shock protein Hsp150 in S. cerevisiae caused upregulation of many cell wall proteins, leading to increased cell wall integrity and potentially enhanced the yeasts’ virulence [59]. Also, the Hsf genes were found among regulatory pathways in secondary cell wall thickening in Medicago truncatula using microarrays [60]. These examples further support HSFA2’s specific role in the remodeling of Arabidopsis cell wall architecture in the spaceflight environment. Another category of genes that suggested cell wall related roles for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation were the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes associated with wounding (see Section 2.3.2, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material). For instance, in spaceflight, HSFA2 KO cells overexpressed genes associated with glucosinolate biosynthesis (NSP5 nitrile specifier protein 5, At5g48180) and AOP1 (2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, At4g03070), in anthocyanin and flavinol biosynthesis (SRG1 senescence-related gene 1, At1g17020). These genes, and others in this category of herbivore response genes, were all overexpressed in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT spaceflight cells (horizontal comparison) [61,62,63]. The upregulation of these categories of genes suggests that the cells disabled in HsfA2 responded as they would to an herbivore attack, possibly as a consequence of diminished expression of cell wall remodeling genes, resulting in a thinning of the cell wall in spaceflight-adapted cells. The analysis of genes with differentially expressed spaceflight vs. ground control (vertical dimension) of the WT and HSFA2 KO cells further supports the concept that the cell wall remodeling is part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, and that HSFA2 has a central role in this process. Both cell genotypes engaged the cell wall remodeling genes in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight but with fundamentally different outcomes: the WT cells increased the expression of these genes, while the HSFA2 KO cells reduced its expression of cell wall-related genes in spaceflight relative to their terrestrially grown counterparts (see Section 2.2.1 and Section 2.2.2, Table A1, Figure 6). The WT cells enhanced the expression of a curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein (AT1G78860) that was previously identified among the secretory cell wall N-glycosylated proteins in a wall-bound extracellular matrix fraction during citrus pathogen invasion [64] and is described to be associated with cell wall structural changes and signaling upon biological attack. Also overexpressed in WT cells was an unknown protein (At4g30500) linked to the cellulose biosynthetic process and subtilase (AT1G30600), which exhibits serine-type endopeptidase activity that processes the precursor proteins of the cell wall pectin modification enzymes [65]. Contrary to WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells mostly downregulated the expression of multiple cell wall remodeling genes previously reported to be enhanced in spaceflight [14]. In spaceflight, cells in which HsfA2 was knocked out had diminished expression of cell wall loosening and cell wall elongation genes such as GASA1 (AT1G75750), endoxyloglucan transferase XTH4 (AT2G06850), EXPL1 (AT3G45970), and EXO (AT4G08950), relative to the ground control. These cells also decreased the expression level of genes associated with cell wall composition such as PMR6 (AT3G54920), which was shown to alter the composition of plant cell wall in resistance to powdery mildew pathogen, and Glycosyl hydrolase (AT5G13980), a gene shown to degrade cell wall polysaccharides [66,67]. Cell wall remodeling genes associated with developmental processes and genes related to the morphogenesis of anatomical structures also showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to its ground counterparts (see Section 2.2.2, Figure S4 drawing on the Left in the Supplementary Material). For instance, genes involved in cell elongation due to cell wall expansion such as GASA1 (At1g75750), EXLA1 (expansin-like A1, At3g45970), and GRH1 (At4g03190), a GRAS family transcription factor SCR (SCARECROW, At3g54220), which functions in asymmetric cell division, and auxin efflux carrier PIN1 (At1g73590), which is involved in the regulation of cell size, were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells that had physiologically adapted to spaceflight (see Table A1, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material) [68,69]. Additionally, 3 genes related to pollen development: 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily protein (At3g63290), ZWI ZWICHEL (At5g65930), and ATACA9, which auto inhibits Ca(2+)-ATPase 9 (At3g21180) [70,71,72], all had diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells adapted to the spaceflight environment. An essential conclusion drawn from examining the differentially expressed genes in the vertical dimension was that these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the horizontal comparison of the ground adapted states. Therefore, the way both cell genotypes modulated the expression of cell wall genes during the physiological adaptation (vertical comparison) inevitably led to substantial differences in the distinct gene expression profiles of the WT and HSFA2 KO spaceflight-adapted cells (horizontal comparison) (Section 2.3.2). Summarizing, the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight exhibited the diminished cell wall remodeling processes leading presumably to cell wall thinning compared to the ground HSFA2 KO cells, therefore supporting the potential specific HSFA2 roles in the cell wall reorganization in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state. Another specific role for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation is associated with the plasma membrane. Several genes associated with processes on the plasma membrane were differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells in spaceflight (horizontal comparison) (see Section 2.3.2, Table A2, Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material). Examples include the overexpression of membrane kinase receptors such as: Leucine-rich repeat domain protein kinase family proteins, LRKs (At5g65240, At5g25930), STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980), and BIR1 BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase (At5g48380) [73]. Membrane receptors such as these are essential for myriad processes, including sensing chemical and physical stimuli from the environment. The abundance of the receptor proteins’ presence at the membrane translates to cell’s sensitivity to the extracellular compounds binding to these receptors and it is possible that HSFA2 KO cells modulated their responsiveness by increasing the receptors expression. It is also possible that in the absence of the HSFA2, the signal transduction from the membrane receptors is altered. The directional link between the expression of the LRR-RLK genes, enhanced expression of HsfA2, and many Hsf and Hsp genes and response to the exogenously administered arsenic was found in Arabidopsis roots, suggesting that HSFA2 may have a function in the response to toxic metals in the growth medium [74]. The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight seemed to also differ from the spaceflight WT cells (horizontal comparison) in starch biosynthesis (see Section 2.3.2). Genes central to starch biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate/bisphosphoglyce PGM (At1g78050), isoamylase 1(At2g39930), and NDHN oxidoreductase (AT5G58260), were substantially underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to WT. The reports on starch content in plants in microgravity vary with the experiment and plant species [75,76,77], but it is possible that HSFA2 plays a role in the carbohydrate metabolism and energy reserve metabolic processes in microgravity that contributes to the diverse response of plants to spaceflight.3.2. HSFA2 is Much More Than a Heat Shock Factor—Things Learned from Space Although HSFA2 is part of the Heat Shock Factor network, the molecular phenotype of the HSFA2 KO in response to spaceflight shows that the gene plays an essential role in physiological adaptation that is well beyond simple thermal metabolism. Aspects of that role are revealed by examination of the gene expression differences on the ground between HSFA2 KO and WT. Disabling the expression of HsfA2 caused a change in the expression of 349 genes in the ground environment. Therefore, cells that did not express HsfA2 lacked not only one gene, but 349, as they were launched into orbit, and they all potentially contributed to the cells’ metabolic state both in the control and in the spaceflight microgravity environment. This 349-gene difference highlights the importance of recognizing the cells’ ground adapted state while looking for the differences in the tested environment which, in this study, is the environment of spaceflight. Nearly two-thirds of the genes differentially expressed between the HSFA2 KO and WT ground cells showed diminished expression in knockout cells, which could be explained by the transcription factor function of the HSFA2 (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material). The most prominent class of genes underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground as compared to the WT is associated with protein folding (Table A2; Figure S4 drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). These genes included the chaperone, co-chaperone, and no-chaperone coding genes that were reported among the critical protein folding genes in Arabidopsis [40]. Such diminished expression of some chaperone genes was in accordance with the microarray dataset obtained from the A. thaliana HSFA2 KO plants (Array Express accession number E-GEOD-4760) [78]. Additionally, plants overexpressing HsfA2 had elevated expression level of many chaperones in non-stressed conditions [79]. For instance, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HsfA2 gene overexpressed many Hsp genes, including 18 genes associated with cell rescue and virulence related genes in normal conditions [45]. The overexpression of HsfA2 increased the plant’s tolerance to combined environmental stresses, while plants with knocked out HsfA2 gene had reduced basal and acquired thermotolerance and oxidative stress tolerance [46]. These observations suggest that HSFA2 regulates the housekeeping expression of the protein folding genes not solely in response to stress. The severe underexpression of protein folding genes in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground that compromised the efficiency of the folding machinery was further manifested by the overexpression of the ER stress genes, notably 3 critical genes of the UPR involved in oxidative protein folding PDIs/ERO1 (alias ATPDIL1-2 (At1g77510), ATPDIL2-1 UNE5 (At2g47470) and AERO1 (At1g72280)). It seems that the HsfA2 mutation compromised the basic maintenance of the protein folding processes that altered the ER homeostasis and that led to ER stress. As the ER stress is a hallmark of the environmental stress response, it can further explain why the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground showed enhanced expression of abiotic stress response genes, particularly genes involved in response to drought, extreme temperature, and high salinity. The genes dehydrin (AT1G54410), a hydrophobic protein RCI2A (AT3G0588), and DREB2B (AT3G11020) were all upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells in the control, ground environment [80,81,82]. In analyzing the differentially expressed ER stress genes, it seems that if a cell experiences ER stress due to an inefficiency of the protein folding machinery resulting from its genetic background, and not the environment, the cells still send a stress-response signal cascade as they would in response to damaging exogenous or environmental stimuli and activates the stress response. Therefore, the cells actively engaging in the stress response were sent to the ISS, which could explain the hypersensitive features of the HSFA2 KO cells in the spaceflight-adapted state. HSFA2 KO underexpressed genes related to oxidative stress tolerance in the ground environment (see Table A2, Figure S4 drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). A strong link between HSFA2 and the oxidative stress response and tolerance is well established [83,84,85]. For instance, the gene At5g61640 coding PMSR1, a ubiquitous enzyme that repairs oxidatively damaged proteins, was underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground, suggesting compromised tolerance to stress at minimum oxidative stress. Fundamental metabolic processes can also be impacted by the environment; carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall remodeling are good examples of where HSFA2 plays a role these types of responses. Genes that are involved in the response to sucrose were also expressed at a lower level in HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state compared to WT. For instance, the Cold acclimation protein WCOR413 family (AT4G37220) gene, a canonical, highly sensitive sugar-repressed gene [86] was downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. In accordance, DIN3 DARK INDUCIBLE 3 (AT3G06850) and MCCB 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (AT4G34030), both mitochondrial proteins involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation during sugar starvation [87,88] were also down-regulated. Glucose level may influence protein folding, as high glucose stimulates de novo protein synthesis, making it possible that diminished gene expression of sugar-responsive genes is part of the UPR’s strategy to minimize the level of de novo protein translation and to prevent further overload of the ER folding [89]. This connection further reinforces the link between diminished carbohydrate metabolic processes and adaptation to the spaceflight environment as observed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. Cell wall remodeling is influenced by a variety of developmental and environmental cues, and it is well established that there are multiple strategies to achieve an operational goal. The extent to which HSFA2 contributes to the regulation of these strategies was revealed by comparing the expression of cell wall related genes in the HSFA2 KO to WT. It has been demonstrated in many studies that plants in space utilize genes involved in the response to pathogen attack, despite the absence of any pathogens [20]. This misconceived pathogen response could be a result of reduced gravity loading causing a distortion on the cell wall, threatening cell wall integrity similar to the physical damage that the cell wall sustains under pathogen wounding or herbivore attack. Both the WT cells and the HSFA2 KO cells differentially express cell wall-associated genes typical of pathogen attach, but not the same genes. For instance, while WT cells engaged PEN2 (AT2G44490), which triggers callose deposition in the cell wall and glucosinolate activation [90], along with two other genes (At3g43250, AT5G38980) reported to function in wounding and in defense response, the HSFA2 KO cells engaged the Disease resistance protein CC-NBS-LRR class gene (AT1G59124) [91] and NTA Seven transmembrane MLO family protein gene (AT2G17430) [92] instead. All of these genes are involved in mounting a defense in response to pathogen attack, but the gene out of this general class that is utilized depends very much on whether the genome contains an active HsfA2 gene. Thus, the differences in the cells’ physiological state on the ground dictate the requirement for molecular changes in order to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There was only one gene, At2g03760, coding brassinosteroid sulfotransferase 12 (SOT12), engaged in the same way in both genotypes during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The enhanced expression of SOT12 was correlated with actively growing cell cultures and in response to salt, osmotic stress, hormone treatments, but also in the defense response to a bacterial pathogen attack [93]. However, the physiological adaptation of the WT cells and HSFA2 KO cells shared 2 other genes, the U12-type spliceosome (At3g10400), and the Cystatin/monellin protein of unknown function (At4g03570); yet they showed an opposite change in their relative expression (see Figure 5A, Section 2.4.1). The U12 introns, although rare, are indispensable for normal growth and development of plants [94]. The U12 intron splicing is part of the non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is important for destroying transcripts with premature stop codons [95]. Interestingly, the HsfA2 transcript in its alternative form HsfA2-II is degraded via the NMD pathway [96]. Both genes showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells relative to their ground counterparts, while in the WT cells, the expression was enhanced in the respective comparison. However, both genes were overexpressed in the ground in HSFA2 KO cells compared to WT ground cells. As a result of the expression adjustments that occurred in the spaceflight cells, both genotypes achieved the matching expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. This solitary example of the two genes underlines the importance of the ground-adapted state gene expression status that mandates requirements for the gene expression changes during the physiological adaptation to the novel spaceflight environment.3.3. Role of HSFA2 in Spaceflight Adaptive Processes Comparing the gene expression profiles among space-adapted genotypes allowed the identification of the genes Required to be expressed at certain levels in order for a plant cell to adapt to spaceflight. There were genes uniquely involved in the physiological adaptation of WT cells but not in HSFA2 KO cells, as they were already expressed at a spaceflight-adapted level in HSFA2 KO on the ground (see Figure 5C, Section 2.4.1). Thus, the WT cells needed to alter the expression level of these genes from their terrestrially observed level to express them at a level required for spaceflight survival, while the HSFA2 KO cells arrived at the ISS with these genes already expressed at the required level. For instance, the PDIL1-2 (AT1G77510) gene involved in the UPR and CUL2 (At1g02980), a ubiquitin E3 ligase of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) class, was expressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground at the level required for the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3) [97]. The cullin protein is a part of a complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic turnover of proteins in a highly specific manner [98]. As mentioned above, with a change of the environment, de novo protein synthesis likely intensifies, increasing the chance for aberrant accumulation of unfolded proteins; thus, some elements of protein metabolism in the ER are indispensable to ensure proper ER homeostasis when the WT cells are exposed to a different environment. As already discussed, the HSFA2 KO cells had the UPR activated in a ground-adapted state due to inefficiency in the protein folding and, therefore, were already equipped with the correcting mechanisms when the environmental change occurred. Some other required genes were related to cell wall remodeling. For instance, a subtilase-like protein (At1g30600), with cell-wall glycoside hydrolase activity, that participates in the processing and/or turnover of cell wall proteins, was upregulated in the WT cells in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but this upregulation was not observed in HSFA2 KO cells, and the WT expression level in the spaceflight adaptive state matched that of the HSFA2 KO cells [64]. Cell wall protein degradation is likely to accompany any changes to the cell wall proteome related to cell wall remodeling; therefore, the expression of genes involved in proteolysis had to be at a specific level in spaceflight irrespective of the cell’s genetic background. Another required gene for spaceflight adaptation was the penetration 2 (PEN2) alias beta-glucosidase 26 (At2g44490) gene, which encodes glycosyl hydrolase. PEN2 was already mentioned as a component of the WT physiological adaptation and recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses by callose deposition in the cell wall [99]. The defense response was a biological process shared by WT and HSFA2 KO cells by the genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Identifying the defense response genes among the set of required genes supports the importance of this process in order for a cell to adapt to spaceflight. Using the HSFA2 KO cells allowed identification of genes with expression Corrected to the wild type levels in order for cells to adapt to spaceflight. These genes were uniquely involved in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight and did not have to be engaged in WT cells, as their expression was affected by the absence of a functional HsfA2 gene in the ground-adapted state. Thus, the WT cells did not have to make any adjustments to their expression in spaceflight; only HSFA2 KO cells had to bring the expression to a certain level and thus correct the expression level of these genes to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure 5D, Section 2.4.1). These corrected genes in the knockout cells define a new part of the overall landscape of essential genes to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state that would have been overlooked if only WT cells were used. Genes of the defense response, biotic and mechanical stimuli, and cell wall remodeling were already identified in plant wild type cells in spaceflight (see Section 3.2) [14,100,101], yet the utilization of HSFA2 KO cells provided additional insight into the repertoire of genes significant to these responses. The MLO7 Seven transmembrane MLO family protein (At2g17430), FBS1 F-box stress induced 1 (At1g61340), ILL6 IAA-leucine resistant (ILR)-like gene 6 (At1g44350), and AtPP2-A13 PP2-A13 phloem protein 2-A13 (At3g61060) are a few examples of individual genes which respond to wounding, mechanical stress, or external stimuli that had their expression level increased in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to match the WT spaceflight levels (see Table A3) [102,103,104]. Also, strictly cell wall modification genes, including PME1 pectin methylesterase 1 (At1g53840), NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein (At2g02400) that functions in lignin biosynthetic process ENODL17, and early nodulin-like protein 17 (At5g15350) associated with cell wall pectin metabolic process had their expression levels elevated in spaceflight from the level on the ground, so that it matched the WT levels in spaceflight (see Table A3). Next, genes that encode transport proteins had their expression adjusted in HSFA2 KO cells to that of WT level, so they became evenly expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state. For instance, the transmembrane transporter genes ATATH9 ABC2 homolog (At2g40090), porin (At1g50400) family protein, and GAMMA-TIP aquaporin (At2g36830) were no longer differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, as their expression was adjusted in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells (see Table A3). Similarly, nitrate transporter genes ENTH/ANTH/VHS (At4g40080) superfamily protein, and NRT2.7 (At5g14570) were also differentially expressed in spaceflight to match the WT expression levels of these genes. It is, however, uncertain how the loss of HSFA2 function was able to affect the transport of various moieties across the membrane in the ground environment, yet it seems that these transport processes had attained a particular level of efficiency for adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of several branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation enzymes, the expression levels of which were also corrected from a low level of expression to a higher level of expression in the HSFA2 KO cells when compared to the expression level in WT cells in the spaceflight environment. The dark inducible 3, DIN3 gene (At3g06850) coding the subunits of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), and two other genes important to small amino acid degradation, MCCB (At4g34030) coding for subunit β of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase participating in BCKDC reactions, and ALDH6B2 (At2g14170) methylmalonate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase (see Table A3). A large increase in BCAA accumulation can be observed due to environmental stress, such as darkness and carbohydrate starvation [88,105]. It is plausible that in the ground environment, the BCAA catabolism was reduced in the HSFA2 KO cells due to the overall problems with the cellular protein homeostasis, while the spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of BCAAs, similar to that under abiotic stress, thereby raising the demand for the BCAA degradation enzyme function. Overall, using a knockout line greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment and thereby amplifies the information gained from rare spaceflight experimentation opportunities to learn what sort of biological processes are necessary, what genes are involved in those processes, and what factors control the expression of those genes.3.4. Genotypic Adaptation to Spaceflight There were a few genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure 5E, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that without HSFA2 function, cells failed to properly regulate these genes’ expression to adapt to spaceflight, and therefore, the expression of these particular genes in the spaceflight adaptation is dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene. For instance, the WT cells increased the expression of ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase (At4g07960), suggesting a higher rate of cellulose synthesis and thus cell wall reorganization processes in spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3) [106]. Cell wall remodeling processes seemed to differ between the two genotypes, and it is possible that the increase in the cellulose synthesis in spaceflight-adapted cells somehow depends on the function of HSFA2. An alternative to the idea that genes engaged only in WT cells in spaceflight are dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene is that some of the genes engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells were only required in WT cells but not in KO cells. In other words, it was not the inability to engage these genes that excluded them from those expressed in spaceflight, but rather simply that there was no need for them. For instance, a gene coding the membrane receptor SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980) protein was downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but not in those of the HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in lower expression level in WT spaceflight-adapted state than in HSFA2 KO cells. The STRUBBELIG (SUB) receptor mediates the signaling pathway of cell morphogenesis, the orientation of plane of cellular division, and cell proliferation [107]. It is unclear why the WT cells would diminish the expression of this membrane receptor in spaceflight, yet either a function of HSFA2 is required, or an aspect of HSFA2 KO physiology makes expression of SRF5 superfluous in the spaceflight environment. There were a few genes engaged only in HSFA2 KO cells and not WT cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure 5F, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that only cells with a disabled HsfA2 gene were needed to make changes to these genes’ expression. This reflects the HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation to spaceflight environment and likely represents the genes Compensated for the loss of HSFA2 function in that environment. Among the compensating genes with enhanced expression was the aforementioned gene of the UPR: PDI-like 2-3 (At2g32920), supporting the importance of the UPR and likely the ERAD, as well as HSFA2 KO, cells in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table A3). WT cells did not need to adjust expression of these particular genes. The ATGSTU25 glutathione S-transferase TAU 25 (At1g171800) gene was another gene with enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. While genes encoding glutathione S-transferase TAU (e.g., ATGSTU1, ATGSTU3, ATGSTU24) were generally overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in either environment, the HSFA2 KO cells further elevated the expression of the glutathione S-transferase genes in spaceflight to compensate for the loss of HSFA2 function in this environment. Similarly, vesicle-mediated transporter genes were among those consistently differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT regardless of the environment, but HSFA2 KO induced additional similar genes during physiological adaptation to spaceflight and showed overexpression of such genes in the spaceflight-adapted state. Examples in this category included the Coatomer, beta’ subunit (At3g15980), Target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (At1g29060) and Integral membrane Yip1 family protein (At2g36300) genes related to ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi vesicular traffic, suggesting that these processes needed to be compensated for the lack of HSFA2’s function in the spaceflight environment. The HSFA2 KO cells decreased the expression of the two calcium pump Ca(2+)-ATPase genes, ACA9 (At3g21180), and ACA2 (At4g37640) resulting in their underexpression in the spaceflight-adapted state relative to WT cells (see Table A3). Aside from their involvement in calcium homeostasis and calcium second messenger functions, these calcium pumps were also shown to participate in protein processing in the secretory pathway [108]. Interestingly, there was another gene with the same expression profile coding, the RMR1 transmembrane receptor (At5g66160) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. The RMR1 functions as a sorting cargo receptor for protein trafficking [109]. Thus, the HSFA2 KO cell’s strategy for adapting to the spaceflight environment included reducing the protein sorting and trafficking to the destination, possibly to compensate for the basic inefficiency in these processes when the HSFA2 was disabled. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. The CEL Experiment of BRIC17 For details on the CEL experiment of BRIC17, please see [28], and Figure 1, which provides images of the BRIC Hardware and cells used in these analyses. Briefly, the CEL BRIC17 experiment was launched in the Dragon capsule of SpaceX-3 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on the 1st of March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware. The PDFU/BRIC system is a passive, air-tight, non-ventilated, non-illuminated culture system. The BRIC system is certainly not an optimal habitat for plant growth, and its limitations have been reviewed [16,110]. However, the BRIC habitat is less inimical to undifferentiated cell cultures than for photosynthetic seedlings. In addition, both spaceflight and ground control cells were each exposed to the limitations of the BRIC hardware. The spaceflight samples were launched to the ISS, while the ground controls were “launched” on a 48-h delay, and then maintained in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The 48-h delay facilitated the downlink of ISS environmental data for programming the ISSES chamber. The downlinked data included environmental conditions on the ISS that were duplicated in the ISSES. Cells were fixed within the BRIC canisters on the ISS with RNAlaterTM (Ambion) on the 10th day in orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. Twenty-four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) until the spaceflight samples were transported back to Earth, and the ground control samples were transferred to a standard laboratory −80 °C freezer. The total RNA was extracted from the spaceflight samples and the corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays. 4.2. Tissue Culture Cell Lines Arabidopsis callus cultures were established de novo, and each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were then transferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), and 2,4-D (0.5 mL/L) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lines, each of Col-0 ecotype, were the subjects of this study: wild type (WT), and a knockout line generated from the HsfA2 T-DNA insertion (SALK_008978C) (HSFA2 KO). The SALK line was obtained through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), (www.arabidopsis.org) [111].4.3. Preparation of BRIC17 CEL Cell Culture Plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were transferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 6.5 mL nutrient agar media (MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)). The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to assure sterility of both the interior and exterior of plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and then driven to KSC. The BRIC17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time. 4.4. RNA Extractions Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.5. Microarrays cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) and labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.,Redwood City, CA, USA). Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 µg/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceflight and ground control, 5 plates of WT and 3 plates of HSFA2 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 4.5.1. Microarray Data Analysis Affymetrix® Expression Console™ Software (Version 1.3) was used to generate. CEL files for each RNA hybridization. All analysis was performed in R 3.0.0 [112]. Background adjustment, summarization, and quantile normalization were performed using Limma package [113]. Normalization was made using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 normalization algorithm [114]. Data quality was assessed using the arrayQualityMetrics package and various QC charts (Density and Intensity plot, NUSE, RLE, and RNA Degradation Plot). Probes that had signals absent in all samples were removed. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from spaceflight samples was compared to the probe-set signal value of ground control samples to give gene expression ratios. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Limma package with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed with stringent criteria at P-value < 0.01, abs Fold Change > 2 (−1< FC log2 > +1; labeled as log2 Fold Change) unless stated otherwise.4.5.2. Comparison Groups The groups outlined in the concept of operations and comparisons were established and abbreviated with a combination of two capital letters and a short version of the cell line name in superscript (see Figure 2A). Letters: G—Ground Control, F—Spaceflight; Superscripts: Wt—WT cells, Hsf—HSFA2 KO cells.4.6. Functional Gene Categorization—Gene Ontology Annotations Gene function was annotated by associations of controlled vocabularies or keywords to data objects (Gene Ontology, GO). Multiple GO toolkits of this controlled vocabulary system were used to collect annotations of gene function. Various lists of gene names were created, and enrichment GO terms were searched after statistical test from pre-calculated backgrounds. All three aspects of gene products (molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location) described by GO controlled vocabularies were considered. A significance level of 0.05 and five genes as minimum number of mapping entries were implemented for the analysis parameters in the following tools: AgriGO—An integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community AgriGO was used [115]. AgriGO query criteria were as follows: Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Arabidopsis genemodel (TAIR9) precomputed background, Fisher was selected as the statistical test method of choice with the NOT-adjust multi-test adjustment method; significance level was set at 0.01 or 0.05, minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 5, plant GO slim was selected from other Gene ontology types. For Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE), the selected species was Arabidopsis thaliana, NOT-adjust was selected for multi-test adjustment method, significance level was set at 0.1, minimum number of mapping of entries was set at 10, and Plant GO slim was selected from other Gene ontology types. AmiGO—If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II—The ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes, developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabidopsis, was also used [116]. The make gene function table function was implemented to retrieve organized information on gene function (based on TAIR annotation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProfiler—A web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists was used [117]. Arabidopsis thaliana was the selected organism with most of default options except where the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR significance threshold was selected. 5. Conclusions Conclusions from these data concern non-thermal roles for the heat shock factors in the physiological adaptation of plant cells to spaceflight. First, the heat shock transcription factor HSFA2, and likely the whole HSF network, has important roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through regulation of cell wall and plasma membrane signaling, as well as starch biosynthesis. Second, disabling HsfA2 leads to activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and the unfolded protein stress response and dramatically alters adaptation to spaceflight. Without HSFA2, a much larger change in gene expression is required for spaceflight adaptation. Third, the endoplasmic reticulum and unfolded protein stress responses define the HSFA2 KO cell physiological state regardless of the environment, likely because of the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. Fourth, the HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the wild type adaptation to spaceflight by identifying a set of genes with a required expression level for a cell to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state, thus suggesting that genetic approaches provide additional insights beyond those revealed by differential gene expression in WT cells.Acknowledgments We thank the UF Space Lab members (past and present), in particular Eric R.

    "abstract": "Abstract A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring. Keywords: neutrophils, spaceflight, simulated microgravity, NLR, inflammation, oxidative stress response",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight can pose novel challenges to the health of astronauts. For instance, physiological aging occurs significantly faster as a result of spaceflight, when measured by muscle wasting, loss of bone density, and immune dysfunction (1, 2). Processes regulated by redox imbalance may contribute to these adverse outcomes (3–9). Redox imbalance results from a disproportionate increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria (10) compared to antioxidants in the cell. Elevated ROS is also a product of the oxidative burst response of neutrophils (11). In response to stimuli, terminally differentiated neutrophils in circulation become activated and engage the oxidative burst response, producing inflammatory mediators (11). If left unchecked, elevated ROS can cause cellular damage that potentiates inflammation both on Earth and during spaceflight (4, 12). Therefore, it is necessary to maintain tight regulation of the oxidative burst response to limit inflammation (13) and regulate immunity during prolonged spaceflight. Neutrophils are granulocytes that constitute approximately 50–70% of the total leukocyte population in humans. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection or injury and are typically short-lived in blood circulation under homeostatic conditions (14, 15). Lymphocytes are an important group of white blood cells involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. They constitute 20–50% of total leukocytes in circulation and consist of natural killer, natural killer T cells, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and B cells (16, 17). On Earth, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a useful biomarker to measure subclinical inflammation in humans (18). Chronic, persistent inflammation can be a major pre-existing cause of disease development (19, 20) and can be monitored by the expression of blood-based biomarkers. For example, elevated NLR predicts poor prognosis in some cancers (21–24), positively correlates with age (25), and reflects chronic stress in mice (26). Although, elevated human NLR (>3.53) (27) has been implicated in clinical settings to identify heightened inflammation (18), this biomarker has not yet been recognized for spaceflight-induced inflammation. Spaceflight raises circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts, primarily granulocytes, may reduce lymphocyte counts (12, 28, 29), and impairs immune cell functions (6, 12, 30, 31). Although, the spaceflight environment elevates circulating blood granulocytes counts in astronauts (29), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Currently, there are no well-established biomarkers for astronauts on long-duration, deep space missions, where medical intervention will be limited. Thus, identifying biomarkers to monitor in-flight astronaut health and developing countermeasures that reverse these adverse outcomes are necessary for successful future missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Therefore, we propose that an elevated NLR may be a useful prognostic indicator or diagnostic biomarker to assess astronaut immune status during long-duration missions. To test this, we analyzed both spaceflight-treated, and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated, samples to determine if NLR was elevated. Analyses of complete blood count (CBC) leukocyte differentials revealed spaceflight caused a progressive increase of granulocyte-to-lymphocyte (GLR) in astronauts and NLR in rodents. To simulate microgravity using established methods, human leukocytes were cultured in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) in vitro and mice were hindlimb unloaded (HU) in vivo (32, 33). HARV-RWV is a bioreactor allowing 3D-spatial freedom for cells and can model microgravity. It has two unique aspects similar to the spaceflight-associated microgravity environment, (1) a state of constant suspension, and (2) a quiescent surrounding without any shear or turbulent forces. Previous studies have determined leukocyte responses utilizing HARV-RWV produce similar responses as leukocytes cultured post-landing or ex vivo in flight (34–42). Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a ground-based model mimicking spaceflight-associated microgravity in rodents. The hindlimbs of rodents are elevated to produce 30–40 degree head-down tilt, inducing a cephalad fluid shift and preventing weightbearing of hindlimbs (43). The HU model can lead to immune, bone, and musculoskeletal alterations, some of which have also been observed in International Space Station (ISS) crew (44, 45). In our study, functional outputs of neutrophils in response to simulated microgravity (sµg) revealed elevated ROS and proinflammatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in activated neutrophils. Interestingly, this effect could be mitigated with antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, sµg HU wildtype (Wt) mice displayed elevated neutrophils, NLR and marginal inflammation, which was dampened in mitochondrial catalase (mCAT) transgenic mice, known to show reduced oxidative stress responses. Our findings demonstrated that, albeit distinct mechanisms, both sµg models (in vitro HARV-RWV and in vivo HU), displayed elevated oxidative stress and NLR, that could be mitigated by antioxidants. Therefore, modifying mechanisms involved in ROS-driven inflammation (46) may provide a promising avenue to limit chronic inflammation and maintain homeostatic immunity during long-duration missions.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Mouse and Human Ethics Deidentified, human buffy coat samples from healthy donors were obtained from Blood Centers of America, Oklahoma Blood Institute, and isolated on-site at NASA Ames. The use of human samples was approved by NASA Ames Institutional Review Board (IRB, 201791646CTO-02, HR-357, and HR-358) with informed consent from each blood donor. Astronaut and rodent CBC data sets were approved for use by the electronic (e)IRB/Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) advisory board (#11028), sourced from previous publications (29, 47, 48). All mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were housed in the Animal Care Facility at Ames Research Center. Hindlimb unloading and subsequent blood isolation procedures were performed following NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol (IACUC, NAS-17-001-Y2). Cell Culture Human whole blood samples were separated using centrifuge gradient Ficoll-paque Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the lymphocyte/monocyte layer and granulocyte/top red blood cell (RBC) layers were collected. Cells were RBC-lysed with 1XRBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended (5 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for subsequent assays. In Vitro Simulated Microgravity of Leukocytes Using HARV-RWV 3D high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV, Synthecon) were used to simulate microgravity with low-shear, hydrodynamic fluid flow and omni-directional gravitational force on suspended cells in rotating free-fall (34, 49–51). To optimize the measurement of oxidative stress from granulocytes in human leukocytes, suspended cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in 10 ml and rotated at 20 revolutions per minute (RPM) in a parallel-to-ground axis to simulate microgravity (sµg, omnidirectional g-force) for 20 h and controls were plated in upright T-25 flasks (1 g, unidirectional g-force). Following incubation, 1 ml of sample was collected, SYTOX™ live/dead dye-Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the sample and cells were immediately acquired on a BD FACSMelody™. Stained cells were considered dead, and cells that did not stain were considered live and were reported. For neutrophil differential experiments with antioxidant treatment, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 1 mM) was added to WBC (5 × 105 cells/ml) and cultured in HARV-RWV for 20 h, followed by flow cytometric analyses. Mouse Blood Collections Blood was collected from the vena cava on the day of euthanasia and RBC were lysed using 1XRBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Remaining WBC were fixed (2% PFA), washed in PBS, labeled with leukocyte subset markers, and analyzed by flow cytometric analyses. Flow Cytometry Staining and Methods Mouse and human blood samples were isolated, as described above, and single-cell suspensions were generated for flow cytometry acquisition. Debris was gated off and forward scatter (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A) profiled granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte populations were measured. Mouse antibodies, including anti-CD45, anti-Ly6g, and anti-CD11b, and human antibodies, including anti-CD66b, anti-CD16, anti-MPO, CellROX™, SYTOX™ live/dead stain, and active Caspase 3/7 were used to label multiple leukocyte subsets, and measure ROS formation and cellular viability. All antibodies and dyes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Unstained and single-color compensation controls were used for all flow cytometric experiments, with a minimum of 30,000 events collected/sample. All acquisitions were performed using a S3 Cell Sorter (Bio-Rad) or a BD FACSMelody™ (BD biosciences), and FlowJo (version 10.5.3) was used for data analysis. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and converted to cDNA using iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). All assays were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). An ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems) was used and threshold cycle values that were ≥35 cycles were excluded from the results. Primers were designed using BLAST and purchased from IDT with the following sequences: mouse β-Actin forward 5’-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3’ and reverse 5’-CAATAGTGATGATGACCTGGCCGT-3’, Myeloperoxidase (Mpo) forward 5’-ACCTACCCCAGTACCGATCC-3’ and reverse 5’-AACTCTCCAGCTGGCAAAAA-3’, NADPH oxidase (Nox-2, gp91phox, Cybb) forward 5’-ACTCCTTGGAGCACTGG-3’ and reverse 5’-GTTCCTGTCCAGTTGTCTTCG-3’, and Il-1β forward 5’-CCAAAGAAGAAGATGGAAAAGCG-3’ and reverse 5’-GGTGCTGATGTACCAGTTGGG-3’. Mice and Hindlimb Unloading All mice handling and experiments were performed according to the pre-approved NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were generated for experiments by breeding male, hemizyogous mCAT mice [male B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J strain] (52, 53) with female wildtype (Wt) mice (C57BL/6NJ) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6NJ Wt mice were used as controls. DNA was purified from tail snips using RedExtract-N-Amp (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) followed by genotyping using forward 5’-CTGAGGATCCTGTTAAACAATGC-3’ and reverse 5’-CTATCTGTTCAACCTCAGCAAAG-3’ (54) primers for the mCAT gene. For HU experiments, female mice were acclimated to their assigned cages three days prior to the onset of HU. Animals were 16-weeks of age at the beginning of HU. For the 14-day HU study, C57BL/6NJ Wt female mice were assigned to one of two treatments: normally loaded (NL) controls, singly housed in standard vivarium cages or HU. For the 30-day HU experiment, mice were assigned to one of four groups: Wt/NL, Wt/HU, mCAT/NL, or mCAT/HU. In both 14- and 30-day HU studies, mice were housed under 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle conditions and provided cotton nestlets (Ancare, NES3600) as enrichment. Nestlets were refreshed daily. Ambient temperature ranged from 23.3 to 25.6°C. Body weights were monitored every 2–3 days throughout the experiment. Blood draws were performed at euthanasia on days 14 or 30 (32). Statistical Analyses Data were compared with either paired or unpaired, nonparametric or parametric analyses, or with one- or two-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were supported by a trained statistician.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight Elevates NLR and GLR Peripheral WBC data from previously space-flown rodent and astronaut experiments were re-analyzed to determine the contribution of spaceflight to NLR and GLR immune profile shifts. In rodents (47, 48), spaceflight increased NLR after 14 days in-flight and immediately post-landing ( Figure 1A ). Later post-flight (2–8 days after landing, R+2 to R+8), NLR decreased relative to flight (F14) and landing (R+0) values, suggesting a re-adaptation response to Earth’s 1 gravity (1 g) ( Figure 1A ). Retrospective GLR data were not recorded for this spaceflight mission. Human WBC data (29) were re-analyzed and GLR was elevated after 180 days on-orbit (late) and in samples collected within 2–3 hours post-landing (R+0) ( Figure 1B ). Later post-flight (30-day, R+30), GLR recovered to pre-flight baseline levels (L-180). Retrospective NLR data were not recorded for this mission. Thus, a progressive increase in NLR and GLR occurred in-flight and immediately post-landing in rodents and humans, suggesting NLR may be a useful biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status.

Error bars denote standard error of mean. HARV-RWV sµg Elevates NLR in Human Leukocytes In Vitro Due to the constraints of conducting spaceflight experiments, we further confirmed these results using an in vitro sµg model. For this, human WBC were cultured in HARV-RWV sµg for 20 h. Flow cytometry showed sµg increased granulocyte percentage (%) and absolute counts, reduced lymphocyte and monocyte %, and although not statistically significant, a reduced trend in absolute counts (forward scatter area, FSC-A versus side scatter area, SSC-A) ( Figures 2A, B , and Figure S1A ), and increased GLR ( Figure 2C ). To determine if altered GLR was due to elevated survival of granulocytes or increased death of lymphocytes, active Caspase 3/7 staining was performed, which indicated elevated lymphocyte apoptosis in sµg ( Figures 2D, E ). To characterize human neutrophil populations within the WBC pool following sµg, cell surface markers CD66b+ and CD16+ were used (55–58), which displayed elevated neutrophils ( Figure 2F ) and elevated NLR ( Figure 2G ). Collectively, these findings confirm the utility of NLR as a biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status. Figure 2. Open in a new tab HARV-RWV sµg elevates GLR and NLR. (A) Flow scatter plot: G, Granulocyte; M, Monocyte; L, Lymphocytes. (B) Percent (%) live population of each cell type (n = 37–42). (C) GLR based on % population of each cell type (n = 37–42).

A non-parametric, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test compared to 1 g was performed for sµg leukocyte differential analyses and GLR/NLR determination. A * indicates p < 0.05 and error bars denote standard error of mean. HARV-RWV sµg Elevates ROS and Activates Neutrophils, While the Antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine Ameliorates This Effect Elevated percentage and absolute count of granulocytes within WBC ( Figures 2A, B , and Figure S1A ) were observed in sµg, with no difference in apoptosis ( Figures 2D, E ). Elevated percentage of neutrophils within WBC ( Figure 2F ) were also observed in sµg. Since mature granulocytes, including neutrophils, in blood are non-proliferating, terminally differentiated cells, elevated percentages may be due to differential light scatter properties, indicative of cellular activation. CD66b not only serves as a marker for human neutrophils, but its cell surface expression level per cell is also elevated in activated neutrophils (58, 59). Therefore, we sought to determine if sµg can activate neutrophils. We found sµg resulted in elevated cell surface receptor median fluorescence intensity (MFI) expression of CD66b per granulocyte, with no difference in CD16 MFI ( Figures 3A, B ), suggesting neutrophil activation during sµg. We further confirmed neutrophil activation by uncovering elevated cell surface receptor CD11b median fluorescence intensity (MFI) within CD16+CD66b+ granulocytes ( Figures S1B, C ). Activated neutrophils also express elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) during the oxidative burst response (11, 60–62). Furthermore, spaceflight and analog models on Earth (4–9, 63) can promote redox imbalance, triggering cellular damage and persistent inflammation (12). We found ROS (via mean fluorescence intensity, or MFI) per granulocyte and MPO (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) per neutrophil, were both elevated in sµg, collectively suggesting sµg caused neutrophil activation ( Figures 3C, E ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab HARV-RWV sµg activates neutrophils to produce ROS and MPO, while antioxidant treatment ameliorates this effect.

(D) Representative flow histogram plot of MPO mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). (E) MPO MFI per neutrophil (CD66b+CD16+) in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 1 mM, n = 10–24). All experiments were repeated at least twice. A non-parametric, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test compared to 1g or control groups, a * indicates p < 0.05, a # indicates the positive control with a p<0.05 compared to 1g. Error bars denote standard error of mean. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that scavenges free radicals, promotes glutathione biosynthesis, and decreases mitochondrial membrane depolarization (64). To assess the effects of NAC on neutrophil activation we cultured WBCs in the presence or absence of NAC (1 mM) under sµg for 20 h. The results showed reduced expression of MPO in the presence of NAC ( Figures 3D, E ), suggesting antioxidant treatment ameliorates sµg induced neutrophil activation, thus serving as a promising countermeasure to suppress spaceflight-induced inflammation. Hindlimb Unloading (14-day) sμg Increases Circulating Blood Neutrophils and Elevates NLR In Vivo To test the effects of sµg on immunity in an in vivo model (32), blood was collected from wildtype HU (Wt/HU) mice following 14 days of HU. Cells were immunoprofiled to determine neutrophil counts and NLR in circulating blood. Ly6g is a ubiquitous cell surface marker in mice used to distinguish eosinophils/myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Ly6glow) from neutrophils (Ly6ghigh) (65) ( Figure 4A ). Compared to normally loaded (NL) controls, no difference was observed in eosinophil/myeloid-derived suppressor cell % ( Figure 4B ) and absolute counts ( Figure S2A ) populations, while increased % ( Figure 4C ) and absolute counts ( Figure S2B ) of neutrophils were observed in HU. No difference in lymphocyte % ( Figure 4D ) or absolute counts ( Figure S2C ) were noted in the in vivo HU model, in contrast with the reduced lymphocytes % observed in vitro HARV-RWV sµg-treated leukocytes ( Figure 2B ) with increased apoptosis of lymphocytes. No significant differences were observed with monocyte % or absolute counts ( Figures S2D, E ). However, significantly elevated NLR was observed following 14 days of HU ( Figure 4E ). Therefore, HU (14-day) displayed elevated NLR values as observed previously with rodents and humans in spaceflight and sµg experiments, confirming elevated NLR in multiple reduced gravity models, albeit produced via potentially different mechanisms. Figure 4. Open in a new tab 14-day HU sµg increases number of circulating blood neutrophils and elevates NLR. Blood from HU and NL (14-day) Wt mice.

Prolonged Hindlimb Unloading (30-day) sµg Results in Elevated Blood Neutrophil Persistence and NLR, While This Effect is Mitigated in mCAT Mice Elevated neutrophil numbers and persistence in blood circulation result in tissue damage and impaired immune responses (66). HU also induces redox imbalance (8). Therefore, we compared the effects of prolonged HU (30-day) in Wt mice with transgenic mice expressing human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT) (54). Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that converts reactive hydrogen peroxide into non-reactive water and oxygen, a cellular antioxidant mechanism that restores redox balance. Comparable to 14-day HU, 30-day HU in Wt mice resulted in elevated neutrophils, no significant difference in lymphocytes, and an elevated NLR, while these results were mitigated in mCAT/HU mice ( Figures 5A–C and Figure S3 ). Oxidative stress and inflammatory gene expression in Wt and mCAT mice were assessed by qPCR. Compared to Wt/NL controls, Mpo (p = 0.0240*) was increased in Wt/HU ( Figure 5D ), while a non-significant elevation in NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox-2, p = 0.6411) and Il-1β (p = 0.1349) were also observed ( Figures 5E, F ). On the other hand, mCAT/HU mice partially mitigated some of these effects ( Figures 5D–F ). Collectively, prolonged HU (30-days) induced persistent NLR, oxidative stress and marginal inflammation, while catalase overexpression mitigated some of these outcomes. Figure 5. Open in a new tab 30-day HU sµg results in elevated blood neutrophil persistence and NLR with this effect mitigated in mCAT mice.

A two-way ANOVA and a non-parametric, Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was performed between groups, a * indicates p < 0.05. Error bars denote standard error of mean.Collectively, our findings demonstrated that, through potentially different mechanisms, both spaceflight and multiple sµg models elevated NLR, ROS, and MPO inflammation, while antioxidants mitigated some of these outcomes. Therefore, elevated NLR may be a suitable prognostic biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status and inflammation during long-duration missions.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight causes immune dysfunction that can lead to health risks for astronauts. Health risks that arise from immune dysfunction are complex and include an inability to defend against pathogens, altered tolerance to self-antigens resulting in potential autoimmunity development, chronic inflammation, and immune senescence. Therefore, mitigation during spaceflight will likely require selective targeting of specific immune cell types and/or developmental stages. Elevated NLR may be a prospective biomarker candidate to identify immune deviations that can cause disease. Currently, elevated NLR is used as a clinical biomarker to detect sub-clinical inflammation in humans and predicts poor prognosis in cancer (18). In this study, a spike in GLR in humans and NLR in rodents was observed at landing and elevated GLR and NLR were observed during spaceflight ( Figure 1 ). In humans, GLR was elevated at 180-days in-flight, suggesting prolonged exposure to spaceflight caused leukocyte differential changes. This change in immune differentials may be in response to elevated inflammation experienced in-flight (4, 6, 12), since elevated, chronic inflammation is often coupled with immune dysfunction and disease development (13, 19, 20, 67–70). Therefore, monitoring distinct biomarkers, such as elevated NLR, can determine when countermeasures can intervene to avert immune dysfunction, promote immune recovery, and prevent disease development. Elevated numbers of granulocytes and neutrophils were observed in vitro following 20 h of HARV-RWV modeled microgravity in human peripheral blood ( Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). However, since mature neutrophils are terminally differentiated in blood circulation, i.e., banded or segmented neutrophils, we estimate that this increased percentage is due to increased scatter properties indicative of cellular activation. Indeed, elevated cell surface expression of CD66b and CD11b per granulocyte, which are activation markers for neutrophils (58, 59), were increased in sµg ( Figure 3 and Figure S1 ). Further studies revealed elevated ROS and MPO expression ( Figure 3 ), confirming HARV-RWV sµg resulted in granulocytes, and in particular, neutrophil activation. Physiological effects of elevated active granulocytes or neutrophils in circulation intensifies sterile inflammation (70–72), promotes edema, and non-specific tissue damage (73), and can threaten astronaut health if not adequately controlled. Interestingly, MPO gene expression ( Figure 5D ) was elevated in HU, suggesting immature neutrophil entry into blood circulation, compared to neutrophil activation observed in vitro in the HARV-RWV. MPO gene synthesis only occurs in bone marrow early in neutrophil development, i.e. immature neutrophils (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes). MPO gene expression ends once neutrophils differentiate into metamyelocytes (74) and synthesized MPO protein is packaged into granules released during neutrophil activation (75). Typically, immature neutrophils are not released into blood circulation unless the body is in a diseased or inflammatory state (74, 75). However, since MPO gene expression was elevated in HU mice blood, this suggests the potential for myelocyte/immature neutrophil infiltration and may also serve as a biomarker for elevated inflammation during spaceflight. To our knowledge no measurements have been recorded for elevated immature neutrophils in blood circulation in-flight; however, elevated neutrophils were identified in blood from 9 of 16 astronauts at landing (6, 76, 77). As compared to the rodent spaceflight results (in-flight day 14), elevated neutrophils were also observed at days 14 and 30 of HU in mice ( Figures 4C and 5A ), suggesting the physical effects of fluid-shifting experienced during spaceflight and HU may stimulate the release of neutrophils into circulation; however this requires further investigation. Indeed, elevated MPO during sµg may contribute to immune dysfunction. MPO catalyzes hydrogen peroxide into reactive intermediates that can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA (67). Excess MPO impairs phagocytic function (67–69) and triggers neutrophil degranulation, causing inflammatory tissue damage (78) in cardiovascular disease (62, 67, 79). Pathologically this is relevant during spaceflight, as cardiovascular disease is a prominent risk factor associated with returned astronauts (80). Furthermore, elevated NLR is currently used as a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk on Earth (81), thereby highlighting the clinical relevance of monitoring NLR during spaceflight. Neutrophil oxidative burst responses and elevated ROS can induce cellular death (82), including lymphocyte apoptosis (83), and suppression of T lymphocyte function (84). HARV-RWV sµg induced ROS in granulocytes, indicating HARV-RWV sµg activated granulocytes and triggered the oxidative burst response. Thus HARV-RWV sµg can serve as a valuable model to study ROS-induced inflammation (72, 85). Indeed, redox imbalance occurs in humans and cell cultures exposed to spaceflight (4–6) and in vitro ground-based sµg models (8, 9, 86). The cause of elevated ROS in sµg may be due to: (1) cell death factors or other unknown stimulators of the oxidative burst response, (2) a mechanosensitive stress receptor in phagocytes that triggers redox imbalance (87), and/or (3) a combination of these effects. In our study, HARV-RWV sµg induced active Caspase 3/7 expression in lymphocyte populations ( Figure 2D ), indicating lymphocyte apoptosis and shifting of immune differentials to favor higher NLR and GLR. Further analyses of our in vivo HU studies revealed no difference in lymphocyte percent or absolute count populations ( Figures 4 and 5 , and Figures S2 and 3 ) compared to HARV-RWV sµg studies, suggesting elevated lymphocyte recovery or unknown ROS-quenching mechanisms that limit lymphocyte apoptosis, both of which require further studies. Therefore, the two sµg models, HARV-RWV and HU, displayed different mechanisms towards generating an elevated NLR. The HARV-RWV microgravity model appears to display robust lymphocyte turnover, i.e. elevated lymphocyte apoptosis, and most likely immune function that may differ from astronauts in-flight. However, this does not rule out that lymphocyte apoptosis does not occur in vivo HU, as turnover of lymphocytes to replace loss most likely occurs, albeit apoptosis may occur at a slower rate than in vitro HARV-RWV. Furthermore, ROS concentration within each sµg model may be drastically different. For example, ROS levels in HARV-RWV may be much higher in the absence of in vivo ROS quenchers compared to 14- or 30-day HU, which would affect the rate of lymphocyte apoptosis (88, 89). Indeed, concentration and exposure time of ROS determines cellular responses. Homeostatic levels of ROS can promote cell survival, while elevated ROS (oxidative stress) can induce cellular death (82). In line with this, the timeline of measurements of lymphocyte counts (20 h HARV-RWV versus 14- and 30-days HU) differ between the two models; therefore direct comparisons cannot be assumed. Finally, the HARV-RWV model cultured human blood samples, which have different leukocyte percentages compared to mice leukocytes in the HU model; therefore the kinetics of apoptosis across the two microgravity models would also be affected. Crucian et al. showed there is an elevation of granulocytes in blood circulation, while no differences are observed in lymphocyte absolute counts, suggesting lymphocytes may not undergo apoptosis in spaceflight; rather there may be release of more granulocytes into blood circulation (29). Controversially however, multiple reports have indicated lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cell lines undergo apoptosis during spaceflight/microgravity conditions (36–42), albeit measurements were either reported post-landing or from ex vivo cell cultures in flight. In fact, the role of apoptosis in lymphocyte depression (ROALD) experiment that was part of the BIO-4 mission and comprised of ESA, Energia, and NASA agencies, was performed with the goal to understand how microgravity affects lymphocyte apoptosis. The results showed after 48 h on-board the ISS ex vivo cultures of lymphocytes displayed increased DNA fragmentation, PARP protein expression, and elevated p53 expression, compared to ground controls (36). Due to this, we believe the in vivo HU microgravity model, although having its own limitations, may be a better representative ground-based model for spaceflight. Nonetheless, additional studies are required to better understand the degree of lymphocyte turnover during in vivo HU that is comparable to spaceflight. Monocytes were significantly reduced following HARV-RWV ( Figure 2B ); however no differences were observed in HU mice ( Figures S2D, E ), further indicating the variability between the two simulated microgravity models. Yet, inconsistency with these cell types in terms of population differentials have also been noted across spaceflight literature (77, 90, 91), which may be a factor of sampling timepoints. However, consensus suggests phagocytic function of monocytes following spaceflight is impaired (92, 93). Phagocytic impairment of monocytes can directly affect clearance of neutrophils from circulation, inflammation resolution (94), and can impact NLR. Therefore, further research into the function and distribution of monocytes following simulated microgravity are currently underway. Transgenic mice expressing the human antioxidant gene catalase reversed HU-induced elevation of NLR and dampened inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 5 ), suggesting redox imbalance caused leukocyte differential changes. In line with this, mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein with antioxidant activity, display elevated ROS expression and activated neutrophils (95). In our study, HARV-RWV sµg of human leukocytes induced neutrophil activation that was reversed in the presence of the antioxidant NAC ( Figure 3D ), further suggesting antioxidants can suppress inflammation. Indeed, in vivo NAC treatment successfully ameliorated acetic acid-induced colitis by reversing pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and MPO in rats (96). Collectively, these results indicate antioxidants as viable countermeasures to regulate spaceflight-induced inflammation and immune dysfunction. Clinically, elevated NLR (>3.53) (27) is a prognostic indicator for cancer development, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and infectious conditions (18, 21–23, 25), but no NLR standard has been established for astronaut immunity. Our results revealed elevated GLR in astronauts at landing (GLR = 3.6, Figure 1B ), compared to clinically relevant GLR (>2.24) (97), may result in biological significance for astronaut health. Although restoration to normal GLR occurred at landing on Earth, landing on the lunar surface and/or Mars, where gravity is less than Earth’s, may pose a significant risk to astronaut immune recovery. Therefore, monitoring and developing countermeasures to mitigate elevated NLR, GLR, and inflammatory neutrophil phenotypes for future long-duration and long-distance space travel are essential for mission success. In summary, we identified increased GLR and NLR in both human and rodent spaceflight samples and ground simulations of microgravity. Our results in vitro indicated that leukocytes shift in favor of elevated activated inflammatory neutrophils, which may amplify disease development in vivo. Further, antioxidants may be useful countermeasures to ameliorate these outcomes in sµg, as NAC treatment inhibited activated inflammatory human neutrophils in HARV-RWV and catalase partially mitigated elevated NLR in HU mice. Based on these findings, we suggest monitoring both in-flight and landing NLR to assess astronaut immune status. We further advocate the investigation of antioxidants as future countermeasures to mitigate immune deviations, including elevated NLR and inflammation, to safeguard astronaut health on future missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 7667275 PMID: 33224136 Abstract A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring. Keywords: neutrophils, spaceflight, simulated microgravity, NLR, inflammation, oxidative stress responseIntroduction Spaceflight can pose novel challenges to the health of astronauts. For instance, physiological aging occurs significantly faster as a result of spaceflight, when measured by muscle wasting, loss of bone density, and immune dysfunction (1, 2). Processes regulated by redox imbalance may contribute to these adverse outcomes (3–9). Redox imbalance results from a disproportionate increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria (10) compared to antioxidants in the cell. Elevated ROS is also a product of the oxidative burst response of neutrophils (11). In response to stimuli, terminally differentiated neutrophils in circulation become activated and engage the oxidative burst response, producing inflammatory mediators (11). If left unchecked, elevated ROS can cause cellular damage that potentiates inflammation both on Earth and during spaceflight (4, 12). Therefore, it is necessary to maintain tight regulation of the oxidative burst response to limit inflammation (13) and regulate immunity during prolonged spaceflight. Neutrophils are granulocytes that constitute approximately 50–70% of the total leukocyte population in humans. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection or injury and are typically short-lived in blood circulation under homeostatic conditions (14, 15). Lymphocytes are an important group of white blood cells involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. They constitute 20–50% of total leukocytes in circulation and consist of natural killer, natural killer T cells, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and B cells (16, 17). On Earth, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a useful biomarker to measure subclinical inflammation in humans (18). Chronic, persistent inflammation can be a major pre-existing cause of disease development (19, 20) and can be monitored by the expression of blood-based biomarkers. For example, elevated NLR predicts poor prognosis in some cancers (21–24), positively correlates with age (25), and reflects chronic stress in mice (26). Although, elevated human NLR (>3.53) (27) has been implicated in clinical settings to identify heightened inflammation (18), this biomarker has not yet been recognized for spaceflight-induced inflammation. Spaceflight raises circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts, primarily granulocytes, may reduce lymphocyte counts (12, 28, 29), and impairs immune cell functions (6, 12, 30, 31). Although, the spaceflight environment elevates circulating blood granulocytes counts in astronauts (29), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Currently, there are no well-established biomarkers for astronauts on long-duration, deep space missions, where medical intervention will be limited. Thus, identifying biomarkers to monitor in-flight astronaut health and developing countermeasures that reverse these adverse outcomes are necessary for successful future missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Therefore, we propose that an elevated NLR may be a useful prognostic indicator or diagnostic biomarker to assess astronaut immune status during long-duration missions. To test this, we analyzed both spaceflight-treated, and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated, samples to determine if NLR was elevated. Analyses of complete blood count (CBC) leukocyte differentials revealed spaceflight caused a progressive increase of granulocyte-to-lymphocyte (GLR) in astronauts and NLR in rodents. To simulate microgravity using established methods, human leukocytes were cultured in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) in vitro and mice were hindlimb unloaded (HU) in vivo (32, 33). HARV-RWV is a bioreactor allowing 3D-spatial freedom for cells and can model microgravity. It has two unique aspects similar to the spaceflight-associated microgravity environment, (1) a state of constant suspension, and (2) a quiescent surrounding without any shear or turbulent forces. Previous studies have determined leukocyte responses utilizing HARV-RWV produce similar responses as leukocytes cultured post-landing or ex vivo in flight (34–42). Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a ground-based model mimicking spaceflight-associated microgravity in rodents. The hindlimbs of rodents are elevated to produce 30–40 degree head-down tilt, inducing a cephalad fluid shift and preventing weightbearing of hindlimbs (43). The HU model can lead to immune, bone, and musculoskeletal alterations, some of which have also been observed in International Space Station (ISS) crew (44, 45). In our study, functional outputs of neutrophils in response to simulated microgravity (sµg) revealed elevated ROS and proinflammatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in activated neutrophils. Interestingly, this effect could be mitigated with antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, sµg HU wildtype (Wt) mice displayed elevated neutrophils, NLR and marginal inflammation, which was dampened in mitochondrial catalase (mCAT) transgenic mice, known to show reduced oxidative stress responses. Our findings demonstrated that, albeit distinct mechanisms, both sµg models (in vitro HARV-RWV and in vivo HU), displayed elevated oxidative stress and NLR, that could be mitigated by antioxidants. Therefore, modifying mechanisms involved in ROS-driven inflammation (46) may provide a promising avenue to limit chronic inflammation and maintain homeostatic immunity during long-duration missions.Materials and Methods Mouse and Human Ethics Deidentified, human buffy coat samples from healthy donors were obtained from Blood Centers of America, Oklahoma Blood Institute, and isolated on-site at NASA Ames. The use of human samples was approved by NASA Ames Institutional Review Board (IRB, 201791646CTO-02, HR-357, and HR-358) with informed consent from each blood donor. Astronaut and rodent CBC data sets were approved for use by the electronic (e)IRB/Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) advisory board (#11028), sourced from previous publications (29, 47, 48). All mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were housed in the Animal Care Facility at Ames Research Center. Hindlimb unloading and subsequent blood isolation procedures were performed following NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol (IACUC, NAS-17-001-Y2).Cell Culture Human whole blood samples were separated using centrifuge gradient Ficoll-paque Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the lymphocyte/monocyte layer and granulocyte/top red blood cell (RBC) layers were collected. Cells were RBC-lysed with 1XRBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended (5 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for subsequent assays. In Vitro Simulated Microgravity of Leukocytes Using HARV-RWV 3D high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV, Synthecon) were used to simulate microgravity with low-shear, hydrodynamic fluid flow and omni-directional gravitational force on suspended cells in rotating free-fall (34, 49–51). To optimize the measurement of oxidative stress from granulocytes in human leukocytes, suspended cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in 10 ml and rotated at 20 revolutions per minute (RPM) in a parallel-to-ground axis to simulate microgravity (sµg, omnidirectional g-force) for 20 h and controls were plated in upright T-25 flasks (1 g, unidirectional g-force). Following incubation, 1 ml of sample was collected, SYTOX™ live/dead dye-Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the sample and cells were immediately acquired on a BD FACSMelody™. Stained cells were considered dead, and cells that did not stain were considered live and were reported. For neutrophil differential experiments with antioxidant treatment, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 1 mM) was added to WBC (5 × 105 cells/ml) and cultured in HARV-RWV for 20 h, followed by flow cytometric analyses.Mouse Blood Collections Blood was collected from the vena cava on the day of euthanasia and RBC were lysed using 1XRBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Remaining WBC were fixed (2% PFA), washed in PBS, labeled with leukocyte subset markers, and analyzed by flow cytometric analyses.Flow Cytometry Staining and Methods Mouse and human blood samples were isolated, as described above, and single-cell suspensions were generated for flow cytometry acquisition. Debris was gated off and forward scatter (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A) profiled granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte populations were measured. Mouse antibodies, including anti-CD45, anti-Ly6g, and anti-CD11b, and human antibodies, including anti-CD66b, anti-CD16, anti-MPO, CellROX™, SYTOX™ live/dead stain, and active Caspase 3/7 were used to label multiple leukocyte subsets, and measure ROS formation and cellular viability. All antibodies and dyes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Unstained and single-color compensation controls were used for all flow cytometric experiments, with a minimum of 30,000 events collected/sample. All acquisitions were performed using a S3 Cell Sorter (Bio-Rad) or a BD FACSMelody™ (BD biosciences), and FlowJo (version 10.5.3) was used for data analysis.Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and converted to cDNA using iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). All assays were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). An ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems) was used and threshold cycle values that were ≥35 cycles were excluded from the results. Primers were designed using BLAST and purchased from IDT with the following sequences: mouse β-Actin forward 5’-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3’ and reverse 5’-CAATAGTGATGATGACCTGGCCGT-3’, Myeloperoxidase (Mpo) forward 5’-ACCTACCCCAGTACCGATCC-3’ and reverse 5’-AACTCTCCAGCTGGCAAAAA-3’, NADPH oxidase (Nox-2, gp91phox, Cybb) forward 5’-ACTCCTTGGAGCACTGG-3’ and reverse 5’-GTTCCTGTCCAGTTGTCTTCG-3’, and Il-1β forward 5’-CCAAAGAAGAAGATGGAAAAGCG-3’ and reverse 5’-GGTGCTGATGTACCAGTTGGG-3’.Mice and Hindlimb Unloading All mice handling and experiments were performed according to the pre-approved NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were generated for experiments by breeding male, hemizyogous mCAT mice [male B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J strain] (52, 53) with female wildtype (Wt) mice (C57BL/6NJ) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6NJ Wt mice were used as controls. DNA was purified from tail snips using RedExtract-N-Amp (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) followed by genotyping using forward 5’-CTGAGGATCCTGTTAAACAATGC-3’ and reverse 5’-CTATCTGTTCAACCTCAGCAAAG-3’ (54) primers for the mCAT gene. For HU experiments, female mice were acclimated to their assigned cages three days prior to the onset of HU. Animals were 16-weeks of age at the beginning of HU. For the 14-day HU study, C57BL/6NJ Wt female mice were assigned to one of two treatments: normally loaded (NL) controls, singly housed in standard vivarium cages or HU. For the 30-day HU experiment, mice were assigned to one of four groups: Wt/NL, Wt/HU, mCAT/NL, or mCAT/HU. In both 14- and 30-day HU studies, mice were housed under 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle conditions and provided cotton nestlets (Ancare, NES3600) as enrichment. Nestlets were refreshed daily. Ambient temperature ranged from 23.3 to 25.6°C. Body weights were monitored every 2–3 days throughout the experiment. Blood draws were performed at euthanasia on days 14 or 30 (32).Statistical Analyses Data were compared with either paired or unpaired, nonparametric or parametric analyses, or with one- or two-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were supported by a trained statistician.Results Spaceflight Elevates NLR and GLR Peripheral WBC data from previously space-flown rodent and astronaut experiments were re-analyzed to determine the contribution of spaceflight to NLR and GLR immune profile shifts. In rodents (47, 48), spaceflight increased NLR after 14 days in-flight and immediately post-landing ( Figure 1A ). Later post-flight (2–8 days after landing, R+2 to R+8), NLR decreased relative to flight (F14) and landing (R+0) values, suggesting a re-adaptation response to Earth’s 1 gravity (1 g) ( Figure 1A ). Retrospective GLR data were not recorded for this spaceflight mission. Human WBC data (29) were re-analyzed and GLR was elevated after 180 days on-orbit (late) and in samples collected within 2–3 hours post-landing (R+0) ( Figure 1B ). Later post-flight (30-day, R+30), GLR recovered to pre-flight baseline levels (L-180). Retrospective NLR data were not recorded for this mission. Thus, a progressive increase in NLR and GLR occurred in-flight and immediately post-landing in rodents and humans, suggesting NLR may be a useful biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status.

Error bars denote standard error of mean.HARV-RWV sµg Elevates NLR in Human Leukocytes In Vitro Due to the constraints of conducting spaceflight experiments, we further confirmed these results using an in vitro sµg model. For this, human WBC were cultured in HARV-RWV sµg for 20 h. Flow cytometry showed sµg increased granulocyte percentage (%) and absolute counts, reduced lymphocyte and monocyte %, and although not statistically significant, a reduced trend in absolute counts (forward scatter area, FSC-A versus side scatter area, SSC-A) ( Figures 2A, B , and Figure S1A ), and increased GLR ( Figure 2C ). To determine if altered GLR was due to elevated survival of granulocytes or increased death of lymphocytes, active Caspase 3/7 staining was performed, which indicated elevated lymphocyte apoptosis in sµg ( Figures 2D, E ). To characterize human neutrophil populations within the WBC pool following sµg, cell surface markers CD66b+ and CD16+ were used (55–58), which displayed elevated neutrophils ( Figure 2F ) and elevated NLR ( Figure 2G ). Collectively, these findings confirm the utility of NLR as a biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status. Figure 2. Open in a new tab HARV-RWV sµg elevates GLR and NLR.

A non-parametric, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test compared to 1 g was performed for sµg leukocyte differential analyses and GLR/NLR determination. A * indicates p < 0.05 and error bars denote standard error of mean.HARV-RWV sµg Elevates ROS and Activates Neutrophils, While the Antioxidant N-Acetyl Cysteine Ameliorates This Effect Elevated percentage and absolute count of granulocytes within WBC ( Figures 2A, B , and Figure S1A ) were observed in sµg, with no difference in apoptosis ( Figures 2D, E ). Elevated percentage of neutrophils within WBC ( Figure 2F ) were also observed in sµg. Since mature granulocytes, including neutrophils, in blood are non-proliferating, terminally differentiated cells, elevated percentages may be due to differential light scatter properties, indicative of cellular activation. CD66b not only serves as a marker for human neutrophils, but its cell surface expression level per cell is also elevated in activated neutrophils (58, 59). Therefore, we sought to determine if sµg can activate neutrophils. We found sµg resulted in elevated cell surface receptor median fluorescence intensity (MFI) expression of CD66b per granulocyte, with no difference in CD16 MFI ( Figures 3A, B ), suggesting neutrophil activation during sµg. We further confirmed neutrophil activation by uncovering elevated cell surface receptor CD11b median fluorescence intensity (MFI) within CD16+CD66b+ granulocytes ( Figures S1B, C ). Activated neutrophils also express elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) during the oxidative burst response (11, 60–62). Furthermore, spaceflight and analog models on Earth (4–9, 63) can promote redox imbalance, triggering cellular damage and persistent inflammation (12). We found ROS (via mean fluorescence intensity, or MFI) per granulocyte and MPO (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) per neutrophil, were both elevated in sµg, collectively suggesting sµg caused neutrophil activation ( Figures 3C, E ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab HARV-RWV sµg activates neutrophils to produce ROS and MPO, while antioxidant treatment ameliorates this effect.

(D) Representative flow histogram plot of MPO mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). (E) MPO MFI per neutrophil (CD66b+CD16+) in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 1 mM, n = 10–24). All experiments were repeated at least twice. A non-parametric, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test compared to 1g or control groups, a * indicates p < 0.05, a # indicates the positive control with a p<0.05 compared to 1g. Error bars denote standard error of mean. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that scavenges free radicals, promotes glutathione biosynthesis, and decreases mitochondrial membrane depolarization (64). To assess the effects of NAC on neutrophil activation we cultured WBCs in the presence or absence of NAC (1 mM) under sµg for 20 h. The results showed reduced expression of MPO in the presence of NAC ( Figures 3D, E ), suggesting antioxidant treatment ameliorates sµg induced neutrophil activation, thus serving as a promising countermeasure to suppress spaceflight-induced inflammation.Hindlimb Unloading (14-day) sμg Increases Circulating Blood Neutrophils and Elevates NLR In Vivo To test the effects of sµg on immunity in an in vivo model (32), blood was collected from wildtype HU (Wt/HU) mice following 14 days of HU. Cells were immunoprofiled to determine neutrophil counts and NLR in circulating blood. Ly6g is a ubiquitous cell surface marker in mice used to distinguish eosinophils/myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Ly6glow) from neutrophils (Ly6ghigh) (65) ( Figure 4A ). Compared to normally loaded (NL) controls, no difference was observed in eosinophil/myeloid-derived suppressor cell % ( Figure 4B ) and absolute counts ( Figure S2A ) populations, while increased % ( Figure 4C ) and absolute counts ( Figure S2B ) of neutrophils were observed in HU. No difference in lymphocyte % ( Figure 4D ) or absolute counts ( Figure S2C ) were noted in the in vivo HU model, in contrast with the reduced lymphocytes % observed in vitro HARV-RWV sµg-treated leukocytes ( Figure 2B ) with increased apoptosis of lymphocytes. No significant differences were observed with monocyte % or absolute counts ( Figures S2D, E ). However, significantly elevated NLR was observed following 14 days of HU ( Figure 4E ). Therefore, HU (14-day) displayed elevated NLR values as observed previously with rodents and humans in spaceflight and sµg experiments, confirming elevated NLR in multiple reduced gravity models, albeit produced via potentially different mechanisms. Figure 4. Open in a new tab 14-day HU sµg increases number of circulating blood neutrophils and elevates NLR. Blood from HU and NL (14-day) Wt mice.

Error bars denote standard error of mean.Prolonged Hindlimb Unloading (30-day) sµg Results in Elevated Blood Neutrophil Persistence and NLR, While This Effect is Mitigated in mCAT Mice Elevated neutrophil numbers and persistence in blood circulation result in tissue damage and impaired immune responses (66). HU also induces redox imbalance (8). Therefore, we compared the effects of prolonged HU (30-day) in Wt mice with transgenic mice expressing human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT) (54). Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that converts reactive hydrogen peroxide into non-reactive water and oxygen, a cellular antioxidant mechanism that restores redox balance. Comparable to 14-day HU, 30-day HU in Wt mice resulted in elevated neutrophils, no significant difference in lymphocytes, and an elevated NLR, while these results were mitigated in mCAT/HU mice ( Figures 5A–C and Figure S3 ). Oxidative stress and inflammatory gene expression in Wt and mCAT mice were assessed by qPCR. Compared to Wt/NL controls, Mpo (p = 0.0240*) was increased in Wt/HU ( Figure 5D ), while a non-significant elevation in NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox-2, p = 0.6411) and Il-1β (p = 0.1349) were also observed ( Figures 5E, F ). On the other hand, mCAT/HU mice partially mitigated some of these effects ( Figures 5D–F ). Collectively, prolonged HU (30-days) induced persistent NLR, oxidative stress and marginal inflammation, while catalase overexpression mitigated some of these outcomes. Figure 5. Open in a new tab 30-day HU sµg results in elevated blood neutrophil persistence and NLR with this effect mitigated in mCAT mice. Blood from HU (30-day) Wt and mCAT mice. % neutrophils (Ly6ghigh CD11b+/CD45+ events) (A), lymphocytes (CD11b-/CD45+) (B), and NLR (C) from NL and HU mice (n = 5–8). qPCR relative fold change (RFC) of Mpo (D), Nox-2 (E), and Il-1β (F) in blood collected from Wt and mCAT, NL and HU mice (30-day, n = 3–8). A two-way ANOVA and a non-parametric, Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was performed between groups, a * indicates p < 0.05. Error bars denote standard error of mean.Collectively, our findings demonstrated that, through potentially different mechanisms, both spaceflight and multiple sµg models elevated NLR, ROS, and MPO inflammation, while antioxidants mitigated some of these outcomes. Therefore, elevated NLR may be a suitable prognostic biomarker to monitor astronaut immune status and inflammation during long-duration missions.Discussion Spaceflight causes immune dysfunction that can lead to health risks for astronauts. Health risks that arise from immune dysfunction are complex and include an inability to defend against pathogens, altered tolerance to self-antigens resulting in potential autoimmunity development, chronic inflammation, and immune senescence. Therefore, mitigation during spaceflight will likely require selective targeting of specific immune cell types and/or developmental stages. Elevated NLR may be a prospective biomarker candidate to identify immune deviations that can cause disease. Currently, elevated NLR is used as a clinical biomarker to detect sub-clinical inflammation in humans and predicts poor prognosis in cancer (18). In this study, a spike in GLR in humans and NLR in rodents was observed at landing and elevated GLR and NLR were observed during spaceflight ( Figure 1 ). In humans, GLR was elevated at 180-days in-flight, suggesting prolonged exposure to spaceflight caused leukocyte differential changes. This change in immune differentials may be in response to elevated inflammation experienced in-flight (4, 6, 12), since elevated, chronic inflammation is often coupled with immune dysfunction and disease development (13, 19, 20, 67–70). Therefore, monitoring distinct biomarkers, such as elevated NLR, can determine when countermeasures can intervene to avert immune dysfunction, promote immune recovery, and prevent disease development. Elevated numbers of granulocytes and neutrophils were observed in vitro following 20 h of HARV-RWV modeled microgravity in human peripheral blood ( Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). However, since mature neutrophils are terminally differentiated in blood circulation, i.e., banded or segmented neutrophils, we estimate that this increased percentage is due to increased scatter properties indicative of cellular activation. Indeed, elevated cell surface expression of CD66b and CD11b per granulocyte, which are activation markers for neutrophils (58, 59), were increased in sµg ( Figure 3 and Figure S1 ). Further studies revealed elevated ROS and MPO expression ( Figure 3 ), confirming HARV-RWV sµg resulted in granulocytes, and in particular, neutrophil activation. Physiological effects of elevated active granulocytes or neutrophils in circulation intensifies sterile inflammation (70–72), promotes edema, and non-specific tissue damage (73), and can threaten astronaut health if not adequately controlled. Interestingly, MPO gene expression ( Figure 5D ) was elevated in HU, suggesting immature neutrophil entry into blood circulation, compared to neutrophil activation observed in vitro in the HARV-RWV. MPO gene synthesis only occurs in bone marrow early in neutrophil development, i.e. immature neutrophils (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes). MPO gene expression ends once neutrophils differentiate into metamyelocytes (74) and synthesized MPO protein is packaged into granules released during neutrophil activation (75). Typically, immature neutrophils are not released into blood circulation unless the body is in a diseased or inflammatory state (74, 75). However, since MPO gene expression was elevated in HU mice blood, this suggests the potential for myelocyte/immature neutrophil infiltration and may also serve as a biomarker for elevated inflammation during spaceflight. To our knowledge no measurements have been recorded for elevated immature neutrophils in blood circulation in-flight; however, elevated neutrophils were identified in blood from 9 of 16 astronauts at landing (6, 76, 77). As compared to the rodent spaceflight results (in-flight day 14), elevated neutrophils were also observed at days 14 and 30 of HU in mice ( Figures 4C and 5A ), suggesting the physical effects of fluid-shifting experienced during spaceflight and HU may stimulate the release of neutrophils into circulation; however this requires further investigation. Indeed, elevated MPO during sµg may contribute to immune dysfunction. MPO catalyzes hydrogen peroxide into reactive intermediates that can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA (67). Excess MPO impairs phagocytic function (67–69) and triggers neutrophil degranulation, causing inflammatory tissue damage (78) in cardiovascular disease (62, 67, 79). Pathologically this is relevant during spaceflight, as cardiovascular disease is a prominent risk factor associated with returned astronauts (80). Furthermore, elevated NLR is currently used as a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk on Earth (81), thereby highlighting the clinical relevance of monitoring NLR during spaceflight. Neutrophil oxidative burst responses and elevated ROS can induce cellular death (82), including lymphocyte apoptosis (83), and suppression of T lymphocyte function (84). HARV-RWV sµg induced ROS in granulocytes, indicating HARV-RWV sµg activated granulocytes and triggered the oxidative burst response. Thus HARV-RWV sµg can serve as a valuable model to study ROS-induced inflammation (72, 85). Indeed, redox imbalance occurs in humans and cell cultures exposed to spaceflight (4–6) and in vitro ground-based sµg models (8, 9, 86). The cause of elevated ROS in sµg may be due to: (1) cell death factors or other unknown stimulators of the oxidative burst response, (2) a mechanosensitive stress receptor in phagocytes that triggers redox imbalance (87), and/or (3) a combination of these effects. In our study, HARV-RWV sµg induced active Caspase 3/7 expression in lymphocyte populations ( Figure 2D ), indicating lymphocyte apoptosis and shifting of immune differentials to favor higher NLR and GLR. Further analyses of our in vivo HU studies revealed no difference in lymphocyte percent or absolute count populations ( Figures 4 and 5 , and Figures S2 and 3 ) compared to HARV-RWV sµg studies, suggesting elevated lymphocyte recovery or unknown ROS-quenching mechanisms that limit lymphocyte apoptosis, both of which require further studies. Therefore, the two sµg models, HARV-RWV and HU, displayed different mechanisms towards generating an elevated NLR. The HARV-RWV microgravity model appears to display robust lymphocyte turnover, i.e. elevated lymphocyte apoptosis, and most likely immune function that may differ from astronauts in-flight. However, this does not rule out that lymphocyte apoptosis does not occur in vivo HU, as turnover of lymphocytes to replace loss most likely occurs, albeit apoptosis may occur at a slower rate than in vitro HARV-RWV. Furthermore, ROS concentration within each sµg model may be drastically different. For example, ROS levels in HARV-RWV may be much higher in the absence of in vivo ROS quenchers compared to 14- or 30-day HU, which would affect the rate of lymphocyte apoptosis (88, 89). Indeed, concentration and exposure time of ROS determines cellular responses. Homeostatic levels of ROS can promote cell survival, while elevated ROS (oxidative stress) can induce cellular death (82). In line with this, the timeline of measurements of lymphocyte counts (20 h HARV-RWV versus 14- and 30-days HU) differ between the two models; therefore direct comparisons cannot be assumed. Finally, the HARV-RWV model cultured human blood samples, which have different leukocyte percentages compared to mice leukocytes in the HU model; therefore the kinetics of apoptosis across the two microgravity models would also be affected. Crucian et al. showed there is an elevation of granulocytes in blood circulation, while no differences are observed in lymphocyte absolute counts, suggesting lymphocytes may not undergo apoptosis in spaceflight; rather there may be release of more granulocytes into blood circulation (29). Controversially however, multiple reports have indicated lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cell lines undergo apoptosis during spaceflight/microgravity conditions (36–42), albeit measurements were either reported post-landing or from ex vivo cell cultures in flight. In fact, the role of apoptosis in lymphocyte depression (ROALD) experiment that was part of the BIO-4 mission and comprised of ESA, Energia, and NASA agencies, was performed with the goal to understand how microgravity affects lymphocyte apoptosis. The results showed after 48 h on-board the ISS ex vivo cultures of lymphocytes displayed increased DNA fragmentation, PARP protein expression, and elevated p53 expression, compared to ground controls (36). Due to this, we believe the in vivo HU microgravity model, although having its own limitations, may be a better representative ground-based model for spaceflight. Nonetheless, additional studies are required to better understand the degree of lymphocyte turnover during in vivo HU that is comparable to spaceflight. Monocytes were significantly reduced following HARV-RWV ( Figure 2B ); however no differences were observed in HU mice ( Figures S2D, E ), further indicating the variability between the two simulated microgravity models. Yet, inconsistency with these cell types in terms of population differentials have also been noted across spaceflight literature (77, 90, 91), which may be a factor of sampling timepoints. However, consensus suggests phagocytic function of monocytes following spaceflight is impaired (92, 93). Phagocytic impairment of monocytes can directly affect clearance of neutrophils from circulation, inflammation resolution (94), and can impact NLR. Therefore, further research into the function and distribution of monocytes following simulated microgravity are currently underway. Transgenic mice expressing the human antioxidant gene catalase reversed HU-induced elevation of NLR and dampened inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 5 ), suggesting redox imbalance caused leukocyte differential changes. In line with this, mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein with antioxidant activity, display elevated ROS expression and activated neutrophils (95). In our study, HARV-RWV sµg of human leukocytes induced neutrophil activation that was reversed in the presence of the antioxidant NAC ( Figure 3D ), further suggesting antioxidants can suppress inflammation. Indeed, in vivo NAC treatment successfully ameliorated acetic acid-induced colitis by reversing pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and MPO in rats (96). Collectively, these results indicate antioxidants as viable countermeasures to regulate spaceflight-induced inflammation and immune dysfunction. Clinically, elevated NLR (>3.53) (27) is a prognostic indicator for cancer development, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and infectious conditions (18, 21–23, 25), but no NLR standard has been established for astronaut immunity. Our results revealed elevated GLR in astronauts at landing (GLR = 3.6, Figure 1B ), compared to clinically relevant GLR (>2.24) (97), may result in biological significance for astronaut health. Although restoration to normal GLR occurred at landing on Earth, landing on the lunar surface and/or Mars, where gravity is less than Earth’s, may pose a significant risk to astronaut immune recovery. Therefore, monitoring and developing countermeasures to mitigate elevated NLR, GLR, and inflammatory neutrophil phenotypes for future long-duration and long-distance space travel are essential for mission success. In summary, we identified increased GLR and NLR in both human and rodent spaceflight samples and ground simulations of microgravity. Our results in vitro indicated that leukocytes shift in favor of elevated activated inflammatory neutrophils, which may amplify disease development in vivo. Further, antioxidants may be useful countermeasures to ameliorate these outcomes in sµg, as NAC treatment inhibited activated inflammatory human neutrophils in HARV-RWV and catalase partially mitigated elevated NLR in HU mice. Based on these findings, we suggest monitoring both in-flight and landing NLR to assess astronaut immune status. We further advocate the investigation of antioxidants as future countermeasures to mitigate immune deviations, including elevated NLR and inflammation, to safeguard astronaut health on future missions.Data Availability Statement The data analyzed in this study are subject to the following licenses/restrictions: NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) is an active repository for astronaut health datasets.

    "abstract": "Summary Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts with little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives. Subject Areas: Immunology, Space Sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction Recent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inflammation, elevated granulocytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015; Douda et al., 2015; Leliefeld et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less is known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration. Solar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation are charged particle ionizing types of radiation that will impact humans and spacecraft during lunar and deep spaceflight missions (Sridharan et al., 2020). High doses of these types of charged ionizing radiation types do not typically pose a threat to Earth, as we are shielded by the Earth's magnetosphere (Simonsen et al., 2020); however, astronauts on future missions to the lunar surface and Mars will have limited shielding from these damaging irradiation. Although doses experienced in deep space do not parallel those of LEO manned missions, health risks associated with LEO doses are still considerable. For instance, current missions in LEO, such as on the ISS, experience a low total absorbed dose of irradiation, estimated to be exposed to approximately 0.10–0.52 mGy/day, depending on the mission, as quantified by NASA GeneLab's environmental data for spaceflight experiments (Miller, 2020). SPE irradiation originates from protons being emitted during solar flares and coronal mass ejections (Narici et al., 2018; Sanzari et al., 2015), and although the majority of the ions are protons at different energies during these events, it can also include other ions such as helium and high- (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions (Hu, 2017). Limited number of human reports following SPE irradiation exposure are associated with astronauts on LEO spacewalks and lunar missions from the Apollo era (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013). The physiological effects of SPE irradiation exposure include fatigue, acute radiation sickness, long-term skin damage, elevated cytokine storms, and decreased blood and hemopoietic cell numbers (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013). GCR irradiation is emitted from the sun, stars, and energetic objects such as supernova (Nelson, 2016) and consists of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and high-energy high-charge (HZE) ions with intrinsic masses (for example, iron, silicon, oxygen, and carbon) (Nelson, 2016). As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence of SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day (Miller, 2020), astronauts in LEO could therefore be exposed up to a roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an extremely high dose of protons (Hu, 2017) possibly up to 1 Gy or more (Wu et al., 2009), which would pose significant health risks. NASA estimates that the amount of GCR irradiation exposure during deep space missions may be 0.3–0.6 mGy/day or more over a 3-year-long mission to Mars (0.245–0.360 Gy) (Nelson, 2016). Linear energy transfer (LET) is defined as the amount of energy that is deposited or transferred in a material from an ion (Chancellor et al., 2018). High-LET irradiation can cause more damaging ionizing tracks and pose a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) risk compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). However, this does not rule out the composite effects of low-LET continuous dose/dose rate involved during spaceflight (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2014), the effects of low LET inhibition of angiogenesis (Grabham et al., 2013), or the range of cellular damage by low-LET particles (Nelson, 2016). RBE is the relative amount of biological damage a dose of irradiation will have on tissue (Chancellor et al., 2018). Thus, identifying the immune responses following distinct ionizing irradiation types, along with described dosing schemes, RBEs, and protracted exposures, are essential for future exploration missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Due to limitations of performing deep space missions, there have been multiple ground-based research studies examining the effects of ionizing irradiation on immunity. For instance, large disparities in immune population subtypes, in particular lymphocytes (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2017; Gridley and Pecaut, 2011; Gridley et al., 2002; Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013) and induction of inflammation (Baselet et al., 2019; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016), have been reported. However, more information is required on the deep space-relevant spectra of irradiation effects on immunity. With recent advancements in simulated GCR and SPE dosing schemes at NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) within Brookhaven National Laboratory, the biological effects of realistic deep space exposures can now be successfully measured in ground-based studies (Simonsen et al., 2020). Therefore, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HU) in mice. We hypothesized that unique immune signatures and microRNA (miRNA) profiles would be produced by distinct experimental conditions of simulated GCR, SPE, and gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU. Although this study focuses on immune dysregulation during deep spaceflight, the knowledge gained from these studies can be applied to related issues on Earth such as, cancer radiotherapy, muscle degeneration, and immune-related diseases.",

    "results": "Results Simulated Deep Space Exposures Selectively Caused Reduced Immune Organ Weight and Total Leukocyte Populations Mice were exposed to acute, 0.5-Gy simplified GCR simulation (GCR sim), 1-Gy SPE simulation (SPE sim), or 5Gy gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (14-days total) and were weighed on days −3, 0, 7, and 14 (Figure 1A). Gamma irradiation was included to calculate the RBE of GCR sim and SPE sim. As charged particles generally have a higher RBE than photons (gamma irradiation) we used an elevated dose of 5 Gy. The results revealed significant difference in body weight across GCR and SPE irradiation combined with HU groups at 24 h post-irradiation exposures (i.e., day 14) (Figure 1B). Euthanasia was performed on day 14, and select immune organs were collected and weighed to determine if spaceflight exposures caused weight differences. Interestingly, all irradiation groups with HU had a significant decrease in spleen weight, compared to NL-Sham controls with intergroup comparisons between GCR and gamma (Figure 1C). For the thymus, SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups were significantly reduced in weight, along with both NL- and HU-gamma cohorts, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 1D). To address whether there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs) circulating within blood, which may result in weight disparities in the immune organs, common leukocyte antigen (CD45), which labels all leukocytes, was analyzed by flow cytometry within the total doublet discriminated (DD) events (Figures 1E–1G). The results showed reduced CD45+ circulating leukocyte populations within DD events following all exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 1F and 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that 24 h following combined exposures, there are immune system decrements, in both primary (thymus; SPE irradiation) and secondary (spleen; GCR and gamma irradiation) immune organs, which may be associated with reduced circulating leukocytes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Immune Organs and Total Leukocyte Populations Display Disparities following Simulated Deep Space Exposures (A) Experimental plan timeline: 15-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were cage acclimated for 3 days (day −3) before experimental initiation (0). Mice were either normally loaded (NL, shaded) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, not shaded) for 14 days. On day 13 mice were whole body irradiated with Sham (0 Gy, green), galactic cosmic rays (GCR, 0.5 Gy, blue), solar particle events (SPE, 1 Gy, red), or gamma (5 Gy, yellow) irradiation types (formulas described in Methods). 24 h post-irradiation (day 14), mice were euthanized and blood and tissues were collected. Body weights were measured on days −3, 0, 7, and 14. Tissue weights were measured on collection day 14. (B–G) (B) Body weights were measured on days −3, 0, 7, and 14. Immune organ weights of the spleen (C) and the thymus (D) were performed on collection day 14 and normalized to total body weight (g/g). Flow cytometric gating scheme to collect singlets, remove doublets, (“DD” denotes doublet discrimination), and identify CD45+ events (E). Percent (%) (F) and absolute counts (G) of total leukocyte populations (CD45+/all doublet discriminated events, DD) displayed for each exposure group. A Grubbs test was performed on all datasets followed by testing for normal distribution via a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, a one-way ANOVA Dunnett test was performed to compare NL and HU controls to all groups and a parametric unpaired t test with Welsh's correction was performed to compare between similar irradiation groups. If normality was not passed, both a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's posthoc analysis to compare NL and HU controls with all groups and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test comparing between similar irradiation groups were performed. Data in (B) represent a scatterplot. (C and D) Data represent a box-and-whiskers plot with minimum and maximum data points. (F and G) Bar graphs data represent means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 8–10 per group). “∗” denotes significant difference between NL-Sham and associated groups, “#” denotes significant difference between HU-Sham and associated groups, and intergroup “brackets with a &” denotes significant difference between each group. Filled circles, boxes, and bars denote normal loaded (NL), and non-filled circles, boxes, and bars denote hindlimb unloaded (HU). Innate Immune Profiles Revealed Distinct Populations following Simulated Deep Space Exposures Subgroups of leukocytes were analyzed to determine the profile of innate immune cells following 24 h of acute, simulated GCR, SPE, or gamma irradiation exposures, singly or in combination with HU (14 days). Gating schemes within CD45+ events displayed neutrophils (Ly6ghighCD11b+), eosinophils (Ly6glowCD11b+), monocytes (Ly6g−CD11b+), B cells (CD20+NK1.1-/CD45+) (Figures 2A, 3A, and S1A–S1C), and NK/NKT cells (CD20−NK1.1+/CD45+) (Figures 3A, 3C and S1D). The results revealed elevated neutrophil populations in HU-Sham, - SPE, and gamma irradiation in combination with HU groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 2C). No significant differences were seen between monocytes (Figure 2B) or neutrophils (Figure 2C) with GCR or SPE irradiation alone compared with NL-Sham controls. There were no differences noted across all innate immune groups following GCR irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C). Interestingly, a significant elevation in eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT (Figure 3C) cells was observed in single SPE and gamma irradiation, that was suppressed in combination with HU, which indicates SPE and gamma irradiation selectively targets these cell types compared to NL-Sham controls. Moreover, these results also indicate suppressed inflammation in response to combination SPE and gamma irradiation with HU. Interestingly, gamma irradiation alone induced all innate immune profiles, compared with NL-Sham controls, which was reduced in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C), indicating suppressed inflammation in gamma irradiation in combination with HU. Collectively, these trends suggest that higher doses of ionizing irradiation may be more toxic, causing heightened immunogenicity. Figure 2.

Adaptive Immune Profiles Revealed Select B, T Helper, and T Cytotoxic Lymphocytes Are Negatively Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures Lymphocytes are sensitive to ionizing irradiation exposures, whereby irradiation initiates DNA damage triggering apoptosis (Schaue and McBride, 2012). To assess the effects of deep space-relevant exposures on lymphocyte profiles we first assessed B cell populations. The gating scheme for B cells is displayed in Figure 3A. Although no difference was revealed for GCR irradiation alone, compared with NL-Sham controls, all other irradiation groups, singly or in combination with HU resulted in significant reduction of B cells, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and S1E). These results suggest possible impairments in antibody-producing, plasma cell differentiation. To confirm impaired B cell differentiation median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface CD20 was assessed, as CD20 expression levels are reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). There was no reduction in B cell surface expression of CD20 (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation processes are impaired with GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with HU, compared with NL-Sham controls. T cell lineages were also characterized by flow cytometry in blood following space-relevant conditions, including T helper (Th, CD8−CD4+/CD3+) and T cytotoxic (Tc, CD8+CD4-/CD3+) lymphocytes (Figure 4A). The results revealed GCR irradiation singly and in combination with HU significantly reduced circulating Th and Tc lymphocytes, compared to NL-Sham controls, whereas no significant effects in T cell populations were observed with gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E). In addition, SPE irradiation exposures (single and combination groups) also reduced Tc lymphocyte numbers (Figures 3C and 3E). Collectively, these results indicate impairment in B cell and effector/central memory T cell adaptive immune responses following deep space-relevant exposures, which can pose a major health risk limitation on future human exploration missions.

Lymphocyte Surface Expression of IL-7R Is Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures, with Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) To assess the mechanisms involved in reduced T cell percentage, we characterized the cell surface expression of IL-7R on circulating lymphocytes (Figures 5A and 5B). IL-7R expression varies throughout T cell development, whereby it is expressed on single-positive naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Furthermore, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012). The results revealed cell surface IL-7R median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was elevated in HU-Sham, compared to NL-Sham controls, which suggests enhanced inflammation following HU for 14 days (Figure 5C). GCR and SPE irradiation, singly and in combination with HU, resulted in no significant differences in IL-7R expression, compared to NL-Sham alone, other than GCR irradiation with HU, suggesting GCR irradiation in combination with HU may have induced T cell activation (Figure 5C). Percentage (%) lymphocytes (SSC-A versus CD45+, plot example in Figure 1G) further supports the damaging effects of GCR and SPE irradiation on these population types (Figure 5D). Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical biomarker for Paul et al., 2020 inflammation (Isaac et al., 2016), was elevated in HU-Sham controls, and in all irradiation-only groups, compared to NL-Sham controls, with partial reduction in combination with HU (Figure 5E). Collectively, these results suggest select T cell activation and inflammation following deep space simulation. Figure 5.

Simulated Deep Space Exposures Induced Unique Cytokine Profiles Select cytokine biomarkers consisting of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers were assessed in whole blood by qPCR. The cytokine panel included Ifn-γ, Il-4, Il-1β, Tnf-ɑ, iNOS, Il-6, and Il-10, and showed that unique cytokine profiles are induced in each exposure group (Figure 6A). Il-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine and marker of the inflammasome complex (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016), displayed elevated expression following SPE irradiation in the single exposure group, compared to NL-sham controls (Figure 6B). GCR irradiation displayed significant suppression of Il-1β in combination with HU, compared to GCR irradiation alone (Figure 6B). These results suggest combined simulated deep space exposures may have suppressed inflammation. Il-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine well known for its involvement in the acute phase response (Tanaka et al., 2014), was induced in HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 6C), suggesting exposure to simulated microgravity may induce inflammation. Interestingly, GCR irradiation in combination with HU resulted in Il-6 suppression (Figure 6C), supporting suppression of inflammation in combined deep space conditions of GCR irradiation and HU. Ifn-ɣ, is a cytokine produced by Tc cells, Th1 cells, NK/NKT cells, and innate lymphoid cells-1 subtype-1 (ILC1) (Colonna, 2018). It has been associated with NK cell activity (Lusty et al., 2017) and improved macrophage antigen presentation (Kak et al., 2018). We found in comparison to NL-sham controls, Ifn-γ was significantly upregulated in both GCR irradiation exposure groups, singly or combined with HU (Figure 6D). Furthermore, gamma irradiation resulted in increased expression of Ifn-γ in combination with HU, compared with gamma irradiation alone (Figure 6D). IL-4 is typically produced by Th2 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and its primary role promotes cellular survival (Keegan and Zamorano, 1998). We found significant fold elevation of Il-4 in all irradiation groups in combination with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6E), suggesting this cytokine may be critically involved in promoting cell survival in the remaining pool of cells following space-relevant exposures. Collectively, these results suggest unique cytokine signatures are produced following different simulated deep space exposures. Figure 6.

Statistical tests and labels are the same as Figure 1. miRNA Profiling Revealed A Relationship to Immune Dysfunction in Simulated Deep Space Exposures miRNAs are non-coding RNA interference molecules involved in silencing post-transcriptional gene expression (O'Brien et al., 2018). Due to their important role in gene expression regulation (O'Brien et al., 2018), contribution to immunity (Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009), and importance for therapeutic purposes (van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014), we sought to assess the circulating miRNA profile expressed in the plasma following simulated deep space exposures. We focused on miRNAs in plasma, as we have demonstrated that the immune system dysregulation is systemic and circulating (Beheshti et al., 2017, 2018, 2019; Mehta and Baltimore, 2016; Montagner et al., 2013; Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019). To determine the overall impact that miRNAs have on the immune system, we first predicted gene ontology (GO) terms with an false discovery rate < 0.05 from processed miRNA-sequenced plasma data for all conditions and filtered for specific immune GO terms (Figure 7). The GO immune terms were categorized by utilizing the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for specific GO immune terms (Smith and Eppig, 2009). An Upset plot (Figure S2) shows general up and down immune pathways in each listed condition and the overlapping pathways between conditions. Overall, majority of the immune pathways are downregulated. Pathways related to humoral immune responses were the exception and predicted to be upregulated due to miRNAs, as miRNAs in general can elevate humoral immunity (Danger et al., 2014; O'Connell et al., 2010). A more detailed analysis of the specific GO immune terms (Figure 7A) revealed specific pathways clustering together following specific irradiation exposures. We confirmed this pattern of immune dysregulation in deep space exposure groups in Hallmark pathways/gene sets (Liberzon et al., 2015) regulated by miRNAs, which showed distinct patterns within each group (Figure 7B). Collectively, these results confirmed that distinct immunogenic impairment following simulated deep space exposures may be regulated by circulating factors, specifically miRNAs. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Gene Ontology (GO) Analyses of miRNA Terms Display Select Exposures Caused Differential Immunogenic Responses GO terms with a false discovery rate <0.05 cutoff were considered significant. Specific immune-related GO terms were mapped to the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and were plotted with R packages.

Elevated Inflammation in Astronauts on ISS Missions in LEO Characterization of biomarkers of inflammation during spaceflight is critical for understanding human adaptation to spaceflight. Although ionizing irradiation exposures in LEO are not at the same as doses experienced in deep space, health risks associated with these doses are still considerable, and career limiting. To characterize inflammation experienced on orbit, we re-purposed retrospective data from ISS crewmembers participating in three experiments: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015). Pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-1α and pleiotropic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were analyzed. The results showed that IGF-1 was induced at in-flight day 15 and remained persistent through flight and during post-flight return (Figure 8 and Table S1). Cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α were also inconsistently elevated during flight, compared with preflight, whereas both returned to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth, suggesting ground readaptation (Figure 8). In addition, IL-1RA was also elevated in-flight, and returned to pre-flight baseline controls (L-45, Figure 8), indicating homeostatic inhibition of IL-1α and/or IL-1β may also be regulated in-flight. As both pro-inflammatory IL-1α and IL-1β levels are elevated in-flight, along with their inhibitor IL-1RA, it indicates that other factors involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression supersede IL-1RA inhibition. These studies, and others (Buchheim et al., 2019; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019), indicate that inflammation is induced in LEO, although mechanisms are also in place to maintain homeostasis, which may also apply during missions beyond LEO. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Elevated Markers of Inflammation in Astronauts on 4- to 6-Month ISS Missions Blood samples were collected at launch minus (L-) 45 days, on Flight Day (FD)15, FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180; post-flight samples were collected in the first 24 h after landing and again 30 days later . Inflammatory markers were analyzed in plasma for IGF-1, IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-1RA. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared with preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for. Data represent means ± SEM (∗∗∗p < 0.001, n = 59 crewmembers; 47 males, 12 females). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015).Herein, the results revealed that at 14 days post-HU and 1 day post-acute irradiation exposure, total body and immune organ (spleen and thymus) weights were reduced, which was accompanied by reduced total leukocytes in combination exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls. Most strikingly, reduced frequency of T effector lymphocytes (i.e., T helper, Th and T cytotoxic, Tc cells) and B lymphocytes in the presence of combined conditions, compared to NL-Sham controls, were noted indicating the potential for impaired adaptive immunity. Furthermore, differential cytokine profiles were also characterized, which displayed the potential for Th2 lineages to develop, while Gene Ontology (GO) and Hallmark terms determined by circulating miRNAs displayed similar immune deviations in mice. Similarly, astronaut data revealed inflammation occurs in LEO missions, analogous to our ground-based results in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that differential immune profiles are probable throughout the course of long-duration, exploratory missions in deep space and describe circulating immune biomarkers (i.e., select cell types and miRNAs) as potential therapeutic targets to regulate immunity.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Utilizing the recently developed simplified version of the NASA consensus formula of five different ions to simulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity in mice. We also sought to describe the contributing role of circulating miRNAs on the immune profile, as miRNAs have been identified as regulators of immunity (Baker et al., 2019; Danger et al., 2014; Mehta and Baltimore, 2016; Montagner et al., 2013; O'Brien et al., 2018; O'Connell et al., 2010; Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009). Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic responses (Baselet et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016). Indeed, high-LET irradiation causes more damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). Yet, comprehensive immune studies on the effects of acute high- and low-LET irradiation are limited (Gridley and Pecaut, 2006). Therefore, characterizing immune profiles and circulating miRNAs following distinct ionizing irradiation types are essential for successful missions to the lunar surface and Mars. In our study, both GCR and SPE irradiation exposures in the presence or absence of HU in mice caused a significant reduction in total leukocytes (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1), in particular Th and Tc cells (Figures 4B–4E). Whole body weights were significantly reduced in GCR and SPE irradiation groups in combination with HU (Figure 1B) along with reduced spleen weights in GCR and gamma irradiation (Figure 1C), which may be due to reduced circulating leukocytes (Figures 1F and 1G and S1). Furthermore, reduced thymus weights in HU combination groups with SPE irradiation (Figure 1D) implies reduced clonal diversity of lymphocytes during deep space exposures, which can affect adaptive immune responses against future challenges. In line with this, miRNA immune GO terms revealed reduced spleen and thymus development following all irradiation groups, further supporting that deep space exposures can impair immune organ development (Figure 7A). Thus, two possible outcomes are postulated: (1) delayed lymphocyte proliferation or (2) elevated apoptosis of both dividing and non-dividing cells. In addition, B cell differentiation and humoral immunity were also affected in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and 3C) that may be partially dependent on cytokine signals (Figure 6) and Th cell populations (Figures 4B and 4D). Innate immune profiles were also differentially affected following distinct exposures, adding another layer of complexity to this model. Nonetheless, these results collectively indicate unique immunogenic profiles following different ionizing irradiation exposures, in the presence or absence of simulated microgravity that may be useful for future space bioscience studies to expand upon. Along with different HU cage conditions/designs, head-down tilt angles (degrees of cephalad fluid shifting) used to simulate microgravity may cause distinct immune results. For instance, Wei et al. reported reduced thymic and spleen weights are due to lymphocyte apoptosis induced through elevated stress responses and corticosterone production on day 10 of HU exposure (25°–30° head-tilt angle) (Wei et al., 2003). However, Ferreira et al. showed no difference in body or adrenal weights following 14 or 28 days (15° head-tilt angle) of HU (Ferreira et al., 2011). Furthermore, work by Tahimic et al. revealed spleen weights were reduced at 30 days (30° head-tilt angle) of HU, which may have partially depended on the number of circulating Th cell populations (Tahimic et al., 2019). In our study, reduced thymus, but not spleen, weights were noted in HU-Sham, compared with NL-Sham controls (30º head-tilt angle) (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between Tc or Th populations following 14 days of HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B–4E), but there were significant reductions in total leukocyte populations (Figures 1F and 1G) and B cells (Figure 3B). Therefore, reduced thymus weights in HU-Sham compared to NL-Sham controls may be due to overall reduced leukocyte populations. Inflammation following simulated microgravity has been recorded in multiple studies (Cavey et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010, 2014), with an associated mechanism of elevated neutrophil counts (Dumont et al., 2007, 2008; Frenette et al., 2002; Tahimic et al., 2019) leading to uncontrolled musculoskeletal damage (Dumont et al., 2008; Frenette et al., 2002). In our study, there were elevated neutrophils (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), and Il-6 (Figure 6C) after 14 days of HU, suggesting neutrophil persistence, as IL-6 protects neutrophils from apoptosis (Asensi et al., 2004). Certainly, inflammatory neutrophil persistence can be damaging if not adequately controlled (Mortaz et al., 2018). Therefore, these results indicate HU, dependent on cage conditions/designs, may promote inflammation. Innate immune populations were also evaluated. For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in significant elevation of eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure 3D) percentages, compared to NL-Sham controls. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications (Puukila et al., 2017), while elevated NK cells (Ong et al., 2017) and eosinophils (Séguéla et al., 2015) can contribute to these pathologies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a significant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 2B–2D and Figure 3D), suggesting distinct immune profiles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma irradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared with GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation damage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers were reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls, indicating the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). However, for the purpose of establishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between the biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high-ionization control. Interestingly, all four innate populations studied are inflammation-producing cells upon activation and were suppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited inflammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms of reduced eosinophil (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure 3D). As such, a reduced number of select innate immune cells 24 h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated microgravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune GO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR-mediated signaling in all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis (Koenderman, 2019) are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure 7A). Collectively, impairment in both leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefficient innate responses against challenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregulation and heightened infections (Cervantes and Hong, 2016; Crucian et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Nash, 2000), which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment. However, further studies with these distinct deep space-relevant exposures, circulating miRNAs, and cell types are required. Aside from elevated Ifn-γ in GCR irradiation exposure groups, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6D), GCR irradiation in combination with HU displayed reduced inflammation compared with GCR irradiation alone, as measured by the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Il-1β and Il-6. These results suggest simulated microgravity suppressed inflammation in combination with GCR irradiation (Figures 6B and 6C). Indeed, this may partially explain reduced B cell percentage in GCR irradiation with simulated microgravity (Figure 3B), as IL-6 is a plasma cell differentiator that enhances humoral immunity (Dienz et al., 2009). Furthermore, IL-6 differentiates naive T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which drives B cell maturation into plasma cells (Crotty, 2014). IL-1β has also recently been characterized to play an important role in Tfh effector cell development as well (Ritvo and Klatzmann, 2019). Therefore, reduced expression of both of these cytokines in combined GCR irradiation with HU may be indirectly linked to reduced B cell differentiation. In line with this, both GCR irradiation groups displayed a significant reduction in Th cells compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B and 4D). Although distinct effector T cell profiles, including Tfh, were not thoroughly characterized, Tfh effector cell lineage would have been included in these overall Th cell populations. Additionally, CD20 surface molecule expression on B cells is reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). However, we did not see any difference in cell surface expression of CD20 MFI (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells may be impaired in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared to NL-Sham controls. As B cell numbers are reduced (with no difference in CD20 surface expression) within GCR and SPE in combination with HU groups, there is a lower pool of antibody-production vehicles essential for effective humoral immunity. miRNA GO immune terms displayed reduced B cell differentiation and homeostasis in SPE irradiation and gamma irradiation, compared with HU-Sham controls, but was no different with GCR irradiation groups (Figure 7A), further suggesting distinct immune-related pathways are regulated following deep space simulations. Of interest, robust gene expression of Il-4 (Figure 6E), which is produced by Th2 and Tfh cells, directly promotes B cell maturation to plasma cells and ultimately the release of antibodies. Therefore, although initial B cell populations are reduced, functional output may be compensated for via robust expression of Il-4. LEO spaceflight missions have described minimal differences in B cell numbers and antibody production of IgG or IgM; however, IgA levels in flight were significantly upregulated compared with ground controls (Spielmann et al., 2019). This effect may be explained by the general effects of circulating miRNAs, as humoral immunity is predicted to be elevated by miRNAs (Danger et al., 2014; O'Connell et al., 2010). In our study, general upregulation of humoral responses are shown, yet multiple miRNA GO terms revealed that the humoral immune responses mediated by circulating Igs and B cells were suppressed with GCR combined with HU, compared to HU-Sham controls, further supporting humoral immunity may be dysregulated following deep space simulations (Figure 7A). Future studies addressing the level of Ig antibodies, B cell/plasma cell distribution, and circulating miRNAs involved during deep space missions would provide further insight into mechanisms involved in humoral immunity. A principal finding in our study was reduced expression of Th and Tc cells, compared to NL-Sham controls. As main components of the adaptive immune system, both Th and Tc cells provide the advantage of immunological memory and assist with humoral immunity, which are important to prevent recurrent infections and tumor development. This becomes particularly important during long-duration missions, where medial intervention is limited. Indeed, infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus reactivate during LEO spaceflight and are dependent on impaired cytotoxic T cells (Mehta et al., 2017; Nash, 2000). Furthermore, previous reports have indicated ionizing irradiation activates T cells (Schaue and McBride, 2012). However, the overall effect of ionizing irradiation on lymphocyte outcomes (i.e., activation or apoptosis) depends on multiple factors, most notably the dose and dose schedule (MacLennan and Kay, 1978; Schaue and McBride, 2012). For instance, preconditioning mice, i.e., irradiation for graft transplantation, relies on lethal bone marrow irradiation doses and fractionations to reduce lymphocyte counts (Bagley et al., 2002). In our study, GCR irradiation caused extensive reduction in both Th and Tc cells, compared with SPE or gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E), indicating GCR irradiation produced more damaging effects on these cell types. Inhomogeneous dose depth between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photon (gamma) tracks may be involved in this effect, as gamma irradiation exposure groups did not significantly affect Th or Tc numbers, compared with SPE and GCR irradiation groups. Thus, GCR and SPE irradiation may target deeper immune tissues, such as lymph nodes, where the majority of T naive and circulating T effector cells reside when not trafficking in the bloodstream (Hunter et al., 2016). The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes is dependent on the speed of DNA repair mechanisms relative to division, as non-proliferating cells are more radioresistant (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Radioresistance is observed in non-dividing cells as these cells are in G0 stage, during which DNA is compact and stable, protein-protected heterochromatin (Falk et al., 2008; Karagiannis et al., 2007). Proliferating lymphocytes, on the other hand, have exited the G0 stage and are in the DNA synthesis phase, which makes them more vulnerable to irradiation damage (Falk et al., 2008; Karagiannis et al., 2007). Cellular division requires correct, undamaged DNA to be copied to their progeny, and if repair mechanisms are not fast enough, elevated apoptosis results (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms for DNA repair are upregulated, indicating after exposure to deep space simulations, circulating miRNAs are involved in DNA repair machinery, whereby DNA damage has occurred (Figure 7B). Although we did not measure apoptosis directly, miRNA Hallmark terms also identified select apoptosis pathways were engaged during GCR irradiation exposures, compared to HU-Sham controls (Figure 7B), suggesting elevated DNA damage may be beyond repair, leading to apoptosis, following GCR irradiation conditions. We further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL-7R. As described above, IL-7R is expressed on naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Indeed, IL-7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls, suggesting T cell activation (Figure 5C). In line with this, Il7R knockout mice have significantly reduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocompromised (Peschon et al., 1994). This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations following simulated spaceflight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interestingly, miR-199a and miR-142–3p target Il7R (Luo and Fu, 2018), reducing its expression levels; however, in our report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012). For example, blocking IL-7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN-γ from memory cytotoxic T cells, limiting chronic inflammation (Belarif et al., 2018). In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduction of PI3K/AKT signaling and inflammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space exposures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure 7B). Alternatively, HU-Sham groups had elevated IL-7R MFI, which suggests elevated inflammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU-Sham controls displayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure 7B). Heightened ROS can cause inflammation both in spaceflight and on Earth (Crucian et al., 2018; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2017), which may be an associated mechanism involved during heightened inflammation in the HU-Sham groups. Therefore, IL-7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), Il-6 expression (Figure 6C), and ROS Hallmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure 7B) are all elevated in HU-Sham mice, further supporting inflammatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed inflammation via elevated IL-1β and IL-1α compared with pre-flight controls (Figure 8, Table S1). Importantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceflight, whereby the effects of ionizing irradiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure 8, Table S1), confirming inflammation is induced in LEO astronauts, similar to our ground HU model. Lymphopenia, or reduced T and B cell counts, poses a problem for adequate immunological protection against challenges (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Furthermore, lymphopenia recovery results in immune profiling changes that may be either detrimental or helpful to the host. In this report, compared to NL-Sham controls, robust induction of Il-4 following all ionizing irradiation groups combined with HU was noted. IL-4 is typically associated with Th2 effector cells, which are chiefly involved in allergic inflammation, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease (Nakayama et al., 2017). Interestingly, during spaceflight astronauts experience elevated allergic-like symptoms including rashes (Dunn et al., 2018) and hypersensitivity episodes (Voorhies et al., 2019). Therefore, Th2 immunity may be the principal immune response generated during deep space exposures; however, further evaluation of the type of Th cell subtypes produced in response to simulated deep space exposures are necessary. Deep spaceflight exposures present immunologically complicated outcomes. Synergistic inflammatory or immunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non-productive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell-to-cell transfer via exosomes) (Montagner et al., 2013; Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019) contribute to unique immune profiles, therefore miRNAs may be important for immune-targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving combined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would also be experienced during deep spaceflight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore, only a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal responses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct immune profiles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in combination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses in crew members may be required during long-duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Limitations of the Study In this study, we report the immune and miRNA differentials of mice following ground-based simulations of deep spaceflight, along with analyses of crew member inflammation in LEO. As this study utilized ground-based simulations in mice, deep spaceflight comparisons would be required to confirm similar profiles. Additionally, interpretation of whole-blood transcriptomics to specific cell types is limited in this study; however, these data provide insight into the overall cytokine profile induced by each condition that is independent of cell frequency. Furthermore, the contribution of miRNAs to the generated immune populations is described; however, an understanding into mechanism and/or functional outcomes would fully elucidate their role to overall immunity. In addition, the time point of collections was at an immediate response, yet the long-term response would also be of benefit, in particular, for long-duration missions. Finally, the comparisons between the immune differentials in mice and humans is a limitation; however, this study can give some insight into the significant immune population changes (i.e., T cytotoxic lymphocytes) that can be studied in humans during deep spaceflight mission in the near future.

Copyright notice ID: 7756144 PMID: 33376970 Summary Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts with little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives. Subject Areas: Immunology, Space SciencesGraphical Abstract Open in a new tabHighlights •Murine immune profiles from simulated deep spaceflight conditions were analyzed •Immune profiling revealed unique immune diversity with each experimental condition •Plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation •Astronaut data showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions Immunology; Space SciencesIntroduction Recent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inflammation, elevated granulocytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015; Douda et al., 2015; Leliefeld et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less is known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration. Solar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation are charged particle ionizing types of radiation that will impact humans and spacecraft during lunar and deep spaceflight missions (Sridharan et al., 2020). High doses of these types of charged ionizing radiation types do not typically pose a threat to Earth, as we are shielded by the Earth's magnetosphere (Simonsen et al., 2020); however, astronauts on future missions to the lunar surface and Mars will have limited shielding from these damaging irradiation. Although doses experienced in deep space do not parallel those of LEO manned missions, health risks associated with LEO doses are still considerable. For instance, current missions in LEO, such as on the ISS, experience a low total absorbed dose of irradiation, estimated to be exposed to approximately 0.10–0.52 mGy/day, depending on the mission, as quantified by NASA GeneLab's environmental data for spaceflight experiments (Miller, 2020). SPE irradiation originates from protons being emitted during solar flares and coronal mass ejections (Narici et al., 2018; Sanzari et al., 2015), and although the majority of the ions are protons at different energies during these events, it can also include other ions such as helium and high- (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions (Hu, 2017). Limited number of human reports following SPE irradiation exposure are associated with astronauts on LEO spacewalks and lunar missions from the Apollo era (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013). The physiological effects of SPE irradiation exposure include fatigue, acute radiation sickness, long-term skin damage, elevated cytokine storms, and decreased blood and hemopoietic cell numbers (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013). GCR irradiation is emitted from the sun, stars, and energetic objects such as supernova (Nelson, 2016) and consists of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and high-energy high-charge (HZE) ions with intrinsic masses (for example, iron, silicon, oxygen, and carbon) (Nelson, 2016). As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence of SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day (Miller, 2020), astronauts in LEO could therefore be exposed up to a roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an extremely high dose of protons (Hu, 2017) possibly up to 1 Gy or more (Wu et al., 2009), which would pose significant health risks. NASA estimates that the amount of GCR irradiation exposure during deep space missions may be 0.3–0.6 mGy/day or more over a 3-year-long mission to Mars (0.245–0.360 Gy) (Nelson, 2016). Linear energy transfer (LET) is defined as the amount of energy that is deposited or transferred in a material from an ion (Chancellor et al., 2018). High-LET irradiation can cause more damaging ionizing tracks and pose a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) risk compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). However, this does not rule out the composite effects of low-LET continuous dose/dose rate involved during spaceflight (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2014), the effects of low LET inhibition of angiogenesis (Grabham et al., 2013), or the range of cellular damage by low-LET particles (Nelson, 2016). RBE is the relative amount of biological damage a dose of irradiation will have on tissue (Chancellor et al., 2018). Thus, identifying the immune responses following distinct ionizing irradiation types, along with described dosing schemes, RBEs, and protracted exposures, are essential for future exploration missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Due to limitations of performing deep space missions, there have been multiple ground-based research studies examining the effects of ionizing irradiation on immunity. For instance, large disparities in immune population subtypes, in particular lymphocytes (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2017; Gridley and Pecaut, 2011; Gridley et al., 2002; Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013) and induction of inflammation (Baselet et al., 2019; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016), have been reported. However, more information is required on the deep space-relevant spectra of irradiation effects on immunity. With recent advancements in simulated GCR and SPE dosing schemes at NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) within Brookhaven National Laboratory, the biological effects of realistic deep space exposures can now be successfully measured in ground-based studies (Simonsen et al., 2020). Therefore, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HU) in mice. We hypothesized that unique immune signatures and microRNA (miRNA) profiles would be produced by distinct experimental conditions of simulated GCR, SPE, and gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU. Although this study focuses on immune dysregulation during deep spaceflight, the knowledge gained from these studies can be applied to related issues on Earth such as, cancer radiotherapy, muscle degeneration, and immune-related diseases.Results Simulated Deep Space Exposures Selectively Caused Reduced Immune Organ Weight and Total Leukocyte Populations Mice were exposed to acute, 0.5-Gy simplified GCR simulation (GCR sim), 1-Gy SPE simulation (SPE sim), or 5Gy gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (14-days total) and were weighed on days −3, 0, 7, and 14 (Figure 1A). Gamma irradiation was included to calculate the RBE of GCR sim and SPE sim. As charged particles generally have a higher RBE than photons (gamma irradiation) we used an elevated dose of 5 Gy. The results revealed significant difference in body weight across GCR and SPE irradiation combined with HU groups at 24 h post-irradiation exposures (i.e., day 14) (Figure 1B). Euthanasia was performed on day 14, and select immune organs were collected and weighed to determine if spaceflight exposures caused weight differences. Interestingly, all irradiation groups with HU had a significant decrease in spleen weight, compared to NL-Sham controls with intergroup comparisons between GCR and gamma (Figure 1C). For the thymus, SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups were significantly reduced in weight, along with both NL- and HU-gamma cohorts, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 1D). To address whether there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs) circulating within blood, which may result in weight disparities in the immune organs, common leukocyte antigen (CD45), which labels all leukocytes, was analyzed by flow cytometry within the total doublet discriminated (DD) events (Figures 1E–1G). The results showed reduced CD45+ circulating leukocyte populations within DD events following all exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 1F and 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that 24 h following combined exposures, there are immune system decrements, in both primary (thymus; SPE irradiation) and secondary (spleen; GCR and gamma irradiation) immune organs, which may be associated with reduced circulating leukocytes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Immune Organs and Total Leukocyte Populations Display Disparities following Simulated Deep Space Exposures (A) Experimental plan timeline: 15-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were cage acclimated for 3 days (day −3) before experimental initiation (0). Mice were either normally loaded (NL, shaded) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, not shaded) for 14 days. On day 13 mice were whole body irradiated with Sham (0 Gy, green), galactic cosmic rays (GCR, 0.5 Gy, blue), solar particle events (SPE, 1 Gy, red), or gamma (5 Gy, yellow) irradiation types (formulas described in Methods). 24 h post-irradiation (day 14), mice were euthanized and blood and tissues were collected. Body weights were measured on days −3, 0, 7, and 14. Tissue weights were measured on collection day 14. (B–G) (B) Body weights were measured on days −3, 0, 7, and 14. Immune organ weights of the spleen (C) and the thymus (D) were performed on collection day 14 and normalized to total body weight (g/g).

Percent (%) (F) and absolute counts (G) of total leukocyte populations (CD45+/all doublet discriminated events, DD) displayed for each exposure group. A Grubbs test was performed on all datasets followed by testing for normal distribution via a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, a one-way ANOVA Dunnett test was performed to compare NL and HU controls to all groups and a parametric unpaired t test with Welsh's correction was performed to compare between similar irradiation groups. If normality was not passed, both a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's posthoc analysis to compare NL and HU controls with all groups and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test comparing between similar irradiation groups were performed.

Gating schemes within CD45+ events displayed neutrophils (Ly6ghighCD11b+), eosinophils (Ly6glowCD11b+), monocytes (Ly6g−CD11b+), B cells (CD20+NK1.1-/CD45+) (Figures 2A, 3A, and S1A–S1C), and NK/NKT cells (CD20−NK1.1+/CD45+) (Figures 3A, 3C and S1D). The results revealed elevated neutrophil populations in HU-Sham, - SPE, and gamma irradiation in combination with HU groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 2C). No significant differences were seen between monocytes (Figure 2B) or neutrophils (Figure 2C) with GCR or SPE irradiation alone compared with NL-Sham controls. There were no differences noted across all innate immune groups following GCR irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C). Interestingly, a significant elevation in eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT (Figure 3C) cells was observed in single SPE and gamma irradiation, that was suppressed in combination with HU, which indicates SPE and gamma irradiation selectively targets these cell types compared to NL-Sham controls. Moreover, these results also indicate suppressed inflammation in response to combination SPE and gamma irradiation with HU. Interestingly, gamma irradiation alone induced all innate immune profiles, compared with NL-Sham controls, which was reduced in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C), indicating suppressed inflammation in gamma irradiation in combination with HU. Collectively, these trends suggest that higher doses of ionizing irradiation may be more toxic, causing heightened immunogenicity. Figure 2.

Statistical tests and labels are the same as Figure 1.Adaptive Immune Profiles Revealed Select B, T Helper, and T Cytotoxic Lymphocytes Are Negatively Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures Lymphocytes are sensitive to ionizing irradiation exposures, whereby irradiation initiates DNA damage triggering apoptosis (Schaue and McBride, 2012). To assess the effects of deep space-relevant exposures on lymphocyte profiles we first assessed B cell populations. The gating scheme for B cells is displayed in Figure 3A. Although no difference was revealed for GCR irradiation alone, compared with NL-Sham controls, all other irradiation groups, singly or in combination with HU resulted in significant reduction of B cells, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and S1E). These results suggest possible impairments in antibody-producing, plasma cell differentiation. To confirm impaired B cell differentiation median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface CD20 was assessed, as CD20 expression levels are reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). There was no reduction in B cell surface expression of CD20 (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation processes are impaired with GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with HU, compared with NL-Sham controls. T cell lineages were also characterized by flow cytometry in blood following space-relevant conditions, including T helper (Th, CD8−CD4+/CD3+) and T cytotoxic (Tc, CD8+CD4-/CD3+) lymphocytes (Figure 4A). The results revealed GCR irradiation singly and in combination with HU significantly reduced circulating Th and Tc lymphocytes, compared to NL-Sham controls, whereas no significant effects in T cell populations were observed with gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E). In addition, SPE irradiation exposures (single and combination groups) also reduced Tc lymphocyte numbers (Figures 3C and 3E). Collectively, these results indicate impairment in B cell and effector/central memory T cell adaptive immune responses following deep space-relevant exposures, which can pose a major health risk limitation on future human exploration missions.

Bar graph data represent means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 7–10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same as Figure 1.Lymphocyte Surface Expression of IL-7R Is Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures, with Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) To assess the mechanisms involved in reduced T cell percentage, we characterized the cell surface expression of IL-7R on circulating lymphocytes (Figures 5A and 5B). IL-7R expression varies throughout T cell development, whereby it is expressed on single-positive naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Furthermore, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012). The results revealed cell surface IL-7R median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was elevated in HU-Sham, compared to NL-Sham controls, which suggests enhanced inflammation following HU for 14 days (Figure 5C). GCR and SPE irradiation, singly and in combination with HU, resulted in no significant differences in IL-7R expression, compared to NL-Sham alone, other than GCR irradiation with HU, suggesting GCR irradiation in combination with HU may have induced T cell activation (Figure 5C). Percentage (%) lymphocytes (SSC-A versus CD45+, plot example in Figure 1G) further supports the damaging effects of GCR and SPE irradiation on these population types (Figure 5D). Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical biomarker for Paul et al., 2020 inflammation (Isaac et al., 2016), was elevated in HU-Sham controls, and in all irradiation-only groups, compared to NL-Sham controls, with partial reduction in combination with HU (Figure 5E). Collectively, these results suggest select T cell activation and inflammation following deep space simulation. Figure 5.

(C–E) Bar graph data represent means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 6–10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same as Figure 1.Simulated Deep Space Exposures Induced Unique Cytokine Profiles Select cytokine biomarkers consisting of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers were assessed in whole blood by qPCR. The cytokine panel included Ifn-γ, Il-4, Il-1β, Tnf-ɑ, iNOS, Il-6, and Il-10, and showed that unique cytokine profiles are induced in each exposure group (Figure 6A). Il-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine and marker of the inflammasome complex (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016), displayed elevated expression following SPE irradiation in the single exposure group, compared to NL-sham controls (Figure 6B). GCR irradiation displayed significant suppression of Il-1β in combination with HU, compared to GCR irradiation alone (Figure 6B). These results suggest combined simulated deep space exposures may have suppressed inflammation. Il-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine well known for its involvement in the acute phase response (Tanaka et al., 2014), was induced in HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 6C), suggesting exposure to simulated microgravity may induce inflammation. Interestingly, GCR irradiation in combination with HU resulted in Il-6 suppression (Figure 6C), supporting suppression of inflammation in combined deep space conditions of GCR irradiation and HU. Ifn-ɣ, is a cytokine produced by Tc cells, Th1 cells, NK/NKT cells, and innate lymphoid cells-1 subtype-1 (ILC1) (Colonna, 2018). It has been associated with NK cell activity (Lusty et al., 2017) and improved macrophage antigen presentation (Kak et al., 2018). We found in comparison to NL-sham controls, Ifn-γ was significantly upregulated in both GCR irradiation exposure groups, singly or combined with HU (Figure 6D). Furthermore, gamma irradiation resulted in increased expression of Ifn-γ in combination with HU, compared with gamma irradiation alone (Figure 6D). IL-4 is typically produced by Th2 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and its primary role promotes cellular survival (Keegan and Zamorano, 1998). We found significant fold elevation of Il-4 in all irradiation groups in combination with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6E), suggesting this cytokine may be critically involved in promoting cell survival in the remaining pool of cells following space-relevant exposures. Collectively, these results suggest unique cytokine signatures are produced following different simulated deep space exposures. Figure 6.

Statistical tests and labels are the same as Figure 1.miRNA Profiling Revealed A Relationship to Immune Dysfunction in Simulated Deep Space Exposures miRNAs are non-coding RNA interference molecules involved in silencing post-transcriptional gene expression (O'Brien et al., 2018). Due to their important role in gene expression regulation (O'Brien et al., 2018), contribution to immunity (Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009), and importance for therapeutic purposes (van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014), we sought to assess the circulating miRNA profile expressed in the plasma following simulated deep space exposures. We focused on miRNAs in plasma, as we have demonstrated that the immune system dysregulation is systemic and circulating (Beheshti et al., 2017, 2018, 2019; Mehta and Baltimore, 2016; Montagner et al., 2013; Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019). To determine the overall impact that miRNAs have on the immune system, we first predicted gene ontology (GO) terms with an false discovery rate < 0.05 from processed miRNA-sequenced plasma data for all conditions and filtered for specific immune GO terms (Figure 7). The GO immune terms were categorized by utilizing the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for specific GO immune terms (Smith and Eppig, 2009). An Upset plot (Figure S2) shows general up and down immune pathways in each listed condition and the overlapping pathways between conditions. Overall, majority of the immune pathways are downregulated. Pathways related to humoral immune responses were the exception and predicted to be upregulated due to miRNAs, as miRNAs in general can elevate humoral immunity (Danger et al., 2014; O'Connell et al., 2010). A more detailed analysis of the specific GO immune terms (Figure 7A) revealed specific pathways clustering together following specific irradiation exposures. We confirmed this pattern of immune dysregulation in deep space exposure groups in Hallmark pathways/gene sets (Liberzon et al., 2015) regulated by miRNAs, which showed distinct patterns within each group (Figure 7B). Collectively, these results confirmed that distinct immunogenic impairment following simulated deep space exposures may be regulated by circulating factors, specifically miRNAs. Figure 7.

Although ionizing irradiation exposures in LEO are not at the same as doses experienced in deep space, health risks associated with these doses are still considerable, and career limiting. To characterize inflammation experienced on orbit, we re-purposed retrospective data from ISS crewmembers participating in three experiments: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015). Pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-1α and pleiotropic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were analyzed. The results showed that IGF-1 was induced at in-flight day 15 and remained persistent through flight and during post-flight return (Figure 8 and Table S1). Cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α were also inconsistently elevated during flight, compared with preflight, whereas both returned to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth, suggesting ground readaptation (Figure 8). In addition, IL-1RA was also elevated in-flight, and returned to pre-flight baseline controls (L-45, Figure 8), indicating homeostatic inhibition of IL-1α and/or IL-1β may also be regulated in-flight. As both pro-inflammatory IL-1α and IL-1β levels are elevated in-flight, along with their inhibitor IL-1RA, it indicates that other factors involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression supersede IL-1RA inhibition. These studies, and others (Buchheim et al., 2019; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019), indicate that inflammation is induced in LEO, although mechanisms are also in place to maintain homeostasis, which may also apply during missions beyond LEO. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Elevated Markers of Inflammation in Astronauts on 4- to 6-Month ISS Missions Blood samples were collected at launch minus (L-) 45 days, on Flight Day (FD)15, FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180; post-flight samples were collected in the first 24 h after landing and again 30 days later . Inflammatory markers were analyzed in plasma for IGF-1, IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-1RA. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared with preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for. Data represent means ± SEM (∗∗∗p < 0.001, n = 59 crewmembers; 47 males, 12 females). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015).Herein, the results revealed that at 14 days post-HU and 1 day post-acute irradiation exposure, total body and immune organ (spleen and thymus) weights were reduced, which was accompanied by reduced total leukocytes in combination exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls. Most strikingly, reduced frequency of T effector lymphocytes (i.e., T helper, Th and T cytotoxic, Tc cells) and B lymphocytes in the presence of combined conditions, compared to NL-Sham controls, were noted indicating the potential for impaired adaptive immunity. Furthermore, differential cytokine profiles were also characterized, which displayed the potential for Th2 lineages to develop, while Gene Ontology (GO) and Hallmark terms determined by circulating miRNAs displayed similar immune deviations in mice. Similarly, astronaut data revealed inflammation occurs in LEO missions, analogous to our ground-based results in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that differential immune profiles are probable throughout the course of long-duration, exploratory missions in deep space and describe circulating immune biomarkers (i.e., select cell types and miRNAs) as potential therapeutic targets to regulate immunity.Discussion Utilizing the recently developed simplified version of the NASA consensus formula of five different ions to simulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity in mice. We also sought to describe the contributing role of circulating miRNAs on the immune profile, as miRNAs have been identified as regulators of immunity (Baker et al., 2019; Danger et al., 2014; Mehta and Baltimore, 2016; Montagner et al., 2013; O'Brien et al., 2018; O'Connell et al., 2010; Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009). Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic responses (Baselet et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016). Indeed, high-LET irradiation causes more damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). Yet, comprehensive immune studies on the effects of acute high- and low-LET irradiation are limited (Gridley and Pecaut, 2006). Therefore, characterizing immune profiles and circulating miRNAs following distinct ionizing irradiation types are essential for successful missions to the lunar surface and Mars. In our study, both GCR and SPE irradiation exposures in the presence or absence of HU in mice caused a significant reduction in total leukocytes (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1), in particular Th and Tc cells (Figures 4B–4E). Whole body weights were significantly reduced in GCR and SPE irradiation groups in combination with HU (Figure 1B) along with reduced spleen weights in GCR and gamma irradiation (Figure 1C), which may be due to reduced circulating leukocytes (Figures 1F and 1G and S1). Furthermore, reduced thymus weights in HU combination groups with SPE irradiation (Figure 1D) implies reduced clonal diversity of lymphocytes during deep space exposures, which can affect adaptive immune responses against future challenges. In line with this, miRNA immune GO terms revealed reduced spleen and thymus development following all irradiation groups, further supporting that deep space exposures can impair immune organ development (Figure 7A). Thus, two possible outcomes are postulated: (1) delayed lymphocyte proliferation or (2) elevated apoptosis of both dividing and non-dividing cells. In addition, B cell differentiation and humoral immunity were also affected in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and 3C) that may be partially dependent on cytokine signals (Figure 6) and Th cell populations (Figures 4B and 4D). Innate immune profiles were also differentially affected following distinct exposures, adding another layer of complexity to this model. Nonetheless, these results collectively indicate unique immunogenic profiles following different ionizing irradiation exposures, in the presence or absence of simulated microgravity that may be useful for future space bioscience studies to expand upon. Along with different HU cage conditions/designs, head-down tilt angles (degrees of cephalad fluid shifting) used to simulate microgravity may cause distinct immune results. For instance, Wei et al. reported reduced thymic and spleen weights are due to lymphocyte apoptosis induced through elevated stress responses and corticosterone production on day 10 of HU exposure (25°–30° head-tilt angle) (Wei et al., 2003). However, Ferreira et al. showed no difference in body or adrenal weights following 14 or 28 days (15° head-tilt angle) of HU (Ferreira et al., 2011). Furthermore, work by Tahimic et al. revealed spleen weights were reduced at 30 days (30° head-tilt angle) of HU, which may have partially depended on the number of circulating Th cell populations (Tahimic et al., 2019). In our study, reduced thymus, but not spleen, weights were noted in HU-Sham, compared with NL-Sham controls (30º head-tilt angle) (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between Tc or Th populations following 14 days of HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B–4E), but there were significant reductions in total leukocyte populations (Figures 1F and 1G) and B cells (Figure 3B). Therefore, reduced thymus weights in HU-Sham compared to NL-Sham controls may be due to overall reduced leukocyte populations. Inflammation following simulated microgravity has been recorded in multiple studies (Cavey et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010, 2014), with an associated mechanism of elevated neutrophil counts (Dumont et al., 2007, 2008; Frenette et al., 2002; Tahimic et al., 2019) leading to uncontrolled musculoskeletal damage (Dumont et al., 2008; Frenette et al., 2002). In our study, there were elevated neutrophils (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), and Il-6 (Figure 6C) after 14 days of HU, suggesting neutrophil persistence, as IL-6 protects neutrophils from apoptosis (Asensi et al., 2004). Certainly, inflammatory neutrophil persistence can be damaging if not adequately controlled (Mortaz et al., 2018). Therefore, these results indicate HU, dependent on cage conditions/designs, may promote inflammation. Innate immune populations were also evaluated. For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in significant elevation of eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure 3D) percentages, compared to NL-Sham controls. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications (Puukila et al., 2017), while elevated NK cells (Ong et al., 2017) and eosinophils (Séguéla et al., 2015) can contribute to these pathologies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a significant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 2B–2D and Figure 3D), suggesting distinct immune profiles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma irradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared with GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation damage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers were reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls, indicating the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). However, for the purpose of establishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between the biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high-ionization control. Interestingly, all four innate populations studied are inflammation-producing cells upon activation and were suppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited inflammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms of reduced eosinophil (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure 3D). As such, a reduced number of select innate immune cells 24 h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated microgravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune GO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR-mediated signaling in all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis (Koenderman, 2019) are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure 7A). Collectively, impairment in both leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefficient innate responses against challenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregulation and heightened infections (Cervantes and Hong, 2016; Crucian et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Nash, 2000), which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment. However, further studies with these distinct deep space-relevant exposures, circulating miRNAs, and cell types are required. Aside from elevated Ifn-γ in GCR irradiation exposure groups, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6D), GCR irradiation in combination with HU displayed reduced inflammation compared with GCR irradiation alone, as measured by the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Il-1β and Il-6. These results suggest simulated microgravity suppressed inflammation in combination with GCR irradiation (Figures 6B and 6C). Indeed, this may partially explain reduced B cell percentage in GCR irradiation with simulated microgravity (Figure 3B), as IL-6 is a plasma cell differentiator that enhances humoral immunity (Dienz et al., 2009). Furthermore, IL-6 differentiates naive T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which drives B cell maturation into plasma cells (Crotty, 2014). IL-1β has also recently been characterized to play an important role in Tfh effector cell development as well (Ritvo and Klatzmann, 2019). Therefore, reduced expression of both of these cytokines in combined GCR irradiation with HU may be indirectly linked to reduced B cell differentiation. In line with this, both GCR irradiation groups displayed a significant reduction in Th cells compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B and 4D). Although distinct effector T cell profiles, including Tfh, were not thoroughly characterized, Tfh effector cell lineage would have been included in these overall Th cell populations. Additionally, CD20 surface molecule expression on B cells is reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). However, we did not see any difference in cell surface expression of CD20 MFI (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells may be impaired in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared to NL-Sham controls. As B cell numbers are reduced (with no difference in CD20 surface expression) within GCR and SPE in combination with HU groups, there is a lower pool of antibody-production vehicles essential for effective humoral immunity. miRNA GO immune terms displayed reduced B cell differentiation and homeostasis in SPE irradiation and gamma irradiation, compared with HU-Sham controls, but was no different with GCR irradiation groups (Figure 7A), further suggesting distinct immune-related pathways are regulated following deep space simulations. Of interest, robust gene expression of Il-4 (Figure 6E), which is produced by Th2 and Tfh cells, directly promotes B cell maturation to plasma cells and ultimately the release of antibodies. Therefore, although initial B cell populations are reduced, functional output may be compensated for via robust expression of Il-4. LEO spaceflight missions have described minimal differences in B cell numbers and antibody production of IgG or IgM; however, IgA levels in flight were significantly upregulated compared with ground controls (Spielmann et al., 2019). This effect may be explained by the general effects of circulating miRNAs, as humoral immunity is predicted to be elevated by miRNAs (Danger et al., 2014; O'Connell et al., 2010). In our study, general upregulation of humoral responses are shown, yet multiple miRNA GO terms revealed that the humoral immune responses mediated by circulating Igs and B cells were suppressed with GCR combined with HU, compared to HU-Sham controls, further supporting humoral immunity may be dysregulated following deep space simulations (Figure 7A). Future studies addressing the level of Ig antibodies, B cell/plasma cell distribution, and circulating miRNAs involved during deep space missions would provide further insight into mechanisms involved in humoral immunity. A principal finding in our study was reduced expression of Th and Tc cells, compared to NL-Sham controls. As main components of the adaptive immune system, both Th and Tc cells provide the advantage of immunological memory and assist with humoral immunity, which are important to prevent recurrent infections and tumor development. This becomes particularly important during long-duration missions, where medial intervention is limited. Indeed, infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus reactivate during LEO spaceflight and are dependent on impaired cytotoxic T cells (Mehta et al., 2017; Nash, 2000). Furthermore, previous reports have indicated ionizing irradiation activates T cells (Schaue and McBride, 2012). However, the overall effect of ionizing irradiation on lymphocyte outcomes (i.e., activation or apoptosis) depends on multiple factors, most notably the dose and dose schedule (MacLennan and Kay, 1978; Schaue and McBride, 2012). For instance, preconditioning mice, i.e., irradiation for graft transplantation, relies on lethal bone marrow irradiation doses and fractionations to reduce lymphocyte counts (Bagley et al., 2002). In our study, GCR irradiation caused extensive reduction in both Th and Tc cells, compared with SPE or gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E), indicating GCR irradiation produced more damaging effects on these cell types. Inhomogeneous dose depth between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photon (gamma) tracks may be involved in this effect, as gamma irradiation exposure groups did not significantly affect Th or Tc numbers, compared with SPE and GCR irradiation groups. Thus, GCR and SPE irradiation may target deeper immune tissues, such as lymph nodes, where the majority of T naive and circulating T effector cells reside when not trafficking in the bloodstream (Hunter et al., 2016). The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes is dependent on the speed of DNA repair mechanisms relative to division, as non-proliferating cells are more radioresistant (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Radioresistance is observed in non-dividing cells as these cells are in G0 stage, during which DNA is compact and stable, protein-protected heterochromatin (Falk et al., 2008; Karagiannis et al., 2007). Proliferating lymphocytes, on the other hand, have exited the G0 stage and are in the DNA synthesis phase, which makes them more vulnerable to irradiation damage (Falk et al., 2008; Karagiannis et al., 2007). Cellular division requires correct, undamaged DNA to be copied to their progeny, and if repair mechanisms are not fast enough, elevated apoptosis results (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms for DNA repair are upregulated, indicating after exposure to deep space simulations, circulating miRNAs are involved in DNA repair machinery, whereby DNA damage has occurred (Figure 7B). Although we did not measure apoptosis directly, miRNA Hallmark terms also identified select apoptosis pathways were engaged during GCR irradiation exposures, compared to HU-Sham controls (Figure 7B), suggesting elevated DNA damage may be beyond repair, leading to apoptosis, following GCR irradiation conditions. We further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL-7R. As described above, IL-7R is expressed on naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Indeed, IL-7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls, suggesting T cell activation (Figure 5C). In line with this, Il7R knockout mice have significantly reduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocompromised (Peschon et al., 1994). This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations following simulated spaceflight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interestingly, miR-199a and miR-142–3p target Il7R (Luo and Fu, 2018), reducing its expression levels; however, in our report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012). For example, blocking IL-7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN-γ from memory cytotoxic T cells, limiting chronic inflammation (Belarif et al., 2018). In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduction of PI3K/AKT signaling and inflammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space exposures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure 7B). Alternatively, HU-Sham groups had elevated IL-7R MFI, which suggests elevated inflammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU-Sham controls displayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure 7B). Heightened ROS can cause inflammation both in spaceflight and on Earth (Crucian et al., 2018; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2017), which may be an associated mechanism involved during heightened inflammation in the HU-Sham groups. Therefore, IL-7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), Il-6 expression (Figure 6C), and ROS Hallmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure 7B) are all elevated in HU-Sham mice, further supporting inflammatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed inflammation via elevated IL-1β and IL-1α compared with pre-flight controls (Figure 8, Table S1). Importantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceflight, whereby the effects of ionizing irradiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure 8, Table S1), confirming inflammation is induced in LEO astronauts, similar to our ground HU model. Lymphopenia, or reduced T and B cell counts, poses a problem for adequate immunological protection against challenges (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Furthermore, lymphopenia recovery results in immune profiling changes that may be either detrimental or helpful to the host. In this report, compared to NL-Sham controls, robust induction of Il-4 following all ionizing irradiation groups combined with HU was noted. IL-4 is typically associated with Th2 effector cells, which are chiefly involved in allergic inflammation, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease (Nakayama et al., 2017). Interestingly, during spaceflight astronauts experience elevated allergic-like symptoms including rashes (Dunn et al., 2018) and hypersensitivity episodes (Voorhies et al., 2019). Therefore, Th2 immunity may be the principal immune response generated during deep space exposures; however, further evaluation of the type of Th cell subtypes produced in response to simulated deep space exposures are necessary. Deep spaceflight exposures present immunologically complicated outcomes. Synergistic inflammatory or immunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non-productive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell-to-cell transfer via exosomes) (Montagner et al., 2013; Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019) contribute to unique immune profiles, therefore miRNAs may be important for immune-targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving combined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would also be experienced during deep spaceflight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore, only a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal responses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct immune profiles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in combination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses in crew members may be required during long-duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Limitations of the Study In this study, we report the immune and miRNA differentials of mice following ground-based simulations of deep spaceflight, along with analyses of crew member inflammation in LEO. As this study utilized ground-based simulations in mice, deep spaceflight comparisons would be required to confirm similar profiles. Additionally, interpretation of whole-blood transcriptomics to specific cell types is limited in this study; however, these data provide insight into the overall cytokine profile induced by each condition that is independent of cell frequency. Furthermore, the contribution of miRNAs to the generated immune populations is described; however, an understanding into mechanism and/or functional outcomes would fully elucidate their role to overall immunity. In addition, the time point of collections was at an immediate response, yet the long-term response would also be of benefit, in particular, for long-duration missions. Finally, the comparisons between the immune differentials in mice and humans is a limitation; however, this study can give some insight into the significant immune population changes (i.e., T cytotoxic lymphocytes) that can be studied in humans during deep spaceflight mission in the near future.Resource Availability Lead Contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the Lead Contact, Afshin Beheshti, PhD (afshin.beheshti@nasa.gov).Materials Availability This study did not generate any unique reagents.Data and Code Availability The plasma miRNA-seq raw fastq files can be found on Database: NASA's GeneLab data repository/platform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/).

    "abstract": "Abstract Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.

    "introduction": "Introduction While the majority of spaceflight studies focus on the physiological responses during or immediately after flight, readaptation to nominal gravitational environments is also an important factor in astronaut health. This is particularly important for future exploratory missions to the Moon (0.166 g) or Mars (0.38 g) involving long-duration exposures to microgravity (0 g) and elevated doses of ionizing irradiation. Both the adaptation to spaceflight, and the readaptation to planetary gravitational environments, involve multiple physiological systems. Currently, short and the long-term consequences of prolonged exposure to deep spaceflight environments are largely unknown. There are several consequences to living in low-Earth orbit. These include edema due to fluid and cardiovascular deconditioning1, myelin degeneration2, disorientation and motor control deficits3,4, visual deficits5, endocrine and hormonal alterations6, muscle tone wasting7, and bone loss due to lack of mechanical loading8. Upon return to Earth, there is a period of readaptation that includes acute motion sickness, unsteadiness, imbalance due to gravity-induced vestibular fluid shifts9, and blood pressure changes10–12. Most notably, space anemia13,14 was re-classified as post-flight anemia, because of inconsistencies reported in key hematological parameters, including red blood cell (RBC) counts and mean corpuscular volumes (MPV). This was attributed to the timing of blood sample collections occurring at post-flight return versus in-flight retrieval10,14,15. Mission duration can also affect post-flight recovery, whereby longer missions result in prolonged recovery post-mission16. This becomes an important risk factor to consider for exploratory missions to Mars. Indeed, understanding how immune and hematological cells compensate in response to the changing gravitational environment becomes particularly important as crew currently rehabilitate to Earth’s gravity for multiple months post-flight17. Yet, this timeframe may be problematic on planetary bodies with reduced gravity. Therefore, a better understanding of blood differentials and their transcriptional regulatory patterns are essential for successful development of countermeasures to be used on future exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Ground-based models of spaceflight are developed to easily explore the impacts of the spaceflight environment on physiology. Indeed, we previously reported that a 21-day, protracted exposure of 0.04 Gy low dose/low dose rate gamma radiation (LDR), combined with hindlimb unloading (HLU), can have neurological impacts on blood–brain barrier integrity, the oxidative stress response, and neuroplasticity18–22. Here, we expand on this work, using RNA-sequencing of splenic tissues and complete blood cell (CBC) counts to characterize relevant immune and hematological pathways engaged after 1-week readaptation following simulated spaceflight conditions.",
    "methods": "Methods Experimental conditions Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimatized in standard habitats at 20 °C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for 7 days. Following acclimatization, animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (n = 6); (2) hindlimb unloaded (HLU) (n = 3); (3) low-dose irradiated (LDR, total dose 0.04 Gy) (n = 6); and (4) simSpace, combination of hindlimb unloaded and low-dose irradiated (HLU + LDR) (n = 6) for 21 days. Low-dose/low-dose rate was delivered using 57Co plates (a total dose of 0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) placed 7 cm below the cages, with 1 plate per 2 cages for whole-body irradiation. Uniformity of dose was ± 5%, as previously described18–22. Post-exposure animals were group housed (3 per cage) for 7-days. Commercial pellet chow (5LG4, LabDietR) and hydrogel were available ad libitum. Health status, water and food intake were daily monitored. After 7-day post-simSpace, mice were CO2 euthanized and spleens were collected and frozen. RNA was isolated from whole, frozen spleens and samples were subjected to whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing)18. Datasets were deposited to the NASA GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS)-211 and were analyzed using the NASA pipeline for determination of differentially expressed genes (DEG)23. All methods were performed in accordance with the guidelines recommended in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals57 and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines58. Complete blood count differential analysis Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2 at day seven after the simulated spaceflight period of 21-days. Whole blood was collected via cardiac punch in [K2]-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated syringes immediately following euthanasia and evaluated using the ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI, USA). Parameters characterized include red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT), and white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin concentration (HGB) and hematocrit (HCT, percentage of whole blood consisting of RBC). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV, mean volume per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; mean weight of hemoglobin per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC; concentration of hemoglobin per RBC), RBC distribution width (RDW; width of the RBC histogram produced by cell number x cell size), and the mean platelet volume (MPV; volume per cell) were also reported, along with absolute counts of granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes (× 106 cells/ml). Tissue collection and nucleic acid extraction Mice were humanely CO2 euthanized followed by immediate exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Spleens were isolated and placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at − 80 °C. Spleens were homogenized with CKMix (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) and a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) extracted RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA and DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at − 80 °C. RNA sequencing To construct RNA-sequencing libraries, an Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–96 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with RIN values > 8. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. cDNA (first and second strands) was synthesized from total RNA spiked with ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the appropriate ratio. Products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. Followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. For multiplexing, barcodes with unique indices out of 96, were used per sample. Custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice (NuGEN Technologies) was used for strand selection. Libraries were amplified by PCR (17 cycles) on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Mira Loma, CA, USA) to generate 15–30 M 75-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-211)23. Differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis With Cutadapt59 using the Trim Galore! wrapper, sequencing reads were trimmed. All reads were mapped with STAR60 and expressions were quantified and imported with RSEM61 and tximport62 respectively, into DESeq2 (R Bioconductor)63. Log2 fold-change (0.263) and adjusted p-value cutoffs (0.05) were used. All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Reactome version 6764 was used to detect enriched murine pathways. Volcano plots were generated using NASA’s GeneLab tool23. Murine spleen DEG that were orthologous to human blood gene-related diseases, as defined by GeneCards Human Gene Database and MalaCards Human Disease Databases, were identified. Using the Network Analyst Global EnrichNetwork tool, with parameters including the gene ontology: biological process (GO:BP) enrichment analysis database, large graph layout, and single node display (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/NetworkAnalyst/Secure/vis/ListEnrichment.xhtml), the blood gene-related gene list was mapped to determine common pathways. Statistical analysis Differential expression analysis was performed in R DESeq2. All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. A one-way ANOVA with post-hoc (Sidak) test was performed for the calculated coefficient of gene expression variation per gene. An unpaired, parametric t test with Welch’s correction was performed for all CBC parameters. A GitHub data analysis notebook was created and can be found here, https://github.com/jgalazka/GLDS-211_Paul_2021.",

Venn diagrams revealed no overlap of downregulated (Fig. 1B) nor upregulated (Fig. 1C) DEG. However, 33 genes were downregulated and 95 genes were upregulated in simulated spaceflight (simSpace) conditions combining LDR and HLU at 7-days post-exposure (Fig. 1B,C). In addition, the calculated coefficient of gene expression variation was determined for each experimental condition, which identified elevated variance in simSpace conditions (Fig. 1D). Figure 1.

Data represents n = 3–6 per group.As a secondary lymphoid organ, the spleen stores RNA-containing whole blood cells including white blood cells (WBC) or leukocytes, reticulated platelet and reticulocyte RBC, acting as a filter for circulating blood cells. Using NASA GeneLab’s volcano plot visualization tool with a maximum adjusted p-value of 0.05, statistically significant Log2 fold change of DEG (simSpace versus control) were plotted23 (Fig. 2A). Downregulated and upregulated genes associated with whole blood cell types include, CD19, H2-DMb2, Alox5, and RhD (Fig. 2B). The proportion of upregulated : downregulated DEG is approximately three : one (Fig. 2B). Collectively, 7-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions resulted in dysregulated immune and hematological system. Figure 2.

Seven-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions reveal multiple Reactome pathway involvement Murine Reactome pathway analysis was performed, which displayed pathways involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, DNA repair, and chromatin organization at 7-days post-simSpace exposure (Fig. 3). The majority of DEG fall within the signal transduction pathway including multiple solute carrier family, Slc genes involved in transporter signaling of sodium/potassium and cation elimination. Metabolism-related genes involved in liposome and glycoprotein formation were also highly upregulated, including Igf2r, B4galt2, and B4galt3 and the ubiquitin-pathways, including Ubap1, Fbxl22, and Ube2d2b. Cell cycle genes were also induced, including DEG associated with mitosis, such as Sssca1 and Kif24 and cytokinesis, such as Myh10 and Tor1aip1. Induction of DNA damage repair genes were also noted including, recombination repair genes, Swsap1 and Ippk and downregulation of DNA double stranded break repair gene, Ppp4r2. Figure 3.

Marginal immune modifications at 7-days post-simulated spaceflight Blood was collected 7-days post-simulated spaceflight and WBC were counted with an automated analyzer, which displayed no significant differences between control and simSpace for immune differentials including, platelets (Fig. 4A), mean platelet volume (MPV, Fig. 4B), WBC, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR, Fig. 4C). Spleen DEG were categorized to specific leukocyte subtypes (monocyte, granulocyte, or lymphocyte) by their known functional output (Fig. 4D). Collectively, the results showed although there were no significant differences in population distributions, there were significantly different DEG between controls and post-simSpace cohorts with functional associations to leukocyte subtype. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Splenic DEGs are altered post-simulated spaceflight, with minimal differences in immune population distributions in circulating blood. Whole blood was collected and platelets counts, × 103 per mm3 (A) and MPV, mean platelet volume per cell, femtolitre (fL) (B) are displayed. (C) White blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) are displayed for controls (orange) and simSpace (blue) conditions.

An unpaired, parametric t test with Welch’s correction was performed for (A–C), *p < 0.05. Alterations in hematological system at 7-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions CBC differentials were characterized by an automated hematological analyzer between control and post-simSpace cohorts. The results displayed significant reductions in RBC and hemoglobin (HGB) in post-simSpace cohorts, compared to controls (Fig. 5A,B). Significant increases in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), RBC distribution width (RDW), and MCV levels were revealed (Fig. 5C–E). No differences were noted between mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and hematocrit (HCT) levels (Fig. 5F,G). Murine spleen DEG that were orthologous to human blood disease/disorders markers, as defined by GeneCards Human Gene Database and MalaCards Human Disease Databases, were identified (Fig. 5H). Using the Network Analyst Global EnrichNetwork tool, blood disease/disorder markers were mapped to determine common pathways. The results showed three genes Bcl11a, Nedd4l, and Aspn had common pathways involved in regulation of blood pressure, protein modifications, transforming growth factor-β signaling, anatomical structure regulation, and negative regulation of developmental processes (Fig. 5I).

    "discussion": "Discussion Recovery post-spaceflight is systemically taxing and often leaves a lasting impression on human health. Circulating RBC and WBC interact with all physiological systems; therefore, a systems biology approach was applied to assess the effects of the immune and hematological outcomes post-simulated spaceflight (simSpace). Since astronaut collections are difficult to acquire, ground-based animal models are a useful alternative that provides valuable insight into these outcomes. Therefore, spleens and blood of mice were analyzed by RNAseq and hematological analyses, respectively, at 7-days post-simSpace. Previous studies in our lab have developed a simSpace model of low-dose radiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy) and hindlimb unloading (HLU) that mimics astronauts in-orbit on the International Space Station (ISS)18. Analyses at 7-days post-simSpace provide insight into the immediate early responses similarly experienced by crew during Earth readaptation, a critical time point of equalizing homeostasis. Hematological profiling revealed minimal disparities in WBC differentials, however RBC displayed a wide variation in morphology and disrupted function, including reduced overall numbers and hemoglobin levels, suggestive of anemia. Transcriptomic analysis of the spleen, which is the filter for circulating blood cells and a secondary lymphoid organ, displayed genes involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization and DNA repair pathways are altered. These analyses also revealed pathways connected to dysfunctional immunity and inflammation, including Cd19, Alox5, Trem1, and H2-DMb2 expression. Genes also implicated in blood disorders, including Bcl11a, Nedd4l, and Aspn, with common pathways involved in regulation of blood pressure, protein modifications, transforming growth factor regulation, and negative regulation of developmental pathways were identified. Thus, understanding immediate early immune and hematological pathways engaged post-simulated spaceflight sheds light on suitable timepoints for therapeutic intervention to promote homeostasis and restoration. DEG from spleens collected at 7-days post-simSpace were compared to single exposures of post-LDR or -HLU alone, which showed negligible overlap in genes (Fig. 1A–C), indicating distinct transcriptomic profiles are generated following each condition. Similar outcomes were also observed in our previous report that analyzed brain tissues at 4-months post-exposure18, indicating LDR, HLU, and simSpace independently trigger divergent pathways post-exposure. Interestingly, post-HLU appears to produce a large number of transcriptional changes compared to post-LDR alone, indicating altered gravity may cause pronounced physiological impairments. However, different doses and types of irradiation experienced on deep space missions would also cause distinct results24; therefore, future studies are aimed to delineate these transcriptional profiles as well. In addition, combined exposures of post-simSpace (HLU + LDR) compared to single exposures of post-HLU or post-LDR alone also created increased expression profile variability, which may account for reduced DEG observed in post-simSpace (Fig. 1D). A complete list of DEG for each condition is provided in supplemental information. We next wanted to determine DEG induced post-simSpace and found 33 genes were downregulated and 95 genes were upregulated, compared to controls (Fig. 2). Of note, no significant differences in overall body18 or spleen tissue weights (data not shown) were observed, supporting either minimal physiological effects occurred during simSpace or recovery post-simSpace has reached homeostasis. Reactome analysis identified five major functional pathways that were affected, including metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, DNA repair, and signal transduction (independent pathways from metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair) (Fig. 3). The majority of DEG were grouped as signal transduction genes, including a large fold upregulation of the cation transporter, Slc22a4. In fact, multiple Slc genes were upregulated post-simSpace, which are transporters of small molecules, including sodium/potassium and cation elimination, suggesting systemic electrolyte imbalance and potential dehydration. Of note, these ion channels are also mechanosensitive and regulate signaling pathways via physical forces they receive25. Therefore, more studies are required to better understand the contribution of these mechanosensitive transporter signaling pathways during- and post-simSpace. We and others have identified the oxidative stress response as a major pathway engaged during spaceflight26–28, while metabolic syndromes and ageing are also linked to oxidative stress29. In this study, multiple genes involved in metabolism were upregulated, including the insulin signaling receptor, Igf2r. Additionally, glycoprotein forming genes, B4galt2 and B4galt3 were both upregulated, suggesting heightened glycoprotein synthesis. Cell cycle pathways were also altered, including upregulation of genes Sccca1, Kif24, Myh10, and Tor1aip1. These DEG are involved in mitosis and meiosis via microtubule formation and cytokinesis, suggesting increased cellular turnover and division post-simSpace. Chromatin organization and remodeling genes Chd3 and Ncoa3 downregulation were also identified. Furthermore, Swsap1, Ift57, and Ippk genes were upregulated, indicating DNA repair mechanisms occur post-simSpace. Collectively, multiple DEG pathways were actively engaged at 7-days post-simSpace, indicating a dynamic and constant healing process seeking homeostasis. Immune-related genes were grouped according to their cellular function. Myeloid cell (monocyte and granulocyte)-related genes included downregulation of Card11, Sf3b1, H2-DMb2, Vps39, Ccdc50, and Pcm1; while SphK1, Trem1, and Alox5 were upregulated (Fig. 4D). H2-DMb2 is part of the MHC complex involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes30. Downregulation of this gene would imply impaired antigen presentation and deficient immunological activation; however, this may be an important mechanism post-simSpace to dull the immune response, as recovery should be devoid of self-antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, downregulation of Vps39 (involved in fusion of endosomes/lysosomes) suggests phagocytosis impairment31. In line with this, impairment of neutrophil phagocytosis is observed up to 3-days post-spaceflight32,33, suggesting a possible role for downregulated Vps39 in this process. The transcription factor NFκB activates a wide variety of signaling pathways involved in immune activation, inflammation, and cytokine production34. Card11 and Ccdc50 are both regulators of NFκB signaling. Their expression levels are downregulated, indicating dysregulated immunity. In addition, Alox5 is typically upregulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, GM-CSF, involved in the generation of emergency myelopoiesis and activates matured myeloid cells into a pro-inflammatory state35. Therefore, Alox5 upregulation suggests a proinflammatory environment predominates post-simSpace. In line with this, Trem1 is upregulated and is involved in amplifying inflammation of neutrophils and monocytes36. Indeed, Trem1 inhibition has been successfully shown to prevent mir-155-driven lung inflammation and injury37, septic shock38, and neuroinflammation39. Trem1 is expressed in neutrophils, which are granulocytes40. Elevated granulocytes and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) has been identified as a biomarker for inflight immune monitoring26,41, therefore, it is plausible that Trem1 induction may also be a determinant for inflight inflammation. Acute inflammation is beneficial in the face of immunological challenges, such as infections or tumors, yet chronic persistence, specifically post-exposures can be detrimental to the host. Resolution of inflammation does not appear to occur at 7-days post-simSpace, suggesting the potential disease development42. Furthermore, although correlation of Alox5 and Trem1 expression levels and severity of inflammation is not clear, monitoring Alox5 and Trem1 upregulation may be useful biomarkers to measure chronic inflammation in future spaceflight studies. Lymphocytes play an important role in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Notable DEG altered post-simSpace, included downregulation of Sla, Cd19, Pikap1, Kbtbd8, Pcm1, Card11, and Cccdc50; and upregulation of Sphk1 and Zfp341 (Fig. 4D). Of note, Sla negatively regulates TcR signaling, which may contribute to issues during positive selection and non-specific antigen-immunity43. Indeed, T cell function is impaired during- and post-spaceflight44,45, therefore supporting identification of gene pathways involved in this process for future studies. Additionally, Cd19 and Pik3ap1, are involved in B cell phenotypes, including development and BcR signaling46,47, therefore downregulation suggests deficiency in humoral immunity. Certainly, B cells are impacted by ground-based deep space simulation models24 and post-spaceflight48. Further, activation of splenocytes collected 3-days post-flight produced a robust elevation of the inflammatory chemokine MIP-1α, further supporting a proinflammatory state post-spaceflight44. Yet, the overall contribution of immune responses on whole-organism physiology cannot be fully concluded until longitudinal phenotypic studies are performed, as mission timeframes vary, ground-model conditions and exposure timeframes are non-standardized, and post-mission/model tissue collections differ, which can all result in different interpretations. Nonetheless, altered immunity is recognized across multiple in-flight, at readaptation, and in ground-based models of spaceflight, suggesting a need to delineate all potential mechanisms involved, and strongly supports the need for personalized medicine for future crewmembers. CBC indicated no differences in WBC counts, which may be due to either group-housing effects on cell distribution49 or homeostasis is established at this time point post-simSpace. There were, however, significant reductions in overall RBC numbers and HGB levels (Fig. 5A,B). These results suggest at 7-days post-simSpace anemic conditions persist, which may explain post-flight etiology during return to Earth’s gravity in crewmembers9–11. Other parameters showed no significant differences including, MCHC and HCT (Fig. 5D,E). However, significantly increased levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), RBC distribution width (RDW), and MCV (Fig. 5C,F,G). Collectively, abnormal RBC shape suggest anemic outcomes occurred post-simSpace. Furthermore, both elevated or reduced values of MCH, RDW, and MCV indicate abnormal size and volume of RBC, which impacts hemoglobin function and oxygen carrying capacity, contributing to anemic states50,51. An elevated RDW can also contribute to cardiovascular and cancer risk52, highlighting the necessity to normalize these biomarkers during post-flight readaptation. Interestingly, elevated RDW may be caused by elevated inflammation53, which is also observed in our model, therefore targeting inflammation early post-flight may avert cardiovascular- or cancer-related risks. In line with this, RDW was the only hematological marker that remained elevated at 30-days post-simSpace, while reaching homeostasis at 270-days post-simSpace (data not shown), suggesting the importance of regulating this biomarker in particular for future spaceflight studies. Since RBC do not contain a nucleus and thus genetic material, the majority of blood disease/disorder genes are likely pooled from DNA-containing immature RBC or reticulocytes, immature platelets or reticulated platelets, WBC, and other cells of the spleen, including mesothelial cells and smooth muscle cells54. Using Malacards Human Disease Database, outstanding blood disease/disorder orthologs including, upregulated Tmem184a, Daam2, Ippk, Aspn, RhD, and Igf2r; and downregulated Nedd4l and Bcl11a were identified (Fig. 5H). For one, an elevated RhD (Rh factor antigen) was noted post-simSpace, which may have been induced due to RBC loss, as Rh(null) phenotypes are associated with hemolytic anemia55. As it is unclear if anemia was induced during- or post-simSpace in our model, and due to the complex definition of space/post-flight anemia, more studies are required. Nonetheless, while determining the timeframe of anemia onset is important, we propose the potential for prolonged and pronounced anemia manifestation in astronauts on partial gravity surfaces of the Moon and Mars, following long duration, deep space travel. Therefore, identifying biomarkers to assist with future countermeasure developments to help safeguard astronauts on future deep space missions is critical. Interestingly, pathway analysis implicated Bcl11a, Aspn, and Nedd4l are interconnected and regulate a wide variety of pathways including, blood pressure, B cell differentiation, and TGF-βR signaling (Fig. 5I). Due to fluidic shifting and reduced normal loading in spaceflight, astronauts returned to Earth are at an increased risk of low blood pressure when standing12 and arterial stiffening56. Therefore, targeting these interconnected genes may provide a robust countermeasure suited to reverse both immune and cardiovascular disparities during readaptation. We recognize complex pathways depend on multiple genes for function. Therefore, differential gene expression of a few may not disrupt biological phenotypes, and as such additional studies are required to assess functional consequences. Furthermore, physiological responses depend on multiple gene expressions within collective pathways; therefore, a thorough survey of the pan-transcriptomic landscape is required to construct reliable countermeasures. In brief, this study identified key DEG and DEG pathways engaged in systemic blood circulation via spleen transcriptome and CBC differential analyses at 7-days post-simSpace. Primary responses include persistent inflammation and anemia are protracted up to 7-days post-simSpace. Limitations of this study include restricted cross-translation to humans, lack of baseline and longitudinal results, and absence of galactic cosmic ray radiation testing parameters. Nonetheless, future space biology queries can be generated from this study. Furthermore, this study highlights the requisite of systemic homeostasis upon return to Earth’s gravity and describes options for recourse during reduced gravity experiences. In brief, comprehensive and dynamic outcomes of the immune and hematological systems occur 7-days post-protracted simulated spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 8169688 PMID: 34075076 Abstract Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.

This is particularly important for future exploratory missions to the Moon (0.166 g) or Mars (0.38 g) involving long-duration exposures to microgravity (0 g) and elevated doses of ionizing irradiation. Both the adaptation to spaceflight, and the readaptation to planetary gravitational environments, involve multiple physiological systems. Currently, short and the long-term consequences of prolonged exposure to deep spaceflight environments are largely unknown. There are several consequences to living in low-Earth orbit. These include edema due to fluid and cardiovascular deconditioning1, myelin degeneration2, disorientation and motor control deficits3,4, visual deficits5, endocrine and hormonal alterations6, muscle tone wasting7, and bone loss due to lack of mechanical loading8. Upon return to Earth, there is a period of readaptation that includes acute motion sickness, unsteadiness, imbalance due to gravity-induced vestibular fluid shifts9, and blood pressure changes10–12. Most notably, space anemia13,14 was re-classified as post-flight anemia, because of inconsistencies reported in key hematological parameters, including red blood cell (RBC) counts and mean corpuscular volumes (MPV). This was attributed to the timing of blood sample collections occurring at post-flight return versus in-flight retrieval10,14,15. Mission duration can also affect post-flight recovery, whereby longer missions result in prolonged recovery post-mission16. This becomes an important risk factor to consider for exploratory missions to Mars. Indeed, understanding how immune and hematological cells compensate in response to the changing gravitational environment becomes particularly important as crew currently rehabilitate to Earth’s gravity for multiple months post-flight17. Yet, this timeframe may be problematic on planetary bodies with reduced gravity. Therefore, a better understanding of blood differentials and their transcriptional regulatory patterns are essential for successful development of countermeasures to be used on future exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Ground-based models of spaceflight are developed to easily explore the impacts of the spaceflight environment on physiology. Indeed, we previously reported that a 21-day, protracted exposure of 0.04 Gy low dose/low dose rate gamma radiation (LDR), combined with hindlimb unloading (HLU), can have neurological impacts on blood–brain barrier integrity, the oxidative stress response, and neuroplasticity18–22. Here, we expand on this work, using RNA-sequencing of splenic tissues and complete blood cell (CBC) counts to characterize relevant immune and hematological pathways engaged after 1-week readaptation following simulated spaceflight conditions.Results Seven-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions result in distinct gene expression profiles Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated with each cohort (Fig. 1A). Venn diagrams revealed no overlap of downregulated (Fig. 1B) nor upregulated (Fig. 1C) DEG. However, 33 genes were downregulated and 95 genes were upregulated in simulated spaceflight (simSpace) conditions combining LDR and HLU at 7-days post-exposure (Fig. 1B,C). In addition, the calculated coefficient of gene expression variation was determined for each experimental condition, which identified elevated variance in simSpace conditions (Fig. 1D). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Post-simulated spaceflight conditions display distinct transcriptomics. Mice spleens collected 7-days following hindlimb unloading (HLU, green), low-dose irradiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy total dose, yellow), and combined HLU and LDR (simSpace, blue) for 21-days, compared to controls (orange).

(D) Calculated coefficient of gene expression variation (CV) per gene plotted against the Log2 of the mean normalized count for that gene (+ 1) in each group. A one-way ANOVA with post hoc pairwise t tests (using step-down method, Sidak for adjusting p values) was performed in (D). Data represents n = 3–6 per group.As a secondary lymphoid organ, the spleen stores RNA-containing whole blood cells including white blood cells (WBC) or leukocytes, reticulated platelet and reticulocyte RBC, acting as a filter for circulating blood cells. Using NASA GeneLab’s volcano plot visualization tool with a maximum adjusted p-value of 0.05, statistically significant Log2 fold change of DEG (simSpace versus control) were plotted23 (Fig. 2A). Downregulated and upregulated genes associated with whole blood cell types include, CD19, H2-DMb2, Alox5, and RhD (Fig. 2B). The proportion of upregulated : downregulated DEG is approximately three : one (Fig. 2B). Collectively, 7-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions resulted in dysregulated immune and hematological system. Figure 2.

Data represents n = 6 per group.Seven-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions reveal multiple Reactome pathway involvement Murine Reactome pathway analysis was performed, which displayed pathways involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, DNA repair, and chromatin organization at 7-days post-simSpace exposure (Fig. 3). The majority of DEG fall within the signal transduction pathway including multiple solute carrier family, Slc genes involved in transporter signaling of sodium/potassium and cation elimination. Metabolism-related genes involved in liposome and glycoprotein formation were also highly upregulated, including Igf2r, B4galt2, and B4galt3 and the ubiquitin-pathways, including Ubap1, Fbxl22, and Ube2d2b. Cell cycle genes were also induced, including DEG associated with mitosis, such as Sssca1 and Kif24 and cytokinesis, such as Myh10 and Tor1aip1. Induction of DNA damage repair genes were also noted including, recombination repair genes, Swsap1 and Ippk and downregulation of DNA double stranded break repair gene, Ppp4r2. Figure 3.

Abridged Reactome pathway analyses of enriched DEG. Bar graphs of significant up (yellow) and down (purple) DEG (Log2 fold change, FC) (p > 0.05). Reactome pathways include, signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, DNA repair, and chromatin organization. Data represents n = 6 per group.Marginal immune modifications at 7-days post-simulated spaceflight Blood was collected 7-days post-simulated spaceflight and WBC were counted with an automated analyzer, which displayed no significant differences between control and simSpace for immune differentials including, platelets (Fig. 4A), mean platelet volume (MPV, Fig. 4B), WBC, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR, Fig. 4C). Spleen DEG were categorized to specific leukocyte subtypes (monocyte, granulocyte, or lymphocyte) by their known functional output (Fig. 4D). Collectively, the results showed although there were no significant differences in population distributions, there were significantly different DEG between controls and post-simSpace cohorts with functional associations to leukocyte subtype. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Splenic DEGs are altered post-simulated spaceflight, with minimal differences in immune population distributions in circulating blood. Whole blood was collected and platelets counts, × 103 per mm3 (A) and MPV, mean platelet volume per cell, femtolitre (fL) (B) are displayed. (C) White blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) are displayed for controls (orange) and simSpace (blue) conditions. (D) Significant upregulated and downregulated DEG (Log2 fold change) are displayed for each WBC subtype. Cell numbers were normalized to controls. Data represents ± SEM, n = 6 per group. An unpaired, parametric t test with Welch’s correction was performed for (A–C), *p < 0.05.Alterations in hematological system at 7-days post-simulated spaceflight conditions CBC differentials were characterized by an automated hematological analyzer between control and post-simSpace cohorts. The results displayed significant reductions in RBC and hemoglobin (HGB) in post-simSpace cohorts, compared to controls (Fig. 5A,B). Significant increases in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), RBC distribution width (RDW), and MCV levels were revealed (Fig. 5C–E). No differences were noted between mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and hematocrit (HCT) levels (Fig. 5F,G). Murine spleen DEG that were orthologous to human blood disease/disorders markers, as defined by GeneCards Human Gene Database and MalaCards Human Disease Databases, were identified (Fig. 5H). Using the Network Analyst Global EnrichNetwork tool, blood disease/disorder markers were mapped to determine common pathways. The results showed three genes Bcl11a, Nedd4l, and Aspn had common pathways involved in regulation of blood pressure, protein modifications, transforming growth factor-β signaling, anatomical structure regulation, and negative regulation of developmental processes (Fig. 5I). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Distinct hematological gene expressions in spleens and red blood cell distributions in circulating blood post-simulated spaceflight.

An unpaired, parametric t test with Welch’s correction was performed for (A–G), *p < 0.05.Discussion Recovery post-spaceflight is systemically taxing and often leaves a lasting impression on human health. Circulating RBC and WBC interact with all physiological systems; therefore, a systems biology approach was applied to assess the effects of the immune and hematological outcomes post-simulated spaceflight (simSpace). Since astronaut collections are difficult to acquire, ground-based animal models are a useful alternative that provides valuable insight into these outcomes. Therefore, spleens and blood of mice were analyzed by RNAseq and hematological analyses, respectively, at 7-days post-simSpace. Previous studies in our lab have developed a simSpace model of low-dose radiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy) and hindlimb unloading (HLU) that mimics astronauts in-orbit on the International Space Station (ISS)18. Analyses at 7-days post-simSpace provide insight into the immediate early responses similarly experienced by crew during Earth readaptation, a critical time point of equalizing homeostasis. Hematological profiling revealed minimal disparities in WBC differentials, however RBC displayed a wide variation in morphology and disrupted function, including reduced overall numbers and hemoglobin levels, suggestive of anemia. Transcriptomic analysis of the spleen, which is the filter for circulating blood cells and a secondary lymphoid organ, displayed genes involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization and DNA repair pathways are altered. These analyses also revealed pathways connected to dysfunctional immunity and inflammation, including Cd19, Alox5, Trem1, and H2-DMb2 expression. Genes also implicated in blood disorders, including Bcl11a, Nedd4l, and Aspn, with common pathways involved in regulation of blood pressure, protein modifications, transforming growth factor regulation, and negative regulation of developmental pathways were identified. Thus, understanding immediate early immune and hematological pathways engaged post-simulated spaceflight sheds light on suitable timepoints for therapeutic intervention to promote homeostasis and restoration. DEG from spleens collected at 7-days post-simSpace were compared to single exposures of post-LDR or -HLU alone, which showed negligible overlap in genes (Fig. 1A–C), indicating distinct transcriptomic profiles are generated following each condition. Similar outcomes were also observed in our previous report that analyzed brain tissues at 4-months post-exposure18, indicating LDR, HLU, and simSpace independently trigger divergent pathways post-exposure. Interestingly, post-HLU appears to produce a large number of transcriptional changes compared to post-LDR alone, indicating altered gravity may cause pronounced physiological impairments. However, different doses and types of irradiation experienced on deep space missions would also cause distinct results24; therefore, future studies are aimed to delineate these transcriptional profiles as well. In addition, combined exposures of post-simSpace (HLU + LDR) compared to single exposures of post-HLU or post-LDR alone also created increased expression profile variability, which may account for reduced DEG observed in post-simSpace (Fig. 1D). A complete list of DEG for each condition is provided in supplemental information. We next wanted to determine DEG induced post-simSpace and found 33 genes were downregulated and 95 genes were upregulated, compared to controls (Fig. 2). Of note, no significant differences in overall body18 or spleen tissue weights (data not shown) were observed, supporting either minimal physiological effects occurred during simSpace or recovery post-simSpace has reached homeostasis. Reactome analysis identified five major functional pathways that were affected, including metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, DNA repair, and signal transduction (independent pathways from metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair) (Fig. 3). The majority of DEG were grouped as signal transduction genes, including a large fold upregulation of the cation transporter, Slc22a4. In fact, multiple Slc genes were upregulated post-simSpace, which are transporters of small molecules, including sodium/potassium and cation elimination, suggesting systemic electrolyte imbalance and potential dehydration. Of note, these ion channels are also mechanosensitive and regulate signaling pathways via physical forces they receive25. Therefore, more studies are required to better understand the contribution of these mechanosensitive transporter signaling pathways during- and post-simSpace. We and others have identified the oxidative stress response as a major pathway engaged during spaceflight26–28, while metabolic syndromes and ageing are also linked to oxidative stress29. In this study, multiple genes involved in metabolism were upregulated, including the insulin signaling receptor, Igf2r. Additionally, glycoprotein forming genes, B4galt2 and B4galt3 were both upregulated, suggesting heightened glycoprotein synthesis. Cell cycle pathways were also altered, including upregulation of genes Sccca1, Kif24, Myh10, and Tor1aip1. These DEG are involved in mitosis and meiosis via microtubule formation and cytokinesis, suggesting increased cellular turnover and division post-simSpace. Chromatin organization and remodeling genes Chd3 and Ncoa3 downregulation were also identified. Furthermore, Swsap1, Ift57, and Ippk genes were upregulated, indicating DNA repair mechanisms occur post-simSpace. Collectively, multiple DEG pathways were actively engaged at 7-days post-simSpace, indicating a dynamic and constant healing process seeking homeostasis. Immune-related genes were grouped according to their cellular function. Myeloid cell (monocyte and granulocyte)-related genes included downregulation of Card11, Sf3b1, H2-DMb2, Vps39, Ccdc50, and Pcm1; while SphK1, Trem1, and Alox5 were upregulated (Fig. 4D). H2-DMb2 is part of the MHC complex involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes30. Downregulation of this gene would imply impaired antigen presentation and deficient immunological activation; however, this may be an important mechanism post-simSpace to dull the immune response, as recovery should be devoid of self-antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, downregulation of Vps39 (involved in fusion of endosomes/lysosomes) suggests phagocytosis impairment31. In line with this, impairment of neutrophil phagocytosis is observed up to 3-days post-spaceflight32,33, suggesting a possible role for downregulated Vps39 in this process. The transcription factor NFκB activates a wide variety of signaling pathways involved in immune activation, inflammation, and cytokine production34. Card11 and Ccdc50 are both regulators of NFκB signaling. Their expression levels are downregulated, indicating dysregulated immunity. In addition, Alox5 is typically upregulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, GM-CSF, involved in the generation of emergency myelopoiesis and activates matured myeloid cells into a pro-inflammatory state35. Therefore, Alox5 upregulation suggests a proinflammatory environment predominates post-simSpace. In line with this, Trem1 is upregulated and is involved in amplifying inflammation of neutrophils and monocytes36. Indeed, Trem1 inhibition has been successfully shown to prevent mir-155-driven lung inflammation and injury37, septic shock38, and neuroinflammation39. Trem1 is expressed in neutrophils, which are granulocytes40. Elevated granulocytes and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) has been identified as a biomarker for inflight immune monitoring26,41, therefore, it is plausible that Trem1 induction may also be a determinant for inflight inflammation. Acute inflammation is beneficial in the face of immunological challenges, such as infections or tumors, yet chronic persistence, specifically post-exposures can be detrimental to the host. Resolution of inflammation does not appear to occur at 7-days post-simSpace, suggesting the potential disease development42. Furthermore, although correlation of Alox5 and Trem1 expression levels and severity of inflammation is not clear, monitoring Alox5 and Trem1 upregulation may be useful biomarkers to measure chronic inflammation in future spaceflight studies. Lymphocytes play an important role in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Notable DEG altered post-simSpace, included downregulation of Sla, Cd19, Pikap1, Kbtbd8, Pcm1, Card11, and Cccdc50; and upregulation of Sphk1 and Zfp341 (Fig. 4D). Of note, Sla negatively regulates TcR signaling, which may contribute to issues during positive selection and non-specific antigen-immunity43. Indeed, T cell function is impaired during- and post-spaceflight44,45, therefore supporting identification of gene pathways involved in this process for future studies. Additionally, Cd19 and Pik3ap1, are involved in B cell phenotypes, including development and BcR signaling46,47, therefore downregulation suggests deficiency in humoral immunity. Certainly, B cells are impacted by ground-based deep space simulation models24 and post-spaceflight48. Further, activation of splenocytes collected 3-days post-flight produced a robust elevation of the inflammatory chemokine MIP-1α, further supporting a proinflammatory state post-spaceflight44. Yet, the overall contribution of immune responses on whole-organism physiology cannot be fully concluded until longitudinal phenotypic studies are performed, as mission timeframes vary, ground-model conditions and exposure timeframes are non-standardized, and post-mission/model tissue collections differ, which can all result in different interpretations. Nonetheless, altered immunity is recognized across multiple in-flight, at readaptation, and in ground-based models of spaceflight, suggesting a need to delineate all potential mechanisms involved, and strongly supports the need for personalized medicine for future crewmembers. CBC indicated no differences in WBC counts, which may be due to either group-housing effects on cell distribution49 or homeostasis is established at this time point post-simSpace. There were, however, significant reductions in overall RBC numbers and HGB levels (Fig. 5A,B). These results suggest at 7-days post-simSpace anemic conditions persist, which may explain post-flight etiology during return to Earth’s gravity in crewmembers9–11. Other parameters showed no significant differences including, MCHC and HCT (Fig. 5D,E). However, significantly increased levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), RBC distribution width (RDW), and MCV (Fig. 5C,F,G). Collectively, abnormal RBC shape suggest anemic outcomes occurred post-simSpace. Furthermore, both elevated or reduced values of MCH, RDW, and MCV indicate abnormal size and volume of RBC, which impacts hemoglobin function and oxygen carrying capacity, contributing to anemic states50,51. An elevated RDW can also contribute to cardiovascular and cancer risk52, highlighting the necessity to normalize these biomarkers during post-flight readaptation. Interestingly, elevated RDW may be caused by elevated inflammation53, which is also observed in our model, therefore targeting inflammation early post-flight may avert cardiovascular- or cancer-related risks. In line with this, RDW was the only hematological marker that remained elevated at 30-days post-simSpace, while reaching homeostasis at 270-days post-simSpace (data not shown), suggesting the importance of regulating this biomarker in particular for future spaceflight studies. Since RBC do not contain a nucleus and thus genetic material, the majority of blood disease/disorder genes are likely pooled from DNA-containing immature RBC or reticulocytes, immature platelets or reticulated platelets, WBC, and other cells of the spleen, including mesothelial cells and smooth muscle cells54. Using Malacards Human Disease Database, outstanding blood disease/disorder orthologs including, upregulated Tmem184a, Daam2, Ippk, Aspn, RhD, and Igf2r; and downregulated Nedd4l and Bcl11a were identified (Fig. 5H). For one, an elevated RhD (Rh factor antigen) was noted post-simSpace, which may have been induced due to RBC loss, as Rh(null) phenotypes are associated with hemolytic anemia55. As it is unclear if anemia was induced during- or post-simSpace in our model, and due to the complex definition of space/post-flight anemia, more studies are required. Nonetheless, while determining the timeframe of anemia onset is important, we propose the potential for prolonged and pronounced anemia manifestation in astronauts on partial gravity surfaces of the Moon and Mars, following long duration, deep space travel. Therefore, identifying biomarkers to assist with future countermeasure developments to help safeguard astronauts on future deep space missions is critical. Interestingly, pathway analysis implicated Bcl11a, Aspn, and Nedd4l are interconnected and regulate a wide variety of pathways including, blood pressure, B cell differentiation, and TGF-βR signaling (Fig. 5I). Due to fluidic shifting and reduced normal loading in spaceflight, astronauts returned to Earth are at an increased risk of low blood pressure when standing12 and arterial stiffening56. Therefore, targeting these interconnected genes may provide a robust countermeasure suited to reverse both immune and cardiovascular disparities during readaptation. We recognize complex pathways depend on multiple genes for function. Therefore, differential gene expression of a few may not disrupt biological phenotypes, and as such additional studies are required to assess functional consequences. Furthermore, physiological responses depend on multiple gene expressions within collective pathways; therefore, a thorough survey of the pan-transcriptomic landscape is required to construct reliable countermeasures. In brief, this study identified key DEG and DEG pathways engaged in systemic blood circulation via spleen transcriptome and CBC differential analyses at 7-days post-simSpace. Primary responses include persistent inflammation and anemia are protracted up to 7-days post-simSpace. Limitations of this study include restricted cross-translation to humans, lack of baseline and longitudinal results, and absence of galactic cosmic ray radiation testing parameters. Nonetheless, future space biology queries can be generated from this study. Furthermore, this study highlights the requisite of systemic homeostasis upon return to Earth’s gravity and describes options for recourse during reduced gravity experiences. In brief, comprehensive and dynamic outcomes of the immune and hematological systems occur 7-days post-protracted simulated spaceflight.Methods Experimental conditions Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimatized in standard habitats at 20 °C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for 7 days. Following acclimatization, animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (n = 6); (2) hindlimb unloaded (HLU) (n = 3); (3) low-dose irradiated (LDR, total dose 0.04 Gy) (n = 6); and (4) simSpace, combination of hindlimb unloaded and low-dose irradiated (HLU + LDR) (n = 6) for 21 days. Low-dose/low-dose rate was delivered using 57Co plates (a total dose of 0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) placed 7 cm below the cages, with 1 plate per 2 cages for whole-body irradiation. Uniformity of dose was ± 5%, as previously described18–22. Post-exposure animals were group housed (3 per cage) for 7-days. Commercial pellet chow (5LG4, LabDietR) and hydrogel were available ad libitum. Health status, water and food intake were daily monitored. After 7-day post-simSpace, mice were CO2 euthanized and spleens were collected and frozen. RNA was isolated from whole, frozen spleens and samples were subjected to whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing)18. Datasets were deposited to the NASA GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS)-211 and were analyzed using the NASA pipeline for determination of differentially expressed genes (DEG)23. All methods were performed in accordance with the guidelines recommended in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals57 and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines58.Complete blood count differential analysis Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2 at day seven after the simulated spaceflight period of 21-days. Whole blood was collected via cardiac punch in [K2]-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated syringes immediately following euthanasia and evaluated using the ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI, USA). Parameters characterized include red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT), and white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin concentration (HGB) and hematocrit (HCT, percentage of whole blood consisting of RBC). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV, mean volume per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; mean weight of hemoglobin per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC; concentration of hemoglobin per RBC), RBC distribution width (RDW; width of the RBC histogram produced by cell number x cell size), and the mean platelet volume (MPV; volume per cell) were also reported, along with absolute counts of granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes (× 106 cells/ml).Tissue collection and nucleic acid extraction Mice were humanely CO2 euthanized followed by immediate exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Spleens were isolated and placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at − 80 °C. Spleens were homogenized with CKMix (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) and a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) extracted RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA and DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at − 80 °C.RNA sequencing To construct RNA-sequencing libraries, an Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–96 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with RIN values > 8. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. cDNA (first and second strands) was synthesized from total RNA spiked with ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the appropriate ratio. Products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. Followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. For multiplexing, barcodes with unique indices out of 96, were used per sample. Custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice (NuGEN Technologies) was used for strand selection. Libraries were amplified by PCR (17 cycles) on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Mira Loma, CA, USA) to generate 15–30 M 75-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-211)23.Differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis With Cutadapt59 using the Trim Galore! wrapper, sequencing reads were trimmed. All reads were mapped with STAR60 and expressions were quantified and imported with RSEM61 and tximport62 respectively, into DESeq2 (R Bioconductor)63. Log2 fold-change (0.263) and adjusted p-value cutoffs (0.05) were used. All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Reactome version 6764 was used to detect enriched murine pathways. Volcano plots were generated using NASA’s GeneLab tool23. Murine spleen DEG that were orthologous to human blood gene-related diseases, as defined by GeneCards Human Gene Database and MalaCards Human Disease Databases, were identified. Using the Network Analyst Global EnrichNetwork tool, with parameters including the gene ontology: biological process (GO:BP) enrichment analysis database, large graph layout, and single node display (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/NetworkAnalyst/Secure/vis/ListEnrichment.xhtml), the blood gene-related gene list was mapped to determine common pathways.Statistical analysis Differential expression analysis was performed in R DESeq2. All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. A one-way ANOVA with post-hoc (Sidak) test was performed for the calculated coefficient of gene expression variation per gene. An unpaired, parametric t test with Welch’s correction was performed for all CBC parameters.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5. Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g., Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010; Sewelam et al., 2014; Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g., Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2018). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g., Labra et al., 2002; Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010; Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011; Bilichak et al., 2012; Colaneri and Jones, 2013; Tricker et al., 2013; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015, 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017, 2018; Bartels et al., 2018; Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018; Beyrne et al., 2019; Ashapkin et al., 2020; Akhter et al., 2021; Korotko et al., 2021; Laanen et al., 2021; Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling (Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Blancaflor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014; Nakashima et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Ferl and Paul, 2016; Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020; Califar et al., 2020; Kruse et al., 2020; Angelos et al., 2021; Manian et al., 2021b). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (Xu et al., 2018). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs; Zhou et al., 2019). The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs; Zhou et al., 2019). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments (Huang et al., 2019). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response (Dowen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Tameshige et al., 2015; Jarosz et al., 2020). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight (Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Herranz et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020; Califar et al., 2020; Manian et al., 2021a). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight? DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context (Chevalier et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2012; Pikaard, 2013). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct de novo DNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V (Matzke et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts (Zhong et al., 2014). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases. The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites (Kankel et al., 2003; Rigal et al., 2016). MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses (Naydenov et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015; Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020). The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes (Saze et al., 2003). Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections (Kankel et al., 2003; Dowen et al., 2012). Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutant met1-3 lines (Supplementary Material, Dowen et al., 2012) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019) including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis (Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1. The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Nelissen et al., 2005; Glatt and Muller, 2013; Ding and Mou, 2015; Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function (Ding and Mou, 2015) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g., Glatt and Muller, 2013; Jarosz et al., 2020). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response (Woloszynska et al., 2016). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g., Xie and Yu, 2015), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in: Jarosz et al., 2020). ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., Wang et al., 2013) and plays a role in root development (e.g., Jia et al., 2015), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation (DeFraia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription (DeFraia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development (Jia et al., 2015) and auxin signaling (Nelissen et al., 2010). Many of the genes differentially expressed between elp2 mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses (Zhou et al., 2009). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed in elp2 mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g., Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants. The Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EPEX) spaceflight experiment reported herein investigated the contribution of epigenomic changes in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, specifically the role of cytosine DNA methylation in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis. The experiment was conducted onboard the ISS to evaluate the spaceflight responses of the methylation mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 compared to the Col-0 wild-type background of both mutant lines. Growth patterns, genome-wide methylation profiles, and differential gene expression profiles were used to develop an integrated assessment of the interplay of DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation in the response to spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Material and Experimental Design Three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) were used: Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type (TAIR CS70000), and Col-0 mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 genotype. Mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 previously described in Kanno et al. (2008), Guo et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2013), and were kindly provided by Dr. Zhonglin Mou (Wang et al., 2013). Sterilized seeds from each line were sown aseptically onto Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5 × Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, and then sealed with breathable tape (3M Micropore®, Maplewood, MN, United States; e.g., Califar et al., 2020). Seeded plates were prepared to maintain seed dormancy with a combination of far-red light treatment and light-tight wrapping in DuvetyneTM cloth until insertion into Veggie growth facility on orbit. Dormancy preparation details described in Sng et al. (2014), Fitzgerald et al. (2016), Califar et al. (2020). Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per genotype for each environmental condition (flight and GC) were prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m2s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlaterTM (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, (met1-7, spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflight met1-7 replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven (spaceflight met1-7) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments) plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four biological replicates for each assay. Experiment Operations for Spaceflight and Ground Controls The plates comprising the NASA APEX-04-EPEX experiment was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 to the ISS. NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough (expedition 49/50) managed the experiment from insertion into the Veggie growth hardware to harvest (Figures 1A,B). Images and videos of ISS operations are collected in Supplementary Files 1, 2. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab On orbit operations and comparison of plant growth in both environmental conditions. (A) Astronaut Peggy Whitson inserts seeded plates into the Veggie growth hardware on the ISS. The pinkish lighting is derived from the mixture of red and blue LED growth lights (also Supplementary File 1). (B) Peggy Whitson harvests the 11 day old seedlings to RNAlater-filled KFTs at the MWA on the ISS. (C) Representative examples of each of the three genotypes (Col-0 wild-type, elp2, and met1-7) grown for 11 days in the Veggie hardware in the ISS Environment simulation chamber (ISSES) for the ground controls (top row) and grown for 11 days in Veggie on the ISS for the spaceflight environment (bottom row; also Supplementary File 3).The workflow of the orbital operations was recapitulated for the GCs in the ISSES chamber with a 24 h delay. The delay enabled a precise ground replication of minor changes in daily ISS environmental parameters and crew operations scheduling. Crew operations included the de-stowing of the plates and insertion into Veggie (Figure 1A), daily high-resolution photography of representative plates were taken with a hand-held DSLR camera, and the harvest and fixation of the plates on the final day of growth. Photography and harvests were conducted on the maintenance work area. All plates were photographed before harvest, and representatives of each genotype presented in Figure 1C. The complete set of spaceflight and GC photographs are supplied in the Supplementary File 3. The images were used to assess the growth morphology and general health of the plants. Genomic DNA Isolation and Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Library Preparation DNA extraction was done using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol (LeFrois et al., 2016) and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as that described by Wang et al. (2013), Zhou et al. (2019). Briefly, 700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction. Both the NEBNext® UltraTM II DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-specific methylated and dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–15 cycle amplification using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantified by the RNA concentration was determined on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States), sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were approximately the same size as the RNASeq libraries. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core1. Total RNA Isolation and RNASeq Library Construction RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The RIN numbers of the total RNA used for RNASeq library construction are between 7.1 and 9.3. Basically, 2 μL of 1:200 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half amount of suggested in the ERCC user guide: Cat# 4456740) spike to 1,000 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). This was followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7420) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94°C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the second strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 10 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 48 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core2. HiSeq3000 Procedure, Pooled RNASeq, and MethylSeq Uniquely barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM and pooled (equimolarly) for sequencing on the HiSeq3000 Illumina sequencer. Bisulfite-converted sequencing libraries were sequenced together with RNASeq libraries (uniquely barcoded) to maximize data output. The RNASeq libraries in the pool served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. The final library was created by mixing RNASeq vs bisulfite-converted libraries at a 60:40% ratio, with a mere 1% PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according to the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine. After denaturation, neutralization, and mixing with the ExAmp reagent, the final pool concentration for clustering was 0.25 nM. Sequencing was done using a 2 × 101 cycles format (paired-end configuration). The 48-sample project was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output. MethylSeq Bioinformatics The short reads from the uniquely barcoded bisulfite-converted genomic libraries were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 and quality control on the original and trimmed reads was performed using FastQC v 0.11.4 and MultiQC v 1.1 (Andrews, 2010; Bolger et al., 2014; Ewels et al., 2016). The bisulfite-converted reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using BSMAP (Xi and Li, 2009). Methylation calling was performed with CSCALL and the differential methylation analysis was performed using the MCOMP program, which is part of the MOABS package (Abe et al., 1997; Sun et al., 2014). Cytosine sites with at least a 10x read coverage in at least two out of the four replicates were included in downstream analyses. Methylated cytosine sites for which the p-value of the difference between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01 were considered differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs). In addition, DmCs with a methylation difference > 0 were classified as hypermethylated whereas those < 0 were classified as hypomethylated. DmCs were also categorized based on the characteristics of their genomic locations including the gene body (from transcriptional start site to transcriptional termination site), promoter (2 kb upstream of transcriptional start site), and downstream (2 kb downstream of transcriptional termination site). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined following the method described in Stroud et al. (2013). Briefly, DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within a 100 bp window between spaceflight and GCs, and those with statistical significance (p < 0.01) were used in the analysis. The reads mapped to the chloroplast reference genome were used to calculate the bisulfite conversion efficiency as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019). RNASeq Bioinformatics The overall quality of the RNASeq sequence data was first evaluated using FastQC (Andrews, 2010, 2018). Low-quality bases were trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). STAR Aligner was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Gene expression values were calculated from these alignments using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). The expected read counts and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) were extracted for further analysis. A generalized linear regression model was built to perform the differential gene analysis using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). Prior to the differential expression analysis, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify potential outliers in the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of greater than 2, and the average FPKM for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn (Hulsen et al., 2008). Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core3. Functional Categories Enrichment Arabidopsis thaliana gene IDs from each list of differentially methylated, differentially expressed genes (DmC-DEGs) output from combined methylomic and transcriptomic data were submitted to g:Profiler using the standard parameters (Raudvere et al., 2019). Lists of gene ontology (GO) terms enriched within each group of DmC-DEGs were trimmed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011). Statistical Analyses Original Student’s t-tests were done with Bonferroni corrections. Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication were performed to demonstrate statistical differences in methylation levels between genotypes and plant organ samples.",
    "results": "Results Col-0 and met1-7 Exhibited a Typical Spaceflight Growth Morphology, While elp2-5 Displayed an Unusual Spaceflight Morphology The three genotypes, Col-0, met1-7, and elp2-5 each demonstrated different growth habits in response to spaceflight. Figure 1C shows a representative plate of each genotype grown on the ISS (spaceflight, FT) and comparable GC. Photos of all the harvested plates are presented in Supplementary File 3. Col-0 and met1-7 exhibited a typical growth morphology of Arabidopsis grown in Veggie during spaceflight (Figure 1A). The strong directional growth light gradient in Veggie produces a negative phototropism in roots that results in root growth that largely mimics terrestrial gravitropism (Zhou et al., 2019; Califar et al., 2020). For both Col-0 and met1-7 the spaceflight (FT) roots adopt a slightly randomized growth habit compared to the GCs, yet extend well away from the site of germination and the stem, and are generally negatively phototropic in response to the “vertical” orientation of the plates relative to the light source in the Veggie growth habitat. The Col-0 and met1-7 plants presented healthy visual phenotypes, where their leaves were fully expanded and green. In contrast, elp2-5 plants exhibit spaceflight growth patterns that were distinct from both Col-0 wild-type and met1-7, and did not appear to be responding to the environmental tropic cues directing roots away from the lights in Veggie (Figure 1C). The roots of elp2-5 in spaceflight did not exhibit any directional growth. Instead, all root growth appeared to occur in random patterns that resulted in most of the root mass staying within 1 cm of the germinated seed. The spaceflight leaves of elp2-5 tended to be darker, with more of the plants exhibiting reddish coloration typical of anthocyanin production. Several of the elp2-5 leaves on each of the spaceflight plates were chlorotic. In spite of any morphological differences among the genotypes, all produced the same biomass in spaceflight as on the ground. No statistically supported differences were observed between flight and GCs in either roots or shoots, for all three genotypes (Supplementary Figure 1). Spaceflight Increased Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Levels in met1-7 and elp2-5 but Not in the Wild-Type Col-0 Plants In the GC plant leaves, the methylation level of met1-7 was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in all three methylation contexts. Col-0 and elp2-5 and plants showed similar genome-wide methylation levels (Figures 2A,B). In the GC plant roots, the methylation level of met1-7 was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in the CG and CHG contexts. In the CHH context, there were no statistical differences in methylation among genotypes. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Average genome-wide methylation level profiles in spaceflight and on the ground. (A–D) A comparison of the average genome-wide methylation levels (CG, CHG, and CHH) across the three genotypes is illustrated in leaves grown on the ground (A), roots grown on the ground (B), leaves grown in spaceflight (C), and roots grown in spaceflight (D). Statistical analyses were performed using two-sample t-test with Bonferroni corrections. Bar graphs with different letters show significant differences (p < 0.01). In addition, Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication showed that the relationships between methylation contexts were dependent on the samples (p < 1.0E-10). (E–J) Average genome-wide methylation levels are shown of each genotype (Col-0 wild-type, elp2, and met1-7) and tissue type (leaves or roots) in spaceflight (FT) and ground controls (GC). Data represent the mean of four independent samples and ∗∗ indicate significance (p < 0.01, two-sample t-test with Bonferroni corrections) difference between flight and ground controls in each of the methylation contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH).In spaceflight plants, the methylation levels varied greatly in each genotype, methylation context and tissue type. The flight elp2-5 plants showed a higher methylation level compared to Col-0 in all methylation contexts in both leaves and roots (Figures 2C,D). The flight met1-7 methylation levels were lower than Col-0 in the CG context in both leaves and roots. However, met1-7 showed higher methylation levels than Col-0 in the CHG and CHH contexts in flight leaves while showing similar methylation levels in roots (Figures 2C,D). In Col-0 the average genome-wide methylation levels within each context were not significantly different between flight and GC plants, for either leaves or roots (Figures 2E,F). However, met1-7 and elp2-5 both showed significant increases in methylation levels in spaceflight compared to GCs (Figures 2G–J). The elp2-5 mutants showed significant differences in the average genome-wide methylation levels between spaceflight and GCs in each organ and all methylation contexts (Figures 2G,H). The met1-7 mutants shared similar trends as the elp2-5 mutants in their leaves, however, significant differences between FT and GC were only seen in the CG context of root tissues (Figures 2I,J and Supplementary File 4) includes a detailed breakdown of the distribution of methylation levels, divided into bins ranging from 0 to 100% methylation. Spaceflight Changes in DNA Methylation Levels Were Associated With Protein-Coding Gene Regions Changes in DNA methylation induced by spaceflight associated with protein-coding and flanking genic regions [2 kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS), gene body (gold bar), and 2 kb downstream from transcription termination site] are shown in Figure 3. Pairwise comparison between each methylation mutant and the wild type control are depicted using plot lines color-coded to indicate the environmental conditions [flight, (F) and ground (G)], the genotype [Col-0 (C), elp2-5 (E), and met1-7 (M)] and the tissue type [leaves (L) and roots (R)], as indicated in the upper right legend of each comparison plot. Thus, the pink line in Figure 3A, FCL, reflects the percentage of average methylation for flight, Col-0 leaves across a 4 kb protein-coding region of the genome. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Pairwise comparison of the average methylation levels across protein-coding genes between the genotypes in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. Gene bodies from transcription start site (TSS) to transcription termination site (TTS; highlighted by the yellow bar) as well as the flanking upstream 2 kb and downstream 2 kb are shown. Each pairwise comparison between genotypes and environment is denoted by a three-letter code. The first letter denotes the environment [flight, (F) and ground (G)], the second letter denotes the genotype [Col-0 (C), elp2-5 (E), and met1-7 (M)], and the third letter denotes the specific tissue [leaves (L) and roots (R)]. The y axes indicate the average methylation levels in each of the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. A pairwise comparison between the various genotypes are depicted here Col-0 vs elp2-5 leaves (A) and roots (C), along with Col-0 vs met1-7 leaves (B) and roots (D).The elp2-5 and met1-7 lines differed in their methylation levels across genic regions compared to Col-0. In leaves, Col-0 and elp2-5 showed similar CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels across genic regions associated with protein-coding for both spaceflight and GC environments, as seen by the almost overlapping traces in Figure 3A. However, Col-0 and met1-7 leaves demonstrated notable differences in the CG methylation context. The met1-7 mutants had lower average CG methylation levels compared to Col-0 across all genic regions, with a pronounced difference within the gene body region (gold bar in graph). In spaceflight, met1-7 leaves have a higher methylation level across all genic regions when compared to the GCs (Figure 3B). The elp2-5 roots showed higher spaceflight-associated CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels across all genic regions compared to Col-0 (Figure 3C), but there were differences among the contexts with respect to the methylation levels for the other genotypes. In the CG methylation context, the GC Col-0 roots, GC elp2-5 roots, and flight Col-0 roots all had similar methylation levels, whereas flight elp2-5 roots showed increased methylation. In the CHG and CHH context, flight Col-0 roots had a slightly lower average methylation level across all genic regions when compared to GCs. The met1-7 roots demonstrated noticeable differences in the CG methylation context, with the most pronounced difference within the gene body region (Figure 3D). Flight Col-0 roots had a lower CG methylation level across the gene body regions when compared to the GCs. The flight met1-7 roots had a higher CG methylation level across flanking upstream and downstream genic regions compared to their GCs. In the CHG methylation contexts, there were no obvious differences between Col-0 and met1-7 genotypes in either flight or GCs. In the CHH context, flight Col-0 roots, GC met1-7 roots, and flight met1-7 roots had similar methylation levels, levels that were slightly lower than GC Col-0 roots (Figure 3D). Spaceflight Altered the Distribution and Direction of DmCs in elp2-5 and met1-7 Leaves and Roots The distribution of cytosines differentially methylated by spaceflight within each methylation context in both leaves and roots was assessed for each mutant relative to the wild-type genotype. DmCs were identified as those cytosines with a differential methylation that was statistically significant to p < 0.01 in each comparison and context (Figure 4). The percentage of DmCs was also mapped to different genomic regions for each methylation context. The percentage maps of Upstream (2 kb upstream of the TSS), UTRs, Exons, Introns, Downstream (2 kb downstream of the polyadenylation site), transposable element, Intergenic, and Pseudogenes are shown for each genotype in the flight vs ground comparisons of leaves and roots (Supplementary Figure 3). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs) of leaves and roots from each genotype in response to spaceflight. (A) Breakdown of each methylation context for DmCs in leaves and roots of Col-0, elp2, and met1-7 in spaceflight compared to ground control. (B) Total number of DmCs broken down in each context for all three genotypes in leaves and roots. (C) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total leaf DmCs in each context – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black. (D) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total root DmCs in each context.In spaceflight, the percentage of DmCs of elp2-5 relative to Col-0 in leaves is highest in the CHH context (53%; Figure 4A), whereas in the GCs the percentage was highest in the CG context (47%). Similarly, spaceflight roots (Figure 4B) had a higher percentage of DmCs in the CHH context (60%), while in GC roots the majority of the DmCs were divided about equally between CHH (42%) and CG (43%) contexts. In all cases, the percentages of DmCs in the CHG context in the elp2-5 plants changed very little among organs and environments (15–18%). Most of the elp2-5 DmCs were hypermethylated (Figures 4A,B). In the met1-7 and Col-0 comparison, the majority of the DmCs were in the CG context in both leaves and roots, and both organs had lower percentages of CG DmCs in FT than in GC (Figures 4C,D). In leaves, this decrease in the percentage of CG DmCs in FT compared to GC was larger in leaves (13%) compared to roots (3%). In addition, there was a 10% increase in the percentage of CHH DmCs in FT (29%) compared to GC (19%) in the leaves (Figure 4C). In roots, there was only a 1% increase in FT compared to GC (Figure 4D). As was seen in the elp2-5 plants, the percentage of CHG DmCs changed very little among organs and environments (10–13%). Most of the met1-7 DmCs were hypomethylated (Figures 4C,D). The distribution of gene-related DmCs in response to spaceflight was genotype- and organ-specific (Figure 5). In Col-0 leaves, DmCs were primarily hypomethylated. In the upstream and downstream flanking regions, the CHH context predominated, but within the gene body the CHH and CG contexts were about equally represented, and CGH methylation the least represented (Figure 5A). In contrast, in both elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves the DmCs were primarily hypermethylated (Figures 5B,C). In elp2-5 leaves methylation in the CHH context predominated in loci within all genic regions (Figure 5B). In met1-7 leaves the CG and CHH contexts were about equally represented in all genic regions (Figure 5C). In Col-0 roots, DmCs were again primarily hypomethylated, but unlike in leaves, the CHH context predominated within all genic regions (Figure 5D). As with leaves, the DmCs in both elp2-5 and met1-7 roots were predominantly hypermethylated (Figures 5E,F). In elp2-5 roots, methylation of DmCs in the CHH context again predominated in loci within all genic regions, and loci with CG and CHG methylation were about equally distributed in each genic region (Figure 5E). In met1-7 roots, DmCs with methylation in the CHH contexts were slightly more abundant across all genic regions, but methylation in all contexts was higher in the downstream genic region (Figure 5F). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Methylation context breakdown of DmCs mapped to different genic features in spaceflight vs ground comparisons. Leaf and Root DMCs of Col-0 (A,D) elp2-5 (B,E), and met1-7 (C,F) in response to spaceflight are mapped to genic features such as; upstream (2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site), gene body (exons, introns, and both 5′ and 3′ UTRs), and downstream (2,000 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site). The corresponding methylation direction in each context is also illustrated – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black.Each genotype displayed distinct, organ-specific distributions of DMRs between spaceflight and the GCs (Figure 6). DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within 100 bp windows between FT and GC, and regions with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) were used in the analysis. In the Col-0 spaceflight response, 659 DMRs were detected in leaves, and 765 DMRs in roots. In both Col-0 tissues, an average of 51% of the DMRs were found within the CHH context, whereas the other half of the DMR were evenly distributed between the CHG and CG contexts at 24.5% each. In elp2-5, there were 717 DMRs in leaves and 2,974 DMRs in roots (Figure 6A). In both elp2-5 tissues, an average of 63% of the DMRs were found in the CHH context, which was 12% more than Col-0. DMRs in the CHG context were distributed similarly to that of Col-0 at an average of 25%, however, DMRs in the CG context were at an average of 12.5% which was about half that of Col-0. In met1-7, there were 6,114 DMRs in leaves and 3,745 DMRs in roots. The majority of the DMRs in both tissues were in the CG context at an average of 83%. DMRs in the CHG context in both tissues were at an average of 8.5% whereas DMRs in the CHH context averaged 12% in the leaves and 5% in the roots (Figure 6A). FIGURE 6.

(A) Breakdown of each methylation context for DMRs in leaves and roots of Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7 in spaceflight compared to ground control. (B) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total leaf/root DMRs in each genotype in response to spaceflight – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black. (C) Distribution of leaf and root gene-related DMRs of Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7 in response to spaceflight. DMRs are mapped to genic features such as; upstream (2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site), gene body (exons, introns, and both 5′ and 3′ UTRs), and downstream (2,000 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site). The corresponding methylation direction in each context is also illustrated – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black.The spaceflight-associated DMRs in Col-0 were distributed between hypo and hypermethylation, while hypomethylated DMRs predominated in the mutants. In Col-0 leaves, 39% of the DMRs were hypomethylated and 61% hypermethylated, whereas in Col-0 roots, 67% of the DMRs were hypomethylated and 33% were hypermethylated. However, in both elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves and roots, DMRs were predominantly hypermethylated ranging from 97 to 99% (Figure 6B). Gene-related DMRs (Figure 6C) reflected organ-specific responses to spaceflight in all genotypes, but the largest difference in the number of DMR loci between leaves and roots was in elp2-5. In Col-0 leaves and roots, the number of DMRs in all genic regions and context was less than 400, with the highest number of DMRs found within the CHH context. In gene-related DMRs in Col-0 leaves hypo- and hypermethylation were fairly evenly distributed across all contexts, whereas in Col-0 roots, gene-related DMRs were mostly hypomethylated (70%). In Col-0 leaves and roots, gene-related DMRs were most abundant in the gene body region. In contrast to wild-type Col-0, the total gene-related DMRs in elp2-5 were substantially higher in the roots compared to the leaves. In elp2-5 roots, DMRs were primarily in the CHH context and were predominantly hypermethylated in all genic regions. The highest number of DMRs in the elp2-5 roots were within the gene body region. In met1-7, DMRs were found at a higher number in the leaves compared to the roots. DMRs in both leaves and roots were predominantly hypermethylated and were distributed primarily in the CG context. In met1-7 leaves, the highest number of DMRs were located upstream of the TSS (Figure 6C). Spaceflight Affected More Genes in the Roots of elp2-5, and More Genes in the Leaves of met1-7 Spaceflight associated differential gene expression was genotype- and organ-specific; in elp2-5 more genes were affected in roots, while in met1-7 more genes were affected in leaves (Figure 7). Transcripts showing at least a twofold change (−1 ≤ log2 FC ≥ 1) with an FDR value of < 0.05 were identified as DEGs. PCAs of each type of tissue were performed individually, as leaves and roots have widely different patterns of gene expression (Paul et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2019). The PCA plots of leaves and roots showed different grouping of elp2-5 samples along with the components compared to Col-0 and met1-7 (Supplementary File 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). In the comparison of spaceflight to ground leaves, Col-0 had a total of 207 (123 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated) DEGs, elp2-5 had 36 (26 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) DEGs, and met1-7 had 226 (160 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated) DEGs (Figure 7A). In roots, a total of 147 (28 up-regulated and 119 down-regulated), 120 (50 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated), and 47 (39 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated) DEGs were found in Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7, respectively (Figure 7B). Only a few DEGs overlapped between the genotypes in both leaf and root tissues (Figures 7C,D). In leaves, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and met1-7, whereas, in roots, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and elp2-5 (Figures 7C,D). The patterns of DEGs in all three genotypes were distinctly organ-specific, and of the 436 DEGs in leaves and 288 in roots, only 35 DEGs were common to both sets (Figure 7E). Although there were overall fewer root-specific DEGs, a greater proportion of the root DEGs were also differentially methylated in response to spaceflight compared to the DEGs of leaves. In roots, 82% of the DEGs also exhibited DmCs, whereas in leaves, 31% of the DEGs also mapped to DmCs (Figure 7F and Supplementary File 5). FIGURE 7.

(F) Bar graph showing the percentage of DmCs that mapped to DEGs in leaves (gray bar) and in roots (black bars).The composition of DmC-DEGs in elp2-5 compared to Col-0 was distinctive in each environmental and organ comparison (Figure 8). In leaves, elp2-5 vs Col-0 on the ground had a total of 2,119 DEGs (1,322 up-regulated and 797 down-regulated) whereas in spaceflight there were a total of 2,149 DEGs (1,448 up-regulated and 701 down-regulated; Figure 8A). Of these, 996 DEGs were also differentially methylated in the GCs, and a total of 1,188 DmC-DEGs were observed in spaceflight (Figure 8B). A total of 497 DmCs-DEGs were shared between both environmental conditions. In roots, the pairwise comparison of elp2-5 and Col-0 revealed a total of 1,667 (725 up-regulated and 942 down-regulated) DEGs on the ground and 1,626 (724 up-regulated and 902 down-regulated) DEGs in spaceflight (Figure 8C). Of these, 1,222 DEGs on the ground were also associated with DmCs and 1,481 DEGs in spaceflight were associated with DmCs. Among these, 723 DmC-DEGs were shared in both spaceflight and GC conditions (Figure 8D). A visual heat-map summary of the organ-specific distribution of DEGs and the DmC-DEGs for all genotypes is presented in the Supplementary Figure 2, which is annotated in Supplementary File 6.

(E) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of DmC-DEG genes in elp2-5 vs Col-0 comparison of both leaves and roots in each environment (GC and FT). The heatmap shows the GO terms that were enriched within each environment and tissue combination between elp2-5 and Col-0. The scale bar represents the negative Log10 of the q-values (corrected p-values) from the “test of significance of enrichment” within each list of DmC-DEGs. The q-value cutoff was set at 0.05. Higher values in the scaling indicate higher significance of the enrichment.Multiple metabolic processes appeared to be altered in elp2-5 compared to Col-0 (Figure 8E). GO analysis of the DmC-DEGs of elp2-5 compared to Col-0 showed that elp2-5 was engaged with many processes characteristic of stress responses (Figure 8E). Processes shared as enriched between leaf and root DmC-DEGs included general responses to stimuli, oxidoreductase activities, and heme-binding. Leaf-specific DmC-DEGs were enriched in biosynthetic processes of flavonoids and pigments, jasmonic acid, and wounding responses in both GC and FT. DmC-DEGs in GC leaves were more specifically enriched in phenylpropanoid metabolism and the response to oxidative stress, as well as in further oxidoreducatase and peroxidase activities. DmC-DEGs in FT leaves were enriched with defense and hypoxia responses. DmC-DEGs annotated to the plasma membrane and extracellular structures were enriched among both GC and FT roots, in addition to transport processes and activities. Carbohydrate transport and binding were specifically enriched among root GC DmC-DEGs. Thus, elp2-5 shows differential expression and methylation of stress and hormone response pathways, as well as transport and metabolic pathways, when compared to the Col-0 wild-type line within each tissue and growth condition. Relative to the Col-0 response, there were substantially more DEGs and DmCs in elp2-5 (Figure 8) than were seen in met1-7 (Figure 9). In leaves, elp2-5 vs Col-0 showed a total of 2,119 (1,322 up-regulated and 797 down-regulated) DEGs in GC, whereas 2,149 (1,448 up-regulated and 701 down-regulated) DEGs were observed in FT (Figure 8A). DmC-DEGs in the elp2-5 to Col-0 leaves comparison revealed 996 differentially methylated and expressed transcripts on the GC and 1,188 in FT, of which 499 were unique to GC, 691 unique to FT, and 497 were shared among both conditions (Figure 8B). In the roots, the pairwise comparison of elp2-5 and Col-0 in the GC revealed a total of 1,667 (725 up-regulated and 942 down-regulated) DEGs and a total of 1,626 (724 up-regulated and 902 down-regulated) DEGs in FT (Figure 8C). DmC-DEGs in the elp2-5 to Col-0 roots comparison revealed a total of 1,222 DmC-DEGs in GC roots and 1,481 DmC-DEGs in FT roots, of which 723 were shared in both conditions (Figure 8D). In leaves, met1-7 vs Col-0 showed a total of 840 (355 up-regulated and 485 down-regulated) DEGs in GC, whereas in FT 637 (375 up-regulated and 262 down-regulated) DEGs were observed (Figure 9A). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to Col-0 leaves comparison revealed 527 differentially methylated and expressed transcripts on the ground and 408 in flight, of which 261 were unique to GC, 142 unique to FT, and 266 were shared among both conditions (Figure 9B). In the roots, the pairwise comparison of met1-7 and Col-0 in the GC revealed a total of 779 (343 up-regulated and 436 down-regulated) DEGs and a total of 593 (369 up-regulated and 224 down-regulated) DEGs in spaceflight (Figure 9C). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to Col-0 roots comparison revealed a total of 648 DmC-DEGs in GC roots and 430 DmC-DEGs in FT roots, of which 313 were shared in both conditions (Figure 9D). FIGURE 9.

The scale bar represents the negative Log10 of the q-values (corrected p-values) from the “test of significance of enrichment” within each list of DmC-DEGs. The q-value cutoff was set at 0.05. Higher values in the scaling indicate higher significance of the enrichment.Gene ontology analysis of DmC-DEGs between met1-7 and the wild-type line yielded few term enrichments (Figure 8E). Biological process enrichments associated with hypoxic responses and biosynthesis of anthocyanin-containing compounds were present in GC root DmC-DEGs. Molecular functions of ADP binding, sesquiterpene compound synthase activities, and cell wall constituents, and nutrient reservoir activity were enriched in leaf GC DmC-DEGs, leaf FT DmC-DEGs, and root GC DmC-DEGs, respectively. Alignments of DmC-DEGs in each methylation context in the various genic regions were generated for each genotype and depicted as heatmaps (Figure 10). In leaves, a total of 59 DmC-DEGs were observed in wild-type Col-0, while in elp2-5 and met1-7, there were 11 and 72 DmC-DEGs, respectively. Correlations between differential expression and DNA methylation were used to organize the heatmap. The top bracketed sections of the heatmaps show negative correlations where up-regulated genes aligned with hypomethylated DmCs and down-regulated genes aligned with hypermethylated DmCs are grouped. The following bracketed section shows positive correlations where the converse relationship between DEGs and DmCs was highlighted. The unbracketed section at the bottom of the heatmap shows genes that have no distinguishable correlations between DEGs and DmCs. In Col-0 leaves, 41% (24 out of 59) of genes had a negative correlation and 49% (29 out of 59) had a positive correlation. In elp2-5 leaves, negative and positive correlation were evenly distributed at 45% (5 out of 11), whereas in met1-7 leaves, 26% (19 out of 72) of genes showed a negative correlation and 60% (43 out of 72) had a positive correlation. In roots, there were a total of 114 DmC-DEGs in Col-0, 101 DmC-DEGs in elp2-5, and 28 DmC-DEGs in met1-7 (Figure 11). 16% (19 out of 114) of the wild-type Col-0 root DmC-DEGs had a negative correlation between gene expression and methylation levels, whereas 66% (75 out of 114) were positively correlated. In elp2-5 roots, 54% (55 out of 101) of genes showed a negative correlation, and 42% (42 out of 101) showed a positive correlation. In met1-7 roots, 36% (10 out of 28) of genes showed a negative correlation, and 50% (14 out of 28) showed a positive correlation. FIGURE 10.

In Col-0 leaves, DmC-DEGs were enriched in localization to glyoxosomes (Figure 12A). The DmC-DEGs observed in the spaceflight response of met1-7 leaves were in pathways associated with the metabolism of pigments containing anthocyanins. The enrichments among the Col-0 root FT vs GC DmC-DEGs were primarily associated with defense pathways and responses to hypoxia, as well as the cell wall and membrane nanodomains (Figure 12B and Supplementary Table 1). Col-0 and elp2-5 roots showed enrichments of molecular function GO terms, involving FAD and manganese ion binding, and carbonate dehydratase activity, respectively. A secondary analysis using all FT vs GC DEGs showed that the analysis of only DmC-DEGs recapitulated the majority of the terms associated with the overall transcriptomic response to spaceflight (data not shown). The GO-associated processes, localizations, and functions represented by these terms are gained or lost from the methylation-sensitive aspect of the spaceflight response dependent on the functionality of ELP2 and MET1.

    "discussion": "Discussion DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses and physiological adaptation in plants (Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010; Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Garg et al., 2015; Tameshige et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019). Physiological adaptation to spaceflight engages gene expression changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses (Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Blancaflor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014; Nakashima et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Barker et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019; Kruse et al., 2020; Supplementary Table 2). In addition, the first whole-genome survey of DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown entirely in the spaceflight environment showed correlated changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs in spaceflight, especially in stress response genes such as those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). However, such correlations do not establish a functional connection between DNA methylation and physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation, were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type. The assays for response to spaceflight were overall growth and morphology, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles. The elp2-5 plants failed to grow normally in spaceflight (Figure 1A). Previous experiments have shown that in the microgravity of spaceflight, plant root growth is altered compared to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional light, roots generally grow away from the light source and establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally healthy-looking morphology (Paul et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2019). However, the roots of the elp2-5 plants in spaceflight did not set up this typical spaceflight directionality, as the roots did not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass of the elp2-5 plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, all of the biomass of the elp2-5 spaceflight plants was concentrated into the area very near the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is also apparent in the elp2-5 spaceflight transcriptome. The leaves of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants appeared to be less expanded, more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than the leaves of the GCs (Figure 1C). The elp2-5 mutants generally exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can be further exacerbated by stress (Zhou et al., 2009). This distinct, spaceflight-dependent, morphology for elp2-5 plants suggests that elp2-5 plants are physiologically maladapted to spaceflight. While it has been established that ELP2 has a role in root development (e.g., Jia et al., 2015) the spaceflight data suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in gravity perception and root navigation. In terrestrial environments, where gravity can impart a tropic force, plants lacking ELP2 have shorter roots but grow reasonably well (Jia et al., 2015). However, in the absence of gravity, elp2-5 mutant roots appear to lose the ability to navigate effectively away from the site of the germinating seed. The met1-7 plants appeared better able to cope with the absence of gravity than elp2-5 plants, as their spaceflight root growth patterns were similar to Col-0, with no obvious deleterious morphologies seen on orbit (Figure 1C). The met1-7 plants produced as much biomass on orbit as in the GCs (Supplementary Figure 1) and established a root growth pattern that was visually typical of spaceflight growth (Paul et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2019) and similar to the appearance of Col-0 (Figure 1C). The differential spaceflight morphologies of elp2-5 and met1-7 suggest that the DNA methylation events conditioned by MET1 and ELP2 differentially affect spaceflight physiological adaptation and success. Since MET1 and ELP2 represent two different mechanisms that affect methylation, these results suggest that spaceflight might affect the methylation of specific genes more than the genome-wide status of methylation. The degree of genome-wide methylation was not statistically different between spaceflight and GCs for Col-0, but both elp2-5 and met1-7 were generally hypermethylated compared to the GCs (Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1). This result reinforces the conclusion that changes in overall average genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild-type plants, as this result was also seen in the spaceflight methylome of Arabidopsis cultivar WS (Zhou et al., 2019). However, the hypermethylation of the mutant genomes suggested that the respective contributions of MET1 and ELP2 are important to maintaining an appropriate degree of genome-wide methylation in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The degree of DNA methylation within each context in elp2-5 was significantly increased in response to spaceflight in both leaves and roots (Figures 2G,H) compared to the degree of methylation of these mutants with respect to wild type in the GCs. However, there was a distinction between the two mutant lines in the degree and context of methylation in the respective root genomes. The spaceflight elp2-5 root genome was significantly hypermethylated in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) compared to the GCs, whereas only CG methylation was elevated in the spaceflight met1-7 genome (Figures 2D,H,J). Although the contribution of CHG and CHH methylation in Arabidopsis is generally small (about 14%; Niederhuth et al., 2016) it is possible that while genome-wide changes in CG methylation does not impact spaceflight root growth morphology, changes in the CHG and CHH context may contribute to the spaceflight phenotype of elp2-5 plants. The degree of spaceflight methylation across protein-coding regions showed organ-specificity among all genotypes. Methylation in the protein coding regions is relevant to gene expression profiles, which are also highly organ specific. Spaceflight induced more CG methylation across all protein-coding regions (upstream, gene body, and downstream) in met1-7 leaves and only increased methylation in the upstream and downstream regions in roots (Figure 3). Conversely, elp2-5 methylation was increased across all protein-coding regions and methylation contexts only in the roots in response to spaceflight (Figure 3). The substantial increase in CHH methylation in elp2-5 roots (Figures 4A,B) suggests that ELP2 plays a dominant role in governing the spaceflight-associated methylation changes in the roots, specifically in the CHH context. This correlates with the root growth morphology exhibited by elp2-5. Col-0, met1-7, and elp2-5 are each different in their spaceflight gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. The profiles of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes in both elp2-5 and met1-7 were unique compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figures 10, 11 and Supplementary Figure 2). The loss of MET1 and ELP2 each had a substantial influence on the profiles of DEGs and differentially methylated genes in response to the spaceflight environment. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the elp2-5 spaceflight plants indicate that the spaceflight plants are under considerable stress compared to GCs. Almost a third of the genes uniquely induced in the spaceflight elp2-5 leaves are associated with nutrient stress, and most of the rest are genes associated with heat stress, ROS and pathogen responses. These gene classes were also noticeably represented among the elp2-5 spaceflight root DEGs. These gene expression patterns describe a highly stressed response reflecting the compact growth morphology of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the met1-7 spaceflight plants suggest that met1-7 plants were better adjusted to spaceflight than the elp2-5 plants. As with the elp2-5 plants, the met1-7 plants present a number of stress-associated DEGs. However, in contrast to the types of genes expressed by spaceflight elp2-5 plants, the DEGs in spaceflight met1-7 plants predominantly functioned in signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 6). While organ-specific differences in the gene expression patterns of various Arabidopsis tissue types (leaves, hypocotyls, roots, and root tips) have been previously reported in spaceflight transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), the met1-7 and elp2-5 plant lines each demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. A large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) and met1-7 (72 out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of differentially methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out of 147) and elp2-5 (101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes, suggesting that unique organ-specific mechanisms were engaged for spaceflight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots, in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression in spaceflight were complex and differed between leaves and roots. In wild-type Col-0 leaves, the hypomethylated DmCs and hypermethylated DmCs were evenly distributed across all contexts and all genic regions (Figure 5A). The association of changes in methylation with gene expression showed an even proportion of positive and negative correlation. In met1-7 leaves, DmCs were predominantly hypermethylated in the CG and CHH contexts of downstream regions, and a larger proportion of positive correlations were observed among DmC-DEGs (Figure 10). In elp2-5 roots, DmCs were primarily hypermethylated in the CHH context across all genic regions, yet a larger proportion of DmC-DEGs showed a negative correlation (Figure 11). These observations are in contrast with other studies that report a strong negative correlation between promoter CG methylation and gene expression levels (Finnegan et al., 1996; Garg et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2015). Further investigations may clarify the relationship between leaf spaceflight transcript abundance and methylation in different contexts and genic regions. However, 80% of DEGs (across all genotypes) were also differentially methylated in roots. In leaves, that average was only 30% (Figure 7F). These data suggest that DNA methylation plays a significantly larger role in regulating the genes associated with the spaceflight response in roots than in leaves. The genes differentially regulated by elp2-5 and met1-7 in spaceflight were from distinctly different metabolic processes than those regulated in Col-0 in response to spaceflight. Functional analyses of DmC-DEGs showed sharp contrasts among elp2-5 and met1-7 with the Col-0 wild-type. The mutant elp2-5 line showed differential methylation and expression of gene classes traditionally associated with the spaceflight response and other abiotic stresses, such as metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses across tissue types (Figure 8E; Cramer et al., 2011). The mutant met1-7 line, conversely, demonstrated relatively few GO term enrichments, indicating that DmC-DEGs tended to result from largely untargeted changes in methylation (Figure 9E). ELP2 regulates root growth and development, and elp2 loss of function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype may be linked to the root-specific involvement of DmC-DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and extracellular localization observed in this study (Figures 1C, 8E; Jia et al., 2015). The spaceflight-associated processes that are differentially represented in elp2-5 are also among the primary classes enriched in DmC-DEGs involved in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0 (Figures 8E, 12). These data suggest that the spaceflight response works more directly through DNA methylation mechanisms and other mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through the maintenance mechanisms represented by MET1. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). The response to spaceflight includes differential DNA methylation in a manner that is similar to known terrestrial stress responses, particularly those associated with pathogen attack or harsh environments. Supplementary Table 2 provides a comparison of these spaceflight-associated DmC-DEGs with those from several terrestrial studies of environmental stress responses (Yong-Villalobos et al., 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017, 2018; Stassen et al., 2018; Korotko et al., 2021). This correlation strongly suggests that the spaceflight response, though novel, utilizes a range of mechanistic approaches that are typically employed during terrestrial environmental stress. While direct methylation mechanisms represented by MET1 certainly affect the spaceflight response in terms of gene expression profiles, the indirect DNA demethylation/methylation mechanisms associated with ELP2 have a more profound role than MET1 in the spaceflight response.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants.",

Copyright notice ID: 8475764 PMID: 34589093 Abstract Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5. Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response. Keywords: spaceflight adaptation, DNA methylation, epigenetic, space biology, microgravity, elongator complex subunit 2, methyltransferase 1, methylation mutantsIntroduction Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g., Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010; Sewelam et al., 2014; Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g., Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2018). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g., Labra et al., 2002; Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010; Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011; Bilichak et al., 2012; Colaneri and Jones, 2013; Tricker et al., 2013; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015, 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017, 2018; Bartels et al., 2018; Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018; Beyrne et al., 2019; Ashapkin et al., 2020; Akhter et al., 2021; Korotko et al., 2021; Laanen et al., 2021; Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling (Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Blancaflor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014; Nakashima et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Ferl and Paul, 2016; Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020; Califar et al., 2020; Kruse et al., 2020; Angelos et al., 2021; Manian et al., 2021b). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (Xu et al., 2018). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs; Zhou et al., 2019). The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs; Zhou et al., 2019). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments (Huang et al., 2019). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response (Dowen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Tameshige et al., 2015; Jarosz et al., 2020). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight (Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Herranz et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020; Califar et al., 2020; Manian et al., 2021a). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight? DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context (Chevalier et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2012; Pikaard, 2013). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct de novo DNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V (Matzke et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts (Zhong et al., 2014). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases. The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites (Kankel et al., 2003; Rigal et al., 2016). MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses (Naydenov et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015; Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020). The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes (Saze et al., 2003). Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections (Kankel et al., 2003; Dowen et al., 2012). Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutant met1-3 lines (Supplementary Material, Dowen et al., 2012) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019) including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis (Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1. The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Nelissen et al., 2005; Glatt and Muller, 2013; Ding and Mou, 2015; Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function (Ding and Mou, 2015) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g., Glatt and Muller, 2013; Jarosz et al., 2020). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response (Woloszynska et al., 2016). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g., Xie and Yu, 2015), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in: Jarosz et al., 2020). ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., Wang et al., 2013) and plays a role in root development (e.g., Jia et al., 2015), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation (DeFraia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription (DeFraia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development (Jia et al., 2015) and auxin signaling (Nelissen et al., 2010). Many of the genes differentially expressed between elp2 mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses (Zhou et al., 2009). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed in elp2 mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g., Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants. The Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EPEX) spaceflight experiment reported herein investigated the contribution of epigenomic changes in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, specifically the role of cytosine DNA methylation in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis. The experiment was conducted onboard the ISS to evaluate the spaceflight responses of the methylation mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 compared to the Col-0 wild-type background of both mutant lines. Growth patterns, genome-wide methylation profiles, and differential gene expression profiles were used to develop an integrated assessment of the interplay of DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation in the response to spaceflight.Materials and Methods Plant Material and Experimental Design Three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) were used: Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type (TAIR CS70000), and Col-0 mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 genotype. Mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 previously described in Kanno et al. (2008), Guo et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2013), and were kindly provided by Dr. Zhonglin Mou (Wang et al., 2013). Sterilized seeds from each line were sown aseptically onto Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5 × Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, and then sealed with breathable tape (3M Micropore®, Maplewood, MN, United States; e.g., Califar et al., 2020). Seeded plates were prepared to maintain seed dormancy with a combination of far-red light treatment and light-tight wrapping in DuvetyneTM cloth until insertion into Veggie growth facility on orbit. Dormancy preparation details described in Sng et al. (2014), Fitzgerald et al. (2016), Califar et al. (2020). Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per genotype for each environmental condition (flight and GC) were prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m2s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlaterTM (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, (met1-7, spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflight met1-7 replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven (spaceflight met1-7) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments) plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four biological replicates for each assay.Experiment Operations for Spaceflight and Ground Controls The plates comprising the NASA APEX-04-EPEX experiment was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 to the ISS. NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough (expedition 49/50) managed the experiment from insertion into the Veggie growth hardware to harvest (Figures 1A,B). Images and videos of ISS operations are collected in Supplementary Files 1, 2. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab On orbit operations and comparison of plant growth in both environmental conditions.

The delay enabled a precise ground replication of minor changes in daily ISS environmental parameters and crew operations scheduling. Crew operations included the de-stowing of the plates and insertion into Veggie (Figure 1A), daily high-resolution photography of representative plates were taken with a hand-held DSLR camera, and the harvest and fixation of the plates on the final day of growth. Photography and harvests were conducted on the maintenance work area. All plates were photographed before harvest, and representatives of each genotype presented in Figure 1C. The complete set of spaceflight and GC photographs are supplied in the Supplementary File 3. The images were used to assess the growth morphology and general health of the plants.Genomic DNA Isolation and Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Library Preparation DNA extraction was done using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol (LeFrois et al., 2016) and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as that described by Wang et al. (2013), Zhou et al. (2019). Briefly, 700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction. Both the NEBNext® UltraTM II DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-specific methylated and dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–15 cycle amplification using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantified by the RNA concentration was determined on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States), sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were approximately the same size as the RNASeq libraries. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core1.Total RNA Isolation and RNASeq Library Construction RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The RIN numbers of the total RNA used for RNASeq library construction are between 7.1 and 9.3. Basically, 2 μL of 1:200 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half amount of suggested in the ERCC user guide: Cat# 4456740) spike to 1,000 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). This was followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7420) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94°C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the second strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 10 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 48 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core2.HiSeq3000 Procedure, Pooled RNASeq, and MethylSeq Uniquely barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM and pooled (equimolarly) for sequencing on the HiSeq3000 Illumina sequencer. Bisulfite-converted sequencing libraries were sequenced together with RNASeq libraries (uniquely barcoded) to maximize data output. The RNASeq libraries in the pool served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. The final library was created by mixing RNASeq vs bisulfite-converted libraries at a 60:40% ratio, with a mere 1% PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according to the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine. After denaturation, neutralization, and mixing with the ExAmp reagent, the final pool concentration for clustering was 0.25 nM. Sequencing was done using a 2 × 101 cycles format (paired-end configuration). The 48-sample project was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output.MethylSeq Bioinformatics The short reads from the uniquely barcoded bisulfite-converted genomic libraries were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 and quality control on the original and trimmed reads was performed using FastQC v 0.11.4 and MultiQC v 1.1 (Andrews, 2010; Bolger et al., 2014; Ewels et al., 2016). The bisulfite-converted reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using BSMAP (Xi and Li, 2009). Methylation calling was performed with CSCALL and the differential methylation analysis was performed using the MCOMP program, which is part of the MOABS package (Abe et al., 1997; Sun et al., 2014). Cytosine sites with at least a 10x read coverage in at least two out of the four replicates were included in downstream analyses. Methylated cytosine sites for which the p-value of the difference between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01 were considered differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs). In addition, DmCs with a methylation difference > 0 were classified as hypermethylated whereas those < 0 were classified as hypomethylated. DmCs were also categorized based on the characteristics of their genomic locations including the gene body (from transcriptional start site to transcriptional termination site), promoter (2 kb upstream of transcriptional start site), and downstream (2 kb downstream of transcriptional termination site). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined following the method described in Stroud et al. (2013). Briefly, DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within a 100 bp window between spaceflight and GCs, and those with statistical significance (p < 0.01) were used in the analysis. The reads mapped to the chloroplast reference genome were used to calculate the bisulfite conversion efficiency as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019).RNASeq Bioinformatics The overall quality of the RNASeq sequence data was first evaluated using FastQC (Andrews, 2010, 2018). Low-quality bases were trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). STAR Aligner was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Gene expression values were calculated from these alignments using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). The expected read counts and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) were extracted for further analysis. A generalized linear regression model was built to perform the differential gene analysis using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). Prior to the differential expression analysis, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify potential outliers in the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of greater than 2, and the average FPKM for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn (Hulsen et al., 2008). Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core3.Functional Categories Enrichment Arabidopsis thaliana gene IDs from each list of differentially methylated, differentially expressed genes (DmC-DEGs) output from combined methylomic and transcriptomic data were submitted to g:Profiler using the standard parameters (Raudvere et al., 2019). Lists of gene ontology (GO) terms enriched within each group of DmC-DEGs were trimmed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011).Statistical Analyses Original Student’s t-tests were done with Bonferroni corrections. Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication were performed to demonstrate statistical differences in methylation levels between genotypes and plant organ samples.Results Col-0 and met1-7 Exhibited a Typical Spaceflight Growth Morphology, While elp2-5 Displayed an Unusual Spaceflight Morphology The three genotypes, Col-0, met1-7, and elp2-5 each demonstrated different growth habits in response to spaceflight. Figure 1C shows a representative plate of each genotype grown on the ISS (spaceflight, FT) and comparable GC. Photos of all the harvested plates are presented in Supplementary File 3. Col-0 and met1-7 exhibited a typical growth morphology of Arabidopsis grown in Veggie during spaceflight (Figure 1A). The strong directional growth light gradient in Veggie produces a negative phototropism in roots that results in root growth that largely mimics terrestrial gravitropism (Zhou et al., 2019; Califar et al., 2020). For both Col-0 and met1-7 the spaceflight (FT) roots adopt a slightly randomized growth habit compared to the GCs, yet extend well away from the site of germination and the stem, and are generally negatively phototropic in response to the “vertical” orientation of the plates relative to the light source in the Veggie growth habitat. The Col-0 and met1-7 plants presented healthy visual phenotypes, where their leaves were fully expanded and green. In contrast, elp2-5 plants exhibit spaceflight growth patterns that were distinct from both Col-0 wild-type and met1-7, and did not appear to be responding to the environmental tropic cues directing roots away from the lights in Veggie (Figure 1C). The roots of elp2-5 in spaceflight did not exhibit any directional growth. Instead, all root growth appeared to occur in random patterns that resulted in most of the root mass staying within 1 cm of the germinated seed. The spaceflight leaves of elp2-5 tended to be darker, with more of the plants exhibiting reddish coloration typical of anthocyanin production. Several of the elp2-5 leaves on each of the spaceflight plates were chlorotic. In spite of any morphological differences among the genotypes, all produced the same biomass in spaceflight as on the ground. No statistically supported differences were observed between flight and GCs in either roots or shoots, for all three genotypes (Supplementary Figure 1).Spaceflight Increased Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Levels in met1-7 and elp2-5 but Not in the Wild-Type Col-0 Plants In the GC plant leaves, the methylation level of met1-7 was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in all three methylation contexts. Col-0 and elp2-5 and plants showed similar genome-wide methylation levels (Figures 2A,B). In the GC plant roots, the methylation level of met1-7 was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in the CG and CHG contexts. In the CHH context, there were no statistical differences in methylation among genotypes. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Average genome-wide methylation level profiles in spaceflight and on the ground. (A–D) A comparison of the average genome-wide methylation levels (CG, CHG, and CHH) across the three genotypes is illustrated in leaves grown on the ground (A), roots grown on the ground (B), leaves grown in spaceflight (C), and roots grown in spaceflight (D). Statistical analyses were performed using two-sample t-test with Bonferroni corrections. Bar graphs with different letters show significant differences (p < 0.01). In addition, Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication showed that the relationships between methylation contexts were dependent on the samples (p < 1.0E-10). (E–J) Average genome-wide methylation levels are shown of each genotype (Col-0 wild-type, elp2, and met1-7) and tissue type (leaves or roots) in spaceflight (FT) and ground controls (GC). Data represent the mean of four independent samples and ∗∗ indicate significance (p < 0.01, two-sample t-test with Bonferroni corrections) difference between flight and ground controls in each of the methylation contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH).In spaceflight plants, the methylation levels varied greatly in each genotype, methylation context and tissue type. The flight elp2-5 plants showed a higher methylation level compared to Col-0 in all methylation contexts in both leaves and roots (Figures 2C,D). The flight met1-7 methylation levels were lower than Col-0 in the CG context in both leaves and roots. However, met1-7 showed higher methylation levels than Col-0 in the CHG and CHH contexts in flight leaves while showing similar methylation levels in roots (Figures 2C,D). In Col-0 the average genome-wide methylation levels within each context were not significantly different between flight and GC plants, for either leaves or roots (Figures 2E,F). However, met1-7 and elp2-5 both showed significant increases in methylation levels in spaceflight compared to GCs (Figures 2G–J). The elp2-5 mutants showed significant differences in the average genome-wide methylation levels between spaceflight and GCs in each organ and all methylation contexts (Figures 2G,H). The met1-7 mutants shared similar trends as the elp2-5 mutants in their leaves, however, significant differences between FT and GC were only seen in the CG context of root tissues (Figures 2I,J and Supplementary File 4) includes a detailed breakdown of the distribution of methylation levels, divided into bins ranging from 0 to 100% methylation.Spaceflight Changes in DNA Methylation Levels Were Associated With Protein-Coding Gene Regions Changes in DNA methylation induced by spaceflight associated with protein-coding and flanking genic regions [2 kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS), gene body (gold bar), and 2 kb downstream from transcription termination site] are shown in Figure 3. Pairwise comparison between each methylation mutant and the wild type control are depicted using plot lines color-coded to indicate the environmental conditions [flight, (F) and ground (G)], the genotype [Col-0 (C), elp2-5 (E), and met1-7 (M)] and the tissue type [leaves (L) and roots (R)], as indicated in the upper right legend of each comparison plot. Thus, the pink line in Figure 3A, FCL, reflects the percentage of average methylation for flight, Col-0 leaves across a 4 kb protein-coding region of the genome. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Pairwise comparison of the average methylation levels across protein-coding genes between the genotypes in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. Gene bodies from transcription start site (TSS) to transcription termination site (TTS; highlighted by the yellow bar) as well as the flanking upstream 2 kb and downstream 2 kb are shown. Each pairwise comparison between genotypes and environment is denoted by a three-letter code. The first letter denotes the environment [flight, (F) and ground (G)], the second letter denotes the genotype [Col-0 (C), elp2-5 (E), and met1-7 (M)], and the third letter denotes the specific tissue [leaves (L) and roots (R)]. The y axes indicate the average methylation levels in each of the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. A pairwise comparison between the various genotypes are depicted here Col-0 vs elp2-5 leaves (A) and roots (C), along with Col-0 vs met1-7 leaves (B) and roots (D).The elp2-5 and met1-7 lines differed in their methylation levels across genic regions compared to Col-0. In leaves, Col-0 and elp2-5 showed similar CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels across genic regions associated with protein-coding for both spaceflight and GC environments, as seen by the almost overlapping traces in Figure 3A. However, Col-0 and met1-7 leaves demonstrated notable differences in the CG methylation context. The met1-7 mutants had lower average CG methylation levels compared to Col-0 across all genic regions, with a pronounced difference within the gene body region (gold bar in graph). In spaceflight, met1-7 leaves have a higher methylation level across all genic regions when compared to the GCs (Figure 3B). The elp2-5 roots showed higher spaceflight-associated CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels across all genic regions compared to Col-0 (Figure 3C), but there were differences among the contexts with respect to the methylation levels for the other genotypes. In the CG methylation context, the GC Col-0 roots, GC elp2-5 roots, and flight Col-0 roots all had similar methylation levels, whereas flight elp2-5 roots showed increased methylation. In the CHG and CHH context, flight Col-0 roots had a slightly lower average methylation level across all genic regions when compared to GCs. The met1-7 roots demonstrated noticeable differences in the CG methylation context, with the most pronounced difference within the gene body region (Figure 3D). Flight Col-0 roots had a lower CG methylation level across the gene body regions when compared to the GCs. The flight met1-7 roots had a higher CG methylation level across flanking upstream and downstream genic regions compared to their GCs. In the CHG methylation contexts, there were no obvious differences between Col-0 and met1-7 genotypes in either flight or GCs. In the CHH context, flight Col-0 roots, GC met1-7 roots, and flight met1-7 roots had similar methylation levels, levels that were slightly lower than GC Col-0 roots (Figure 3D).Spaceflight Altered the Distribution and Direction of DmCs in elp2-5 and met1-7 Leaves and Roots The distribution of cytosines differentially methylated by spaceflight within each methylation context in both leaves and roots was assessed for each mutant relative to the wild-type genotype. DmCs were identified as those cytosines with a differential methylation that was statistically significant to p < 0.01 in each comparison and context (Figure 4). The percentage of DmCs was also mapped to different genomic regions for each methylation context. The percentage maps of Upstream (2 kb upstream of the TSS), UTRs, Exons, Introns, Downstream (2 kb downstream of the polyadenylation site), transposable element, Intergenic, and Pseudogenes are shown for each genotype in the flight vs ground comparisons of leaves and roots (Supplementary Figure 3). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs) of leaves and roots from each genotype in response to spaceflight. (A) Breakdown of each methylation context for DmCs in leaves and roots of Col-0, elp2, and met1-7 in spaceflight compared to ground control. (B) Total number of DmCs broken down in each context for all three genotypes in leaves and roots. (C) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total leaf DmCs in each context – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black. (D) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total root DmCs in each context.In spaceflight, the percentage of DmCs of elp2-5 relative to Col-0 in leaves is highest in the CHH context (53%; Figure 4A), whereas in the GCs the percentage was highest in the CG context (47%). Similarly, spaceflight roots (Figure 4B) had a higher percentage of DmCs in the CHH context (60%), while in GC roots the majority of the DmCs were divided about equally between CHH (42%) and CG (43%) contexts. In all cases, the percentages of DmCs in the CHG context in the elp2-5 plants changed very little among organs and environments (15–18%). Most of the elp2-5 DmCs were hypermethylated (Figures 4A,B). In the met1-7 and Col-0 comparison, the majority of the DmCs were in the CG context in both leaves and roots, and both organs had lower percentages of CG DmCs in FT than in GC (Figures 4C,D). In leaves, this decrease in the percentage of CG DmCs in FT compared to GC was larger in leaves (13%) compared to roots (3%). In addition, there was a 10% increase in the percentage of CHH DmCs in FT (29%) compared to GC (19%) in the leaves (Figure 4C). In roots, there was only a 1% increase in FT compared to GC (Figure 4D). As was seen in the elp2-5 plants, the percentage of CHG DmCs changed very little among organs and environments (10–13%). Most of the met1-7 DmCs were hypomethylated (Figures 4C,D). The distribution of gene-related DmCs in response to spaceflight was genotype- and organ-specific (Figure 5). In Col-0 leaves, DmCs were primarily hypomethylated. In the upstream and downstream flanking regions, the CHH context predominated, but within the gene body the CHH and CG contexts were about equally represented, and CGH methylation the least represented (Figure 5A). In contrast, in both elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves the DmCs were primarily hypermethylated (Figures 5B,C). In elp2-5 leaves methylation in the CHH context predominated in loci within all genic regions (Figure 5B). In met1-7 leaves the CG and CHH contexts were about equally represented in all genic regions (Figure 5C). In Col-0 roots, DmCs were again primarily hypomethylated, but unlike in leaves, the CHH context predominated within all genic regions (Figure 5D). As with leaves, the DmCs in both elp2-5 and met1-7 roots were predominantly hypermethylated (Figures 5E,F). In elp2-5 roots, methylation of DmCs in the CHH context again predominated in loci within all genic regions, and loci with CG and CHG methylation were about equally distributed in each genic region (Figure 5E). In met1-7 roots, DmCs with methylation in the CHH contexts were slightly more abundant across all genic regions, but methylation in all contexts was higher in the downstream genic region (Figure 5F). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Methylation context breakdown of DmCs mapped to different genic features in spaceflight vs ground comparisons. Leaf and Root DMCs of Col-0 (A,D) elp2-5 (B,E), and met1-7 (C,F) in response to spaceflight are mapped to genic features such as; upstream (2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site), gene body (exons, introns, and both 5′ and 3′ UTRs), and downstream (2,000 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site). The corresponding methylation direction in each context is also illustrated – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black.Each genotype displayed distinct, organ-specific distributions of DMRs between spaceflight and the GCs (Figure 6). DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within 100 bp windows between FT and GC, and regions with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) were used in the analysis. In the Col-0 spaceflight response, 659 DMRs were detected in leaves, and 765 DMRs in roots. In both Col-0 tissues, an average of 51% of the DMRs were found within the CHH context, whereas the other half of the DMR were evenly distributed between the CHG and CG contexts at 24.5% each. In elp2-5, there were 717 DMRs in leaves and 2,974 DMRs in roots (Figure 6A). In both elp2-5 tissues, an average of 63% of the DMRs were found in the CHH context, which was 12% more than Col-0. DMRs in the CHG context were distributed similarly to that of Col-0 at an average of 25%, however, DMRs in the CG context were at an average of 12.5% which was about half that of Col-0. In met1-7, there were 6,114 DMRs in leaves and 3,745 DMRs in roots. The majority of the DMRs in both tissues were in the CG context at an average of 83%. DMRs in the CHG context in both tissues were at an average of 8.5% whereas DMRs in the CHH context averaged 12% in the leaves and 5% in the roots (Figure 6A). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of leaves and roots from each genotype in response to spaceflight. (A) Breakdown of each methylation context for DMRs in leaves and roots of Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7 in spaceflight compared to ground control. (B) Breakdown of the methylation direction of total leaf/root DMRs in each genotype in response to spaceflight – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black. (C) Distribution of leaf and root gene-related DMRs of Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7 in response to spaceflight. DMRs are mapped to genic features such as; upstream (2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site), gene body (exons, introns, and both 5′ and 3′ UTRs), and downstream (2,000 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site). The corresponding methylation direction in each context is also illustrated – Hypomethylation (Hypo) gray and Hypermethylation (Hyper) black.The spaceflight-associated DMRs in Col-0 were distributed between hypo and hypermethylation, while hypomethylated DMRs predominated in the mutants. In Col-0 leaves, 39% of the DMRs were hypomethylated and 61% hypermethylated, whereas in Col-0 roots, 67% of the DMRs were hypomethylated and 33% were hypermethylated. However, in both elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves and roots, DMRs were predominantly hypermethylated ranging from 97 to 99% (Figure 6B). Gene-related DMRs (Figure 6C) reflected organ-specific responses to spaceflight in all genotypes, but the largest difference in the number of DMR loci between leaves and roots was in elp2-5. In Col-0 leaves and roots, the number of DMRs in all genic regions and context was less than 400, with the highest number of DMRs found within the CHH context. In gene-related DMRs in Col-0 leaves hypo- and hypermethylation were fairly evenly distributed across all contexts, whereas in Col-0 roots, gene-related DMRs were mostly hypomethylated (70%). In Col-0 leaves and roots, gene-related DMRs were most abundant in the gene body region. In contrast to wild-type Col-0, the total gene-related DMRs in elp2-5 were substantially higher in the roots compared to the leaves. In elp2-5 roots, DMRs were primarily in the CHH context and were predominantly hypermethylated in all genic regions. The highest number of DMRs in the elp2-5 roots were within the gene body region. In met1-7, DMRs were found at a higher number in the leaves compared to the roots. DMRs in both leaves and roots were predominantly hypermethylated and were distributed primarily in the CG context. In met1-7 leaves, the highest number of DMRs were located upstream of the TSS (Figure 6C).Spaceflight Affected More Genes in the Roots of elp2-5, and More Genes in the Leaves of met1-7 Spaceflight associated differential gene expression was genotype- and organ-specific; in elp2-5 more genes were affected in roots, while in met1-7 more genes were affected in leaves (Figure 7). Transcripts showing at least a twofold change (−1 ≤ log2 FC ≥ 1) with an FDR value of < 0.05 were identified as DEGs. PCAs of each type of tissue were performed individually, as leaves and roots have widely different patterns of gene expression (Paul et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2019). The PCA plots of leaves and roots showed different grouping of elp2-5 samples along with the components compared to Col-0 and met1-7 (Supplementary File 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). In the comparison of spaceflight to ground leaves, Col-0 had a total of 207 (123 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated) DEGs, elp2-5 had 36 (26 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) DEGs, and met1-7 had 226 (160 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated) DEGs (Figure 7A). In roots, a total of 147 (28 up-regulated and 119 down-regulated), 120 (50 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated), and 47 (39 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated) DEGs were found in Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7, respectively (Figure 7B). Only a few DEGs overlapped between the genotypes in both leaf and root tissues (Figures 7C,D). In leaves, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and met1-7, whereas, in roots, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and elp2-5 (Figures 7C,D). The patterns of DEGs in all three genotypes were distinctly organ-specific, and of the 436 DEGs in leaves and 288 in roots, only 35 DEGs were common to both sets (Figure 7E). Although there were overall fewer root-specific DEGs, a greater proportion of the root DEGs were also differentially methylated in response to spaceflight compared to the DEGs of leaves. In roots, 82% of the DEGs also exhibited DmCs, whereas in leaves, 31% of the DEGs also mapped to DmCs (Figure 7F and Supplementary File 5). FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Analysis of differential gene expression in response to spaceflight and the relationship between DmCs.

(F) Bar graph showing the percentage of DmCs that mapped to DEGs in leaves (gray bar) and in roots (black bars).The composition of DmC-DEGs in elp2-5 compared to Col-0 was distinctive in each environmental and organ comparison (Figure 8). In leaves, elp2-5 vs Col-0 on the ground had a total of 2,119 DEGs (1,322 up-regulated and 797 down-regulated) whereas in spaceflight there were a total of 2,149 DEGs (1,448 up-regulated and 701 down-regulated; Figure 8A). Of these, 996 DEGs were also differentially methylated in the GCs, and a total of 1,188 DmC-DEGs were observed in spaceflight (Figure 8B). A total of 497 DmCs-DEGs were shared between both environmental conditions. In roots, the pairwise comparison of elp2-5 and Col-0 revealed a total of 1,667 (725 up-regulated and 942 down-regulated) DEGs on the ground and 1,626 (724 up-regulated and 902 down-regulated) DEGs in spaceflight (Figure 8C). Of these, 1,222 DEGs on the ground were also associated with DmCs and 1,481 DEGs in spaceflight were associated with DmCs. Among these, 723 DmC-DEGs were shared in both spaceflight and GC conditions (Figure 8D). A visual heat-map summary of the organ-specific distribution of DEGs and the DmC-DEGs for all genotypes is presented in the Supplementary Figure 2, which is annotated in Supplementary File 6. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Pairwise comparison of elp2-5 mutant vs wild-type Col-0 DEGs-DmCs on the ground and in spaceflight.

(E) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of DmC-DEG genes in elp2-5 vs Col-0 comparison of both leaves and roots in each environment (GC and FT). The heatmap shows the GO terms that were enriched within each environment and tissue combination between elp2-5 and Col-0. The scale bar represents the negative Log10 of the q-values (corrected p-values) from the “test of significance of enrichment” within each list of DmC-DEGs. The q-value cutoff was set at 0.05. Higher values in the scaling indicate higher significance of the enrichment.Multiple metabolic processes appeared to be altered in elp2-5 compared to Col-0 (Figure 8E). GO analysis of the DmC-DEGs of elp2-5 compared to Col-0 showed that elp2-5 was engaged with many processes characteristic of stress responses (Figure 8E). Processes shared as enriched between leaf and root DmC-DEGs included general responses to stimuli, oxidoreductase activities, and heme-binding. Leaf-specific DmC-DEGs were enriched in biosynthetic processes of flavonoids and pigments, jasmonic acid, and wounding responses in both GC and FT. DmC-DEGs in GC leaves were more specifically enriched in phenylpropanoid metabolism and the response to oxidative stress, as well as in further oxidoreducatase and peroxidase activities. DmC-DEGs in FT leaves were enriched with defense and hypoxia responses. DmC-DEGs annotated to the plasma membrane and extracellular structures were enriched among both GC and FT roots, in addition to transport processes and activities. Carbohydrate transport and binding were specifically enriched among root GC DmC-DEGs. Thus, elp2-5 shows differential expression and methylation of stress and hormone response pathways, as well as transport and metabolic pathways, when compared to the Col-0 wild-type line within each tissue and growth condition. Relative to the Col-0 response, there were substantially more DEGs and DmCs in elp2-5 (Figure 8) than were seen in met1-7 (Figure 9). In leaves, elp2-5 vs Col-0 showed a total of 2,119 (1,322 up-regulated and 797 down-regulated) DEGs in GC, whereas 2,149 (1,448 up-regulated and 701 down-regulated) DEGs were observed in FT (Figure 8A). DmC-DEGs in the elp2-5 to Col-0 leaves comparison revealed 996 differentially methylated and expressed transcripts on the GC and 1,188 in FT, of which 499 were unique to GC, 691 unique to FT, and 497 were shared among both conditions (Figure 8B). In the roots, the pairwise comparison of elp2-5 and Col-0 in the GC revealed a total of 1,667 (725 up-regulated and 942 down-regulated) DEGs and a total of 1,626 (724 up-regulated and 902 down-regulated) DEGs in FT (Figure 8C). DmC-DEGs in the elp2-5 to Col-0 roots comparison revealed a total of 1,222 DmC-DEGs in GC roots and 1,481 DmC-DEGs in FT roots, of which 723 were shared in both conditions (Figure 8D). In leaves, met1-7 vs Col-0 showed a total of 840 (355 up-regulated and 485 down-regulated) DEGs in GC, whereas in FT 637 (375 up-regulated and 262 down-regulated) DEGs were observed (Figure 9A). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to Col-0 leaves comparison revealed 527 differentially methylated and expressed transcripts on the ground and 408 in flight, of which 261 were unique to GC, 142 unique to FT, and 266 were shared among both conditions (Figure 9B). In the roots, the pairwise comparison of met1-7 and Col-0 in the GC revealed a total of 779 (343 up-regulated and 436 down-regulated) DEGs and a total of 593 (369 up-regulated and 224 down-regulated) DEGs in spaceflight (Figure 9C). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to Col-0 roots comparison revealed a total of 648 DmC-DEGs in GC roots and 430 DmC-DEGs in FT roots, of which 313 were shared in both conditions (Figure 9D). FIGURE 9.

The scale bar represents the negative Log10 of the q-values (corrected p-values) from the “test of significance of enrichment” within each list of DmC-DEGs. The q-value cutoff was set at 0.05. Higher values in the scaling indicate higher significance of the enrichment.Gene ontology analysis of DmC-DEGs between met1-7 and the wild-type line yielded few term enrichments (Figure 8E). Biological process enrichments associated with hypoxic responses and biosynthesis of anthocyanin-containing compounds were present in GC root DmC-DEGs. Molecular functions of ADP binding, sesquiterpene compound synthase activities, and cell wall constituents, and nutrient reservoir activity were enriched in leaf GC DmC-DEGs, leaf FT DmC-DEGs, and root GC DmC-DEGs, respectively. Alignments of DmC-DEGs in each methylation context in the various genic regions were generated for each genotype and depicted as heatmaps (Figure 10). In leaves, a total of 59 DmC-DEGs were observed in wild-type Col-0, while in elp2-5 and met1-7, there were 11 and 72 DmC-DEGs, respectively. Correlations between differential expression and DNA methylation were used to organize the heatmap. The top bracketed sections of the heatmaps show negative correlations where up-regulated genes aligned with hypomethylated DmCs and down-regulated genes aligned with hypermethylated DmCs are grouped. The following bracketed section shows positive correlations where the converse relationship between DEGs and DmCs was highlighted. The unbracketed section at the bottom of the heatmap shows genes that have no distinguishable correlations between DEGs and DmCs. In Col-0 leaves, 41% (24 out of 59) of genes had a negative correlation and 49% (29 out of 59) had a positive correlation. In elp2-5 leaves, negative and positive correlation were evenly distributed at 45% (5 out of 11), whereas in met1-7 leaves, 26% (19 out of 72) of genes showed a negative correlation and 60% (43 out of 72) had a positive correlation. In roots, there were a total of 114 DmC-DEGs in Col-0, 101 DmC-DEGs in elp2-5, and 28 DmC-DEGs in met1-7 (Figure 11). 16% (19 out of 114) of the wild-type Col-0 root DmC-DEGs had a negative correlation between gene expression and methylation levels, whereas 66% (75 out of 114) were positively correlated. In elp2-5 roots, 54% (55 out of 101) of genes showed a negative correlation, and 42% (42 out of 101) showed a positive correlation. In met1-7 roots, 36% (10 out of 28) of genes showed a negative correlation, and 50% (14 out of 28) showed a positive correlation. FIGURE 10.

In Col-0 leaves, DmC-DEGs were enriched in localization to glyoxosomes (Figure 12A). The DmC-DEGs observed in the spaceflight response of met1-7 leaves were in pathways associated with the metabolism of pigments containing anthocyanins. The enrichments among the Col-0 root FT vs GC DmC-DEGs were primarily associated with defense pathways and responses to hypoxia, as well as the cell wall and membrane nanodomains (Figure 12B and Supplementary Table 1). Col-0 and elp2-5 roots showed enrichments of molecular function GO terms, involving FAD and manganese ion binding, and carbonate dehydratase activity, respectively. A secondary analysis using all FT vs GC DEGs showed that the analysis of only DmC-DEGs recapitulated the majority of the terms associated with the overall transcriptomic response to spaceflight (data not shown). The GO-associated processes, localizations, and functions represented by these terms are gained or lost from the methylation-sensitive aspect of the spaceflight response dependent on the functionality of ELP2 and MET1.

Higher values in the scaling indicate higher significance of the enrichment.Discussion DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses and physiological adaptation in plants (Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010; Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Garg et al., 2015; Tameshige et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019). Physiological adaptation to spaceflight engages gene expression changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses (Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Blancaflor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Zupanska et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014; Nakashima et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Barker et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019; Kruse et al., 2020; Supplementary Table 2). In addition, the first whole-genome survey of DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown entirely in the spaceflight environment showed correlated changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs in spaceflight, especially in stress response genes such as those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). However, such correlations do not establish a functional connection between DNA methylation and physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation, were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type. The assays for response to spaceflight were overall growth and morphology, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles. The elp2-5 plants failed to grow normally in spaceflight (Figure 1A). Previous experiments have shown that in the microgravity of spaceflight, plant root growth is altered compared to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional light, roots generally grow away from the light source and establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally healthy-looking morphology (Paul et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2019). However, the roots of the elp2-5 plants in spaceflight did not set up this typical spaceflight directionality, as the roots did not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass of the elp2-5 plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, all of the biomass of the elp2-5 spaceflight plants was concentrated into the area very near the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is also apparent in the elp2-5 spaceflight transcriptome. The leaves of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants appeared to be less expanded, more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than the leaves of the GCs (Figure 1C). The elp2-5 mutants generally exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can be further exacerbated by stress (Zhou et al., 2009). This distinct, spaceflight-dependent, morphology for elp2-5 plants suggests that elp2-5 plants are physiologically maladapted to spaceflight. While it has been established that ELP2 has a role in root development (e.g., Jia et al., 2015) the spaceflight data suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in gravity perception and root navigation. In terrestrial environments, where gravity can impart a tropic force, plants lacking ELP2 have shorter roots but grow reasonably well (Jia et al., 2015). However, in the absence of gravity, elp2-5 mutant roots appear to lose the ability to navigate effectively away from the site of the germinating seed. The met1-7 plants appeared better able to cope with the absence of gravity than elp2-5 plants, as their spaceflight root growth patterns were similar to Col-0, with no obvious deleterious morphologies seen on orbit (Figure 1C). The met1-7 plants produced as much biomass on orbit as in the GCs (Supplementary Figure 1) and established a root growth pattern that was visually typical of spaceflight growth (Paul et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2019) and similar to the appearance of Col-0 (Figure 1C). The differential spaceflight morphologies of elp2-5 and met1-7 suggest that the DNA methylation events conditioned by MET1 and ELP2 differentially affect spaceflight physiological adaptation and success. Since MET1 and ELP2 represent two different mechanisms that affect methylation, these results suggest that spaceflight might affect the methylation of specific genes more than the genome-wide status of methylation. The degree of genome-wide methylation was not statistically different between spaceflight and GCs for Col-0, but both elp2-5 and met1-7 were generally hypermethylated compared to the GCs (Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1). This result reinforces the conclusion that changes in overall average genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild-type plants, as this result was also seen in the spaceflight methylome of Arabidopsis cultivar WS (Zhou et al., 2019). However, the hypermethylation of the mutant genomes suggested that the respective contributions of MET1 and ELP2 are important to maintaining an appropriate degree of genome-wide methylation in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The degree of DNA methylation within each context in elp2-5 was significantly increased in response to spaceflight in both leaves and roots (Figures 2G,H) compared to the degree of methylation of these mutants with respect to wild type in the GCs. However, there was a distinction between the two mutant lines in the degree and context of methylation in the respective root genomes. The spaceflight elp2-5 root genome was significantly hypermethylated in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) compared to the GCs, whereas only CG methylation was elevated in the spaceflight met1-7 genome (Figures 2D,H,J). Although the contribution of CHG and CHH methylation in Arabidopsis is generally small (about 14%; Niederhuth et al., 2016) it is possible that while genome-wide changes in CG methylation does not impact spaceflight root growth morphology, changes in the CHG and CHH context may contribute to the spaceflight phenotype of elp2-5 plants. The degree of spaceflight methylation across protein-coding regions showed organ-specificity among all genotypes. Methylation in the protein coding regions is relevant to gene expression profiles, which are also highly organ specific. Spaceflight induced more CG methylation across all protein-coding regions (upstream, gene body, and downstream) in met1-7 leaves and only increased methylation in the upstream and downstream regions in roots (Figure 3). Conversely, elp2-5 methylation was increased across all protein-coding regions and methylation contexts only in the roots in response to spaceflight (Figure 3). The substantial increase in CHH methylation in elp2-5 roots (Figures 4A,B) suggests that ELP2 plays a dominant role in governing the spaceflight-associated methylation changes in the roots, specifically in the CHH context. This correlates with the root growth morphology exhibited by elp2-5. Col-0, met1-7, and elp2-5 are each different in their spaceflight gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. The profiles of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes in both elp2-5 and met1-7 were unique compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figures 10, 11 and Supplementary Figure 2). The loss of MET1 and ELP2 each had a substantial influence on the profiles of DEGs and differentially methylated genes in response to the spaceflight environment. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the elp2-5 spaceflight plants indicate that the spaceflight plants are under considerable stress compared to GCs. Almost a third of the genes uniquely induced in the spaceflight elp2-5 leaves are associated with nutrient stress, and most of the rest are genes associated with heat stress, ROS and pathogen responses. These gene classes were also noticeably represented among the elp2-5 spaceflight root DEGs. These gene expression patterns describe a highly stressed response reflecting the compact growth morphology of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the met1-7 spaceflight plants suggest that met1-7 plants were better adjusted to spaceflight than the elp2-5 plants. As with the elp2-5 plants, the met1-7 plants present a number of stress-associated DEGs. However, in contrast to the types of genes expressed by spaceflight elp2-5 plants, the DEGs in spaceflight met1-7 plants predominantly functioned in signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 6). While organ-specific differences in the gene expression patterns of various Arabidopsis tissue types (leaves, hypocotyls, roots, and root tips) have been previously reported in spaceflight transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), the met1-7 and elp2-5 plant lines each demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. A large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) and met1-7 (72 out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of differentially methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out of 147) and elp2-5 (101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes, suggesting that unique organ-specific mechanisms were engaged for spaceflight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots, in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression in spaceflight were complex and differed between leaves and roots. In wild-type Col-0 leaves, the hypomethylated DmCs and hypermethylated DmCs were evenly distributed across all contexts and all genic regions (Figure 5A). The association of changes in methylation with gene expression showed an even proportion of positive and negative correlation. In met1-7 leaves, DmCs were predominantly hypermethylated in the CG and CHH contexts of downstream regions, and a larger proportion of positive correlations were observed among DmC-DEGs (Figure 10). In elp2-5 roots, DmCs were primarily hypermethylated in the CHH context across all genic regions, yet a larger proportion of DmC-DEGs showed a negative correlation (Figure 11). These observations are in contrast with other studies that report a strong negative correlation between promoter CG methylation and gene expression levels (Finnegan et al., 1996; Garg et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2015). Further investigations may clarify the relationship between leaf spaceflight transcript abundance and methylation in different contexts and genic regions. However, 80% of DEGs (across all genotypes) were also differentially methylated in roots. In leaves, that average was only 30% (Figure 7F). These data suggest that DNA methylation plays a significantly larger role in regulating the genes associated with the spaceflight response in roots than in leaves. The genes differentially regulated by elp2-5 and met1-7 in spaceflight were from distinctly different metabolic processes than those regulated in Col-0 in response to spaceflight. Functional analyses of DmC-DEGs showed sharp contrasts among elp2-5 and met1-7 with the Col-0 wild-type. The mutant elp2-5 line showed differential methylation and expression of gene classes traditionally associated with the spaceflight response and other abiotic stresses, such as metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses across tissue types (Figure 8E; Cramer et al., 2011). The mutant met1-7 line, conversely, demonstrated relatively few GO term enrichments, indicating that DmC-DEGs tended to result from largely untargeted changes in methylation (Figure 9E). ELP2 regulates root growth and development, and elp2 loss of function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype may be linked to the root-specific involvement of DmC-DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and extracellular localization observed in this study (Figures 1C, 8E; Jia et al., 2015). The spaceflight-associated processes that are differentially represented in elp2-5 are also among the primary classes enriched in DmC-DEGs involved in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0 (Figures 8E, 12). These data suggest that the spaceflight response works more directly through DNA methylation mechanisms and other mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through the maintenance mechanisms represented by MET1. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). The response to spaceflight includes differential DNA methylation in a manner that is similar to known terrestrial stress responses, particularly those associated with pathogen attack or harsh environments. Supplementary Table 2 provides a comparison of these spaceflight-associated DmC-DEGs with those from several terrestrial studies of environmental stress responses (Yong-Villalobos et al., 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017, 2018; Stassen et al., 2018; Korotko et al., 2021). This correlation strongly suggests that the spaceflight response, though novel, utilizes a range of mechanistic approaches that are typically employed during terrestrial environmental stress. While direct methylation mechanisms represented by MET1 certainly affect the spaceflight response in terms of gene expression profiles, the indirect DNA demethylation/methylation mechanisms associated with ELP2 have a more profound role than MET1 in the spaceflight response.Conclusion Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants.Data Availability Statement The original contributions presented in the study are publicly available.

    "abstract": "Abstract The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.

Since the return to the Moon is envisioned as a dedicated, longer-term commitment to lunar exploration, questions of the lunar environmental impact on biology and biological systems have become a significant part of the lunar exploration agenda. Plants have long been envisioned as part of lunar habitats4–8 and exploration environments9,10. However, until the current study, the interactions between lunar materials and terrestrial biology were unaddressed in the era of modern molecular biology, and there had yet to be any experiments where plants were actually grown in the true lunar regolith. Understanding the impact of sustained exposure of terrestrial biology to lunar regolith, and determining the efficacy of lunar regolith as a viable in situ resource, is important to the concept of returning to the Moon for long durations. Therefore, we used plant growth and gene expression (e.g., 11–13) to both tests the fundamental impact of lunar regolith on terrestrial biology, and provide an initial evaluation of regolith as a matrix for plant growth systems in lunar exploration habitats. Plants are key components of the biological sciences within and in support of space exploration. As model organisms, plants provide insights into gravity, radiation, and other space-related biological phenomena, and therefore help drive an understanding of the physiological adaptation of terrestrial biology to space exploration environments. There is an expanding wealth of literature documenting this progress, e.g., 11,14–19. Plants also make available potentially essential components to the long-term habitation of space and extraterrestrial surfaces by providing food and oxygen, recycling water, and scrubbing carbon dioxide from human habitats. However, many designs of extraterrestrial plant growth systems largely rely on hydroponic systems20,21, in part due to the lack of information on the efficacy of using in situ materials, such as planetary regolith, as a growth substrate. Information on plant growth in lunar regolith, therefore, informs fundamental biology interactions within the lunar environment, and helps scale options for the use of plants in lunar life support scenarios. The Apollo Moon landings were a critical point in the science of space exploration, not only in the accomplishment of lunar visits, but also in that terrestrial biology would be in contact with extraterrestrial material, and samples of that material would be intentionally returned to Earth. The first contact between terrestrial biology and lunar regolith was an unprecedented concern for protecting both the astronauts visiting the Moon as well as the entire Earth biosphere from the potentially harmful effects of returned lunar materials. Novel, extraterrestrial pathogenic microorganisms were the main concern, in addition to toxic mineral compositions and abrasive physical characteristics. To protect the returning human explorers and the terrestrial biosphere, the astronauts and attending medical staff were isolated for 2 weeks upon the return of the early Apollo crews (e.g., 22). In addition, lunar samples were intensively isolated in specialized facilities at the Johnson Space Center Lunar Receiving Laboratory23,24, where the samples were handled in gloveboxes roughly equivalent to current high-level biological containment. The primary goal was to search for pathogens, and those search procedures relied on direct, though largely transient contact between lunar materials and biology. In the specific case of plants, lunar samples were rubbed onto leaf surfaces and sprinkled onto seedlings and growth media25, but plants were never grown in lunar regolith as the support matrix25–27. This gap in knowledge is addressed in the following experiment. We asked the two-tiered question of whether plants can develop successfully in lunar regolith, and if so, what metabolic strategies, as suggested by differential transcriptomes, were utilized to physiologically adapt to growth in this novel environment. Arabidopsis was seeded directly onto samples from Apollo 11 (10084), 12 (12070), and 17 (70051) (Fig. 1a), which represent diverse regolith types. The Apollo 11 and 12 samples are mature and submature regoliths, respectively, due to their relatively long exposure to the lunar surface, whereas the Apollo 17 sample is an immature, shorter surface exposure regolith mixture from multiple areas at the Apollo 17 site28–31. All are from areas of the Moon dominated by basaltic mineralogy28–31. The lunar simulant JSC-1A29,32,33 was used for the terrestrial control material. All lunar regolith samples, as well as the JSC-1A simulant used for controls, were samples sieved to <1 mm particle size. Fig. 1. Lunar regolith sources and experiment set up. Open in a new tab a A summary table of lunar sample sources50. b We used four replicate plates, each 48-well cell culture plate contained four wells of JSC-1A simulant and three of lunar regolith (one well each per plate) – Apollo 11 (A11), Apollo 12 (A12), Apollo 17 (A17). c Each well contained 900 mg of regolith material layered over a 0.45-micron filter and Rockwool wick and was sown with 3-5 Arabidopsis seeds suspended in water (also Supplementary Fig. 1). Lunar In Situ images are publicly available from NASA archives. There area few notable mineralogical and compositional differences between the lunar regoliths and JSC-1A. The lunar samples used here contain 30–52 vol. % agglutinates, which are aggregates containing mineral fragments, nanophase metallic Fe, trapped gases, and glass that form due to micrometeorite impacts28,29. Agglutinate and nanophase Fe abundance both increases with regolith maturity as prolonged surface exposure to the solar wind reduces particle size, the increases the conversion rate of grains of Fe metal to nanophase Fe28,29. Many regolith simulants such as JSC-1A contain abundant natural volcanic glass, e.g., 29, but this material does not fully replicate agglutinate assemblages or morphologies. Additionally, the overall Fe oxidation state of the lunar samples differs from that of JSC-1A. Although to our knowledge, Fe oxidation state ratios have not been quantified in these samples, lunar regolith ubiquitously contains nanophase metallic Fe (partially within agglutinates) in addition to solely Fe2+ in mafic silicates and oxides34, whereas JSC-1A is known to contain Fe3+-bearing Fe-Ti oxides (namely magnetite and chromite) in addition to some proportion of Fe3+ in its silicates and glass. Lastly, two of the lunar regoliths (10084 and 70051) are derived from high-Ti basaltic bedrock and have TiO2 abundances of 5–7 wt.%, which is considerably higher than that of JSC-1A at 1.85 wt.%, e.g., 29.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials All seeds used in the experiment were from the same batch of seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) (TAIR CS70000)48. Lunar regolith materials The lunar Allocation Analysis Review Board/AARB (formerly CAPTEM), through the Apollo Sample Curator at Johnson Space Center (Ryan Ziegler), provided 4 × 1 g samples of regolith from Apollo 11 (10084—2075, 2076, 2077, 2078), Apollo 12 (12070—105, 99,106, 109) and Apollo 17 (70051—159, 160, 161, 162) (Fig. 1a). An example of an Apollo 12 sample before opening is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A. All lunar samples were of particle size <1 mm. These regoliths, along with the NASA lunar simulant JSC-1A (Orbitec JSC-1A Lunar, particle size <1 mm), were used as the substrate for plant growth. Plant growth plate configuration and habitat Plants grew in 900 mg of material; four replicates form each site, alongside 16 replicates of JSC-1A simulant (also 900 mg each). The replicates were arranged in four, 48-well cell culture plates (Nunc 48-well sterile culture plate, cat.# 150687) such that each plate held a replicate of each Apollo site regolith (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig.1B), and four replicates of JSC-1A. Each well is 12.5 mm in diameter and 15 mm deep. The plates were prepared with the following steps: Drainage holes were drilled in a specific configuration to distinguish groups of JSC-1A and lunar samples and then labeled (Plate 1, Plate 2, Plate 3, Plate 4) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The subsurface irrigation system was created by inserting 10 mm × 15 mm cylinders of Rockwool such that a tuft of fibers extends from the bottom of the drainage hole, which compresses the plug to about 7 mm thickness within the well. The plug of Rockwool is topped with a 13 mm circle of a nylon 0.45 μm filter to help prevent regolith from sieving into the plug (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Rockwool is a commercially available (e.g., Grodan®) material composed of spun basalt fibers compressed into formable slabs. The material is chemically and biologically inert, and widely used in plant growth applications; it could conceivably be produced from lunar basalts in situ. The Rockwool plugs in the growth plates were moistened with a nutrient solution of 0.125× strength MS nutrient solution, pH 5.7 (Murashige and Skoog49) by placing the plates in trays of the solution to soak the plugs from below, and then allowed to drain. Next, 900 mg of each regolith sample (or JSC-1A) was added to the designated wells (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and then the plates were returned to trays of nutrient solution to wet the regolith in contact with the Rockwool plug (Supplementary Fig. 1E). The Apollo 17 samples wetted completely through capillary action (as did the JSC-1A controls), however, the Apollo 11 and 12 samples were hydrophobic and initially failed to wet using the subsurface irrigation procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1F). The Apollo 11 and 12 samples were therefore actively stirred with nutrient solution to overcome the hydrophobicity, and once wetted, the samples behaved physically similar to JSC-1A and Apollo 17 (Supplementary Fig. 1G). When all samples were evenly wet with nutrient solution, Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds were distributed with a micro-pipette to the surface of each well (Supplementary Fig. 1H), and then the plates were transferred to vented terrarium chambers (Supplementary Fig. 1I) to reduce airflow yet allow air exchange with the surrounding environment. The growth plates were moistened with nutrient solution daily by placing the plates in trays of solution until the regolith was wetted from below and then allowed to drain. The Rockwool plugs wick liquid very effectively, but also drains readily and does not retain much water. This property of Rockwool helped prevent the regolith from becoming waterlogged. The plates of plants were photographed daily. Between days 6 and 8, the seedlings were thinned to a single plant in each well by drawing out with forceps (Supplementary Fig. 1J). On day 20 the aerial portions of the plants (leaves and hypocotyl) were harvested by cutting at soil-level with scissors to labeled micro-centrifuge tubes (Supplementary Fig. 1J) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Calibrations with simulants for experimental design The above approaches and protocols were based on a set of calibration experiments conducted prior to working with lunar materials. Experiments were conducted in the 48-well culture plate form-factor with two JSC planetary simulants (Orbitec JSC-1A Lunar and JSC-Mars-1A) and commercial potting soil. All materials were sized to a collection of particles <1 mm; the JSC materials we obtained pre-sieved to that particle size fraction, and the soil was sieved in the laboratory. The plates were configured as described above with rockwool plugs and filters, and watered from below with a 0.125× MS nutrient solution. The success of this approach informed the lunar materials experiment configuration (Supplementary Fig. 3A). The concentration of the MS nutrient solution was optimized in earlier experiments using 200-well seed starting trays. Serial dilutions of 1× strength MS nutrients were compared to deionized water. A concentration of 0.125× MS supported optimal growth in a JSC-1A substrate. Plants that received water alone in the JSC-1A substrate did not develop past the first set of true leaves (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Since the nutrient composition of JSC-1A is comparable to that of the lunar regolith used in this study50,51 (Supplementary Data 4) it was concluded that supplementary nutrients would be necessary for successful plant growth in lunar regolith as well, but there was insufficient lunar regolith available to test this assumption. RNA isolation and sequencing RNA isolation and sequencing were after the approaches described in Paul et al.15. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines RNA concentration was determined on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). First, 50 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). Then followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First-Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, RRID:SCR_019145). Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, RRID:SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950 Gb) with an average Q30% ≥ 92.5% and Cluster PF = 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2 × 150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 Million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples. RNASeq bioinformatics RNASeq Bioinformatic approaches have been previously described in Paul et al.15. The quality of the RNASeq sequence data was evaluated using FastQC and low-quality bases trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic52,53. STAR Aligner54 was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome, and Gene expression values were calculated using RSEM55. The edgeR linear regression model56 was used to perform the differential gene analysis. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were conducted to evaluate the association of the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of >2, and the average FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn57. Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data were performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/bioinformatics/; RRID:SCR_019120). Statistics and reproducibility The experiment compared plant growth and transcriptomes of JSC-1A lunar simulant to plants grown in regolith from three different Apollo lunar landing sites: Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 17; JSC-1A served as the control, the three Apollo sites were the treatments. The plants were grown in sets on four replicated 48-well growth plates, each composed of four samples of JSC-1A controls (n = 16 total) one representative of each lunar site on each plate (n = 4 total). The individual plate configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1. For the transcriptome analyses, four replicates were used for the control and for each treatment (for JSC-1A, plant #4 from each plate was used) in order to have n = 4 controls for parity to the lunar samples. However one of the replicates in Apollo 11 did not provide viable RNA, and so for the transcriptome analyses of Apollo 11 treatment n = 3, while the Apollo 12 and Apollo 17 treatments n = 4. The statistical methods employed for the transcriptome bioinformatics are described in the Bioinformatics Methods section. The quantitative growth graphs in Supplementary Fig. 4 were derived from the daily photographs of the four replicate growth plates (plate examples in Supplementary Fig. 2. The average values of plant size were plotted along with error bars depicting the standard error of the mean. In Supplementary Fig. 4A (Grouped by Lunar Site) n = 4, in Supplementary Fig. 4B (Grouped by Morphology) n = 3.

    "results": "Results and discussion Plant growth in three sources of lunar regolith To provide insights into the potential for using lunar regolith to grow plants as part of the Artemis lunar exploration science program and for future sustained lunar habitation, we developed a small-scale system based on 48-well laboratory plates capable of assessing plant growth in small, obtainable amounts of lunar regolith samples returned from the Apollo missions 11, 12, and 17 (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were sown directly on the surface of the lunar regolith (Fig. 1c), and developing roots grew in full contact throughout the volume of the lunar regolith. 900 mg aliquots of the three different lunar regoliths, as well as the JSC-1A lunar simulant, were arranged in four, 48-well plates (Fig. 1b) modified with a subsurface irrigation system (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). After sowing with Arabidopsis seed (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1H), the plates in their individual watering trays were transferred to clear, ventilated terrarium boxes (Supplementary Fig. 1I), and placed under growth lights in a secured plant growth room. Growing the plants in the ventilated terrarium boxes reduced airflow, yet simulated an open laboratory environment potentially similar to a human-occupied lunar habitat, as opposed to a sterile growth chamber. Germination readily occurred on all samples between 48 and 60 hours after planting, and all lunar seedlings exhibited normal stems and cotyledons (Fig. 2a), indicating that nothing derived from the full contact with the hydrated regolith interfered with the complex set of signaling events required for early aerial development. Between days 6 and 8, each of the plantings was thinned to leave a single plant per well. The roots of the plants thinned from lunar samples were stunted compared to the plants thinned from JSC-1A (Fig. 2b), indicating relative inhibition of root growth in lunar regolith. Aerial growth and development beyond 8 days became slower and more variable in the lunar samples compared to JSC-1A (Fig. 2c). Although there was variability among the individual plant replicates for each of the lunar regolith sites, there were lunar site-specific trends in the development of the plants (Fig. 3a). The rate of development for all plants was monitored daily, and the expansion of the leaf canopy was quantified from top-view photographs (Supplementary Fig. 4). There was almost no variability in the growth rates or morphology among the sixteen JSC-1A replicates (Supplementary Fig. 2). Compared to the JSC-1A replicates, all lunar plants took longer to develop expanded leaves, were smaller in rosette diameter over time, and some were severely stunted and deeply pigmented, a typical indicator of plant stress. Only a few plants developed nearly as well on lunar regolith as those on JSC-1A (Figs. 2b, 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2). The JSC-1A plants maintained a consistently higher rate of growth than plants grown on any of the lunar regolith samples, and the plants grown on Apollo 11 regolith fared worse than plants grown on regolith from Apollo 12 and 17 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 2. Germination and development in the lunar regolith. Open in a new tab a Germination rates were close to 100% in all sources of Apollo lunar regolith and indistinguishable from rates in JSC-1A simulant. Two representative wells for JSC-1A and each Apollo site are shown. b The seedlings thinned from each well on day 6 or 8 indicated that root growth in lunar regolith is not as robust as in JSC-1A. c While germination was uniform among controls and lunar sites, the lunar regolith-grown seedlings did not thrive as compared to the JSC-1A controls. The diameter of the culture plate wells is 12.5 mm (scale bar provided in c). All microscope images in b are shown to the same scale (scale bar shown in the Apollo 17 image).Fig. 3. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in lunar regolith grouped by Apollo site. Open in a new tab a Three (Apollo 11) to four (Apollo 12, 17) plants from each site comprised the analyses.

Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. These associations were primarily derived from the stress transcriptomes and data sets presented in References (37–40) and  gene annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/823555). d 25 of the most highly differentially expressed genes common to all Apollo sites with fold-change presented as Log2. The fully annotated heat map (3 C) is provided as Supplementary Data 1, and the complete, fully annotated list of 3D is provided in Supplementary Data 3). Plant transcriptomes differentiate by Apollo site To examine the potential bases of the stress morphologies of lunar regolith-grown plants, transcriptome analyses were performed on the entire aerial portions (leaves and small stem) of the plants after 20 days. The gene expression data were parsed based on lunar sample site replicates compared to the JSC-1A controls (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 1). The plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith showed the greatest number of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (465), followed by Apollo 12 (265), and Apollo 17 (113) (Fig. 3b). All lunar samples, irrespective of Apollo site, significantly evoked DEGs indicative of a strong stress response, with 71% of the DEGs typically associated with salt, metal, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) stresses35–39 (Fig. 3c). The DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three lunar sites also included a strong representation (29%) of genes associated with nutrient metabolism (Fig. 3d). The most highly repressed and induced (respectively) of the coordinately expressed genes were Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase-A (AT5G54190) and a gene of unknown function (AT5G26270), which are both associated with phosphate starvation40. Other highly induced genes common to all sites included the well-characterized defense genes Nitilase-2 (AT3G44300, also induced by cadmium and metal ions)39, Jasmonate-regulated gene-21 (AT3G55970), and Defensin-like (AT1G13609), plus two genes encoding proteins of unknown function (AT3G28290 and AT3G28300) that are also involved in aluminum toxicity41 and jasmonate signaling42,43. In addition to the coordinate responses, plants from each of the Apollo samples differentially expressed genes unique to each sample location (Fig. 3c), suggesting a discernable and distinguishing plant response based on lunar soil sample; however, all coordinated and site unique categories indicated a stress response by plants to lunar regolith. The statistically supported differentiation of transcriptome responses based on lunar sites indicated that plant responses vary based on the lunar regolith source, and supported the overall conclusion that lunar regolith is more stressful than JSC-1A simulant. However, the various growth morphologies demonstrated within the replicates of each lunar regolith sample suggested the potential for a range of success states for lunar plant growth. To investigate the responses of potential growth success states, the transcriptomic data were regrouped based on plant size as one measure of growth success (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for plant growth data). Plant transcriptomes differentiate by morphology When the gene expression data were parsed with respect to relative growth success, rather than the lunar sample site, even the more successful-looking plants (those individual plants that had a size and morphology similar to those grown in JSC-1A) demonstrated strong stress-response transcriptomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 2). Nine of the lunar plants were organized into three phenotypic groups of three plants each: “Severe” (tiny with distorted morphology and reddish black pigmentation throughout), “Small” (small, but green and well proportioned), and “Large” (large with respect to other regolith-grown plants, and with normal pigmentation and morphology, close to the typical JSC-1A phenotype, but still smaller than JSC-1A-grown plants). Examples of each phenotypic group are shown in Fig. 4a, and the left-hand panel also further illustrates that germination and cotyledon development is identical for JSC-1A and each of the Apollo regoliths (Fig. 3a, 4a–left panel). The quantification of the growth rates within each of these phenotypic categories is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in lunar regolith based on morphology. Open in a new tab a Representative plants from each morphology category: JSC-1A control plants (gray), large lunar plants (blue), small lunar plants (green), and severe plants (yellow). Three replicates of each type comprised each analytical set. b Venn diagrams showing the DEG overlap between each morphology type. c Heat maps show the Log2 fold-change of DEGs from each morphology type. Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. The fully annotated heat map (4 C) is provided as Supplementary Data 2, and an annotated list of the coordinately expressed genes indicated in 4B is provided in Supplementary Data 3).The morphologically normal Small and Large plants demonstrated only 130 and 150 DEGs compared to JSC-1A, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that if plants establish a near-normal developmental trajectory at the early stages of growth, their gene expression patterns approach those of plants in JSC-1A. In contrast, the Severe phenotype plants differentially expressed well over 1000 genes, mostly stress-related, demonstrating a severe reaction to the lunar regoliths (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Data 2). The stochastic differentiation into these morphology groups across the three regolith sources (but not in the JSC-1A materials) suggests that plant success is at least in part driven by unique physical interactions with the lunar substrates, and the efficacious establishment of a strong root zone within the regolith. However, even the most successful lunar regolith-grown plants that overcame some of the initial physical challenges (the Large and Small phenotype categories) demonstrated stress-response transcriptomes (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Data 2). As in the site comparisons (Fig. 3), the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three morphology groups were predominantly associated with ROS, salt, and metal-associated stress, and most (18 of the 25) were also represented in the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in the site-specific comparisons (Figs. 3b–d, Supplementary Data 3). However, there were distinct delineations in the genes uniquely expressed in each morphology group (Fig. 4c). In the more than a thousand DEGs unique to the Severe plants, ROS-associated DEGs predominated, along with hallmarks of additional developmental stress (plant hormones, cell wall remodeling, calcium signaling; Supplementary Data 2). Of the 33 unique DEGs in the Small plants, evidence of ROS signaling also predominated, but genes associated with metal-associated stress were almost absent. In the Large, healthier-looking plants, over 60% of the 63 uniquely induced DEGs were associated with salt and drought stress, with many LEA (late embryogenesis abundant protein) family proteins being between 50 and 100-fold upregulated. The most highly down-regulated unique DEG was ATPC2 (AT1G15700), which is involved in the regulation of ATP synthase activity, which could have a substantial impact on energy metabolism (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 2). The DEGs of the Large, healthier-looking plants likely represent the metabolic challenges that need to be surmounted by plants in the lunar regolith, even if the physical challenges of establishing growth are met. Implications for lunar exploration and habitation These data demonstrated that terrestrial plants are capable of growth in lunar regolith as the primary support matrix. Soils derived from lunar regolith could therefore be used for plant production and experiments on the Moon. However, these data also demonstrated that lunar regolith was not a benign growth substrate. Plants can fail to fully establish in the lunar regolith, resulting in a range of growth states and success. Moreover, plants broadly interpreted lunar soils as highly ionic and as eliciting oxidative stress, which is consonant with the prediction that the cosmic ray and solar wind damage to surface regolith would leave it very reactive to biological systems44. Fe-oxide deposits resulting from the exposure of nanophase iron to atmospheric oxygen could inhibit mineral utilization in the context of regolith8,45, whereas grain size shape and micropores could influence material surface area to foster an elevated release of ions into solution46. An increase in nanophase iron and a decrease in grain size are hallmarks of mature lunar regolith31,47, such as the Apollo 11 regolith used in this study (10084). Although examples of poorly developing plants were represented in each of Apollo site sources, overall, the plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith struggled the most and displayed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes. The plants grown in Apollo 17 regolith struggled the least, and displayed fewer differentially expressed genes. These data suggest that more mature regolith provides a poorer substrate for plant growth than immature regolith. Thus, although this study demonstrates that plants can use lunar regolith as a primary substrate, further characterization and optimization would be required before regolith can be considered a routine in situ resource, particularly in locations where the regolith is highly mature.",

Copyright notice ID: 9098553 PMID: 35552509 Abstract The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations. Subject terms: Abiotic, Transcriptomics, Plant molecular biology Arabidopsis plants were seeded onto lunar soil samples taken directly from the Apollo 11, 12, and 17 missions. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that plants grown in lunar soil differentially express genes associated with salt, metal, and ROS stress.Introduction The return of humans to the Moon during the NASA Artemis program1 has elevated scientific interest in the lunar environment and its impact on terrestrial biology2,3. Since the return to the Moon is envisioned as a dedicated, longer-term commitment to lunar exploration, questions of the lunar environmental impact on biology and biological systems have become a significant part of the lunar exploration agenda. Plants have long been envisioned as part of lunar habitats4–8 and exploration environments9,10. However, until the current study, the interactions between lunar materials and terrestrial biology were unaddressed in the era of modern molecular biology, and there had yet to be any experiments where plants were actually grown in the true lunar regolith. Understanding the impact of sustained exposure of terrestrial biology to lunar regolith, and determining the efficacy of lunar regolith as a viable in situ resource, is important to the concept of returning to the Moon for long durations. Therefore, we used plant growth and gene expression (e.g., 11–13) to both tests the fundamental impact of lunar regolith on terrestrial biology, and provide an initial evaluation of regolith as a matrix for plant growth systems in lunar exploration habitats. Plants are key components of the biological sciences within and in support of space exploration. As model organisms, plants provide insights into gravity, radiation, and other space-related biological phenomena, and therefore help drive an understanding of the physiological adaptation of terrestrial biology to space exploration environments. There is an expanding wealth of literature documenting this progress, e.g., 11,14–19. Plants also make available potentially essential components to the long-term habitation of space and extraterrestrial surfaces by providing food and oxygen, recycling water, and scrubbing carbon dioxide from human habitats. However, many designs of extraterrestrial plant growth systems largely rely on hydroponic systems20,21, in part due to the lack of information on the efficacy of using in situ materials, such as planetary regolith, as a growth substrate. Information on plant growth in lunar regolith, therefore, informs fundamental biology interactions within the lunar environment, and helps scale options for the use of plants in lunar life support scenarios. The Apollo Moon landings were a critical point in the science of space exploration, not only in the accomplishment of lunar visits, but also in that terrestrial biology would be in contact with extraterrestrial material, and samples of that material would be intentionally returned to Earth. The first contact between terrestrial biology and lunar regolith was an unprecedented concern for protecting both the astronauts visiting the Moon as well as the entire Earth biosphere from the potentially harmful effects of returned lunar materials. Novel, extraterrestrial pathogenic microorganisms were the main concern, in addition to toxic mineral compositions and abrasive physical characteristics. To protect the returning human explorers and the terrestrial biosphere, the astronauts and attending medical staff were isolated for 2 weeks upon the return of the early Apollo crews (e.g., 22). In addition, lunar samples were intensively isolated in specialized facilities at the Johnson Space Center Lunar Receiving Laboratory23,24, where the samples were handled in gloveboxes roughly equivalent to current high-level biological containment. The primary goal was to search for pathogens, and those search procedures relied on direct, though largely transient contact between lunar materials and biology. In the specific case of plants, lunar samples were rubbed onto leaf surfaces and sprinkled onto seedlings and growth media25, but plants were never grown in lunar regolith as the support matrix25–27. This gap in knowledge is addressed in the following experiment. We asked the two-tiered question of whether plants can develop successfully in lunar regolith, and if so, what metabolic strategies, as suggested by differential transcriptomes, were utilized to physiologically adapt to growth in this novel environment. Arabidopsis was seeded directly onto samples from Apollo 11 (10084), 12 (12070), and 17 (70051) (Fig. 1a), which represent diverse regolith types. The Apollo 11 and 12 samples are mature and submature regoliths, respectively, due to their relatively long exposure to the lunar surface, whereas the Apollo 17 sample is an immature, shorter surface exposure regolith mixture from multiple areas at the Apollo 17 site28–31. All are from areas of the Moon dominated by basaltic mineralogy28–31. The lunar simulant JSC-1A29,32,33 was used for the terrestrial control material. All lunar regolith samples, as well as the JSC-1A simulant used for controls, were samples sieved to <1 mm particle size. Fig. 1. Lunar regolith sources and experiment set up. Open in a new tab a A summary table of lunar sample sources50. b We used four replicate plates, each 48-well cell culture plate contained four wells of JSC-1A simulant and three of lunar regolith (one well each per plate) – Apollo 11 (A11), Apollo 12 (A12), Apollo 17 (A17). c Each well contained 900 mg of regolith material layered over a 0.45-micron filter and Rockwool wick and was sown with 3-5 Arabidopsis seeds suspended in water (also Supplementary Fig. 1). Lunar In Situ images are publicly available from NASA archives.There area few notable mineralogical and compositional differences between the lunar regoliths and JSC-1A. The lunar samples used here contain 30–52 vol. % agglutinates, which are aggregates containing mineral fragments, nanophase metallic Fe, trapped gases, and glass that form due to micrometeorite impacts28,29. Agglutinate and nanophase Fe abundance both increases with regolith maturity as prolonged surface exposure to the solar wind reduces particle size, the increases the conversion rate of grains of Fe metal to nanophase Fe28,29. Many regolith simulants such as JSC-1A contain abundant natural volcanic glass, e.g., 29, but this material does not fully replicate agglutinate assemblages or morphologies. Additionally, the overall Fe oxidation state of the lunar samples differs from that of JSC-1A. Although to our knowledge, Fe oxidation state ratios have not been quantified in these samples, lunar regolith ubiquitously contains nanophase metallic Fe (partially within agglutinates) in addition to solely Fe2+ in mafic silicates and oxides34, whereas JSC-1A is known to contain Fe3+-bearing Fe-Ti oxides (namely magnetite and chromite) in addition to some proportion of Fe3+ in its silicates and glass. Lastly, two of the lunar regoliths (10084 and 70051) are derived from high-Ti basaltic bedrock and have TiO2 abundances of 5–7 wt.%, which is considerably higher than that of JSC-1A at 1.85 wt.%, e.g., 29.Results and discussion Plant growth in three sources of lunar regolith To provide insights into the potential for using lunar regolith to grow plants as part of the Artemis lunar exploration science program and for future sustained lunar habitation, we developed a small-scale system based on 48-well laboratory plates capable of assessing plant growth in small, obtainable amounts of lunar regolith samples returned from the Apollo missions 11, 12, and 17 (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were sown directly on the surface of the lunar regolith (Fig. 1c), and developing roots grew in full contact throughout the volume of the lunar regolith. 900 mg aliquots of the three different lunar regoliths, as well as the JSC-1A lunar simulant, were arranged in four, 48-well plates (Fig. 1b) modified with a subsurface irrigation system (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). After sowing with Arabidopsis seed (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1H), the plates in their individual watering trays were transferred to clear, ventilated terrarium boxes (Supplementary Fig. 1I), and placed under growth lights in a secured plant growth room. Growing the plants in the ventilated terrarium boxes reduced airflow, yet simulated an open laboratory environment potentially similar to a human-occupied lunar habitat, as opposed to a sterile growth chamber. Germination readily occurred on all samples between 48 and 60 hours after planting, and all lunar seedlings exhibited normal stems and cotyledons (Fig. 2a), indicating that nothing derived from the full contact with the hydrated regolith interfered with the complex set of signaling events required for early aerial development. Between days 6 and 8, each of the plantings was thinned to leave a single plant per well. The roots of the plants thinned from lunar samples were stunted compared to the plants thinned from JSC-1A (Fig. 2b), indicating relative inhibition of root growth in lunar regolith. Aerial growth and development beyond 8 days became slower and more variable in the lunar samples compared to JSC-1A (Fig. 2c). Although there was variability among the individual plant replicates for each of the lunar regolith sites, there were lunar site-specific trends in the development of the plants (Fig. 3a). The rate of development for all plants was monitored daily, and the expansion of the leaf canopy was quantified from top-view photographs (Supplementary Fig. 4). There was almost no variability in the growth rates or morphology among the sixteen JSC-1A replicates (Supplementary Fig. 2). Compared to the JSC-1A replicates, all lunar plants took longer to develop expanded leaves, were smaller in rosette diameter over time, and some were severely stunted and deeply pigmented, a typical indicator of plant stress. Only a few plants developed nearly as well on lunar regolith as those on JSC-1A (Figs. 2b, 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2). The JSC-1A plants maintained a consistently higher rate of growth than plants grown on any of the lunar regolith samples, and the plants grown on Apollo 11 regolith fared worse than plants grown on regolith from Apollo 12 and 17 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 2. Germination and development in the lunar regolith. Open in a new tab a Germination rates were close to 100% in all sources of Apollo lunar regolith and indistinguishable from rates in JSC-1A simulant. Two representative wells for JSC-1A and each Apollo site are shown. b The seedlings thinned from each well on day 6 or 8 indicated that root growth in lunar regolith is not as robust as in JSC-1A. c While germination was uniform among controls and lunar sites, the lunar regolith-grown seedlings did not thrive as compared to the JSC-1A controls. The diameter of the culture plate wells is 12.5 mm (scale bar provided in c). All microscope images in b are shown to the same scale (scale bar shown in the Apollo 17 image).Fig. 3. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in lunar regolith grouped by Apollo site. Open in a new tab a Three (Apollo 11) to four (Apollo 12, 17) plants from each site comprised the analyses. One Apollo 11 plant did not survive and was excluded from the DEG analysis. The photographs were taken just prior to harvest. b Venn diagrams showing the DEG overlap for plants from each site: teal for Apollo 11, blue for Apollo 12, and purple for Apollo 17. c Heat maps show the Log2 fold-change of DEGs in plants from each site. Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. These associations were primarily derived from the stress transcriptomes and data sets presented in References (37–40) and  gene annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/823555). d 25 of the most highly differentially expressed genes common to all Apollo sites with fold-change presented as Log2. The fully annotated heat map (3 C) is provided as Supplementary Data 1, and the complete, fully annotated list of 3D is provided in Supplementary Data 3).Plant transcriptomes differentiate by Apollo site To examine the potential bases of the stress morphologies of lunar regolith-grown plants, transcriptome analyses were performed on the entire aerial portions (leaves and small stem) of the plants after 20 days. The gene expression data were parsed based on lunar sample site replicates compared to the JSC-1A controls (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 1). The plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith showed the greatest number of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (465), followed by Apollo 12 (265), and Apollo 17 (113) (Fig. 3b). All lunar samples, irrespective of Apollo site, significantly evoked DEGs indicative of a strong stress response, with 71% of the DEGs typically associated with salt, metal, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) stresses35–39 (Fig. 3c). The DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three lunar sites also included a strong representation (29%) of genes associated with nutrient metabolism (Fig. 3d). The most highly repressed and induced (respectively) of the coordinately expressed genes were Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase-A (AT5G54190) and a gene of unknown function (AT5G26270), which are both associated with phosphate starvation40. Other highly induced genes common to all sites included the well-characterized defense genes Nitilase-2 (AT3G44300, also induced by cadmium and metal ions)39, Jasmonate-regulated gene-21 (AT3G55970), and Defensin-like (AT1G13609), plus two genes encoding proteins of unknown function (AT3G28290 and AT3G28300) that are also involved in aluminum toxicity41 and jasmonate signaling42,43. In addition to the coordinate responses, plants from each of the Apollo samples differentially expressed genes unique to each sample location (Fig. 3c), suggesting a discernable and distinguishing plant response based on lunar soil sample; however, all coordinated and site unique categories indicated a stress response by plants to lunar regolith. The statistically supported differentiation of transcriptome responses based on lunar sites indicated that plant responses vary based on the lunar regolith source, and supported the overall conclusion that lunar regolith is more stressful than JSC-1A simulant. However, the various growth morphologies demonstrated within the replicates of each lunar regolith sample suggested the potential for a range of success states for lunar plant growth. To investigate the responses of potential growth success states, the transcriptomic data were regrouped based on plant size as one measure of growth success (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for plant growth data).Plant transcriptomes differentiate by morphology When the gene expression data were parsed with respect to relative growth success, rather than the lunar sample site, even the more successful-looking plants (those individual plants that had a size and morphology similar to those grown in JSC-1A) demonstrated strong stress-response transcriptomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 2). Nine of the lunar plants were organized into three phenotypic groups of three plants each: “Severe” (tiny with distorted morphology and reddish black pigmentation throughout), “Small” (small, but green and well proportioned), and “Large” (large with respect to other regolith-grown plants, and with normal pigmentation and morphology, close to the typical JSC-1A phenotype, but still smaller than JSC-1A-grown plants). Examples of each phenotypic group are shown in Fig. 4a, and the left-hand panel also further illustrates that germination and cotyledon development is identical for JSC-1A and each of the Apollo regoliths (Fig. 3a, 4a–left panel). The quantification of the growth rates within each of these phenotypic categories is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in lunar regolith based on morphology. Open in a new tab a Representative plants from each morphology category: JSC-1A control plants (gray), large lunar plants (blue), small lunar plants (green), and severe plants (yellow). Three replicates of each type comprised each analytical set. b Venn diagrams showing the DEG overlap between each morphology type. c Heat maps show the Log2 fold-change of DEGs from each morphology type. Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. The fully annotated heat map (4 C) is provided as Supplementary Data 2, and an annotated list of the coordinately expressed genes indicated in 4B is provided in Supplementary Data 3).The morphologically normal Small and Large plants demonstrated only 130 and 150 DEGs compared to JSC-1A, respectively (Fig. 4b), suggesting that if plants establish a near-normal developmental trajectory at the early stages of growth, their gene expression patterns approach those of plants in JSC-1A. In contrast, the Severe phenotype plants differentially expressed well over 1000 genes, mostly stress-related, demonstrating a severe reaction to the lunar regoliths (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Data 2). The stochastic differentiation into these morphology groups across the three regolith sources (but not in the JSC-1A materials) suggests that plant success is at least in part driven by unique physical interactions with the lunar substrates, and the efficacious establishment of a strong root zone within the regolith. However, even the most successful lunar regolith-grown plants that overcame some of the initial physical challenges (the Large and Small phenotype categories) demonstrated stress-response transcriptomes (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Data 2). As in the site comparisons (Fig. 3), the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three morphology groups were predominantly associated with ROS, salt, and metal-associated stress, and most (18 of the 25) were also represented in the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in the site-specific comparisons (Figs. 3b–d, Supplementary Data 3). However, there were distinct delineations in the genes uniquely expressed in each morphology group (Fig. 4c). In the more than a thousand DEGs unique to the Severe plants, ROS-associated DEGs predominated, along with hallmarks of additional developmental stress (plant hormones, cell wall remodeling, calcium signaling; Supplementary Data 2). Of the 33 unique DEGs in the Small plants, evidence of ROS signaling also predominated, but genes associated with metal-associated stress were almost absent. In the Large, healthier-looking plants, over 60% of the 63 uniquely induced DEGs were associated with salt and drought stress, with many LEA (late embryogenesis abundant protein) family proteins being between 50 and 100-fold upregulated. The most highly down-regulated unique DEG was ATPC2 (AT1G15700), which is involved in the regulation of ATP synthase activity, which could have a substantial impact on energy metabolism (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 2). The DEGs of the Large, healthier-looking plants likely represent the metabolic challenges that need to be surmounted by plants in the lunar regolith, even if the physical challenges of establishing growth are met.Implications for lunar exploration and habitation These data demonstrated that terrestrial plants are capable of growth in lunar regolith as the primary support matrix. Soils derived from lunar regolith could therefore be used for plant production and experiments on the Moon. However, these data also demonstrated that lunar regolith was not a benign growth substrate. Plants can fail to fully establish in the lunar regolith, resulting in a range of growth states and success. Moreover, plants broadly interpreted lunar soils as highly ionic and as eliciting oxidative stress, which is consonant with the prediction that the cosmic ray and solar wind damage to surface regolith would leave it very reactive to biological systems44. Fe-oxide deposits resulting from the exposure of nanophase iron to atmospheric oxygen could inhibit mineral utilization in the context of regolith8,45, whereas grain size shape and micropores could influence material surface area to foster an elevated release of ions into solution46. An increase in nanophase iron and a decrease in grain size are hallmarks of mature lunar regolith31,47, such as the Apollo 11 regolith used in this study (10084). Although examples of poorly developing plants were represented in each of Apollo site sources, overall, the plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith struggled the most and displayed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes. The plants grown in Apollo 17 regolith struggled the least, and displayed fewer differentially expressed genes. These data suggest that more mature regolith provides a poorer substrate for plant growth than immature regolith. Thus, although this study demonstrates that plants can use lunar regolith as a primary substrate, further characterization and optimization would be required before regolith can be considered a routine in situ resource, particularly in locations where the regolith is highly mature.Methods Plant materials All seeds used in the experiment were from the same batch of seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) (TAIR CS70000)48.Lunar regolith materials The lunar Allocation Analysis Review Board/AARB (formerly CAPTEM), through the Apollo Sample Curator at Johnson Space Center (Ryan Ziegler), provided 4 × 1 g samples of regolith from Apollo 11 (10084—2075, 2076, 2077, 2078), Apollo 12 (12070—105, 99,106, 109) and Apollo 17 (70051—159, 160, 161, 162) (Fig. 1a). An example of an Apollo 12 sample before opening is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A. All lunar samples were of particle size <1 mm. These regoliths, along with the NASA lunar simulant JSC-1A (Orbitec JSC-1A Lunar, particle size <1 mm), were used as the substrate for plant growth.Plant growth plate configuration and habitat Plants grew in 900 mg of material; four replicates form each site, alongside 16 replicates of JSC-1A simulant (also 900 mg each). The replicates were arranged in four, 48-well cell culture plates (Nunc 48-well sterile culture plate, cat.# 150687) such that each plate held a replicate of each Apollo site regolith (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig.1B), and four replicates of JSC-1A. Each well is 12.5 mm in diameter and 15 mm deep. The plates were prepared with the following steps: Drainage holes were drilled in a specific configuration to distinguish groups of JSC-1A and lunar samples and then labeled (Plate 1, Plate 2, Plate 3, Plate 4) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The subsurface irrigation system was created by inserting 10 mm × 15 mm cylinders of Rockwool such that a tuft of fibers extends from the bottom of the drainage hole, which compresses the plug to about 7 mm thickness within the well. The plug of Rockwool is topped with a 13 mm circle of a nylon 0.45 μm filter to help prevent regolith from sieving into the plug (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Rockwool is a commercially available (e.g., Grodan®) material composed of spun basalt fibers compressed into formable slabs. The material is chemically and biologically inert, and widely used in plant growth applications; it could conceivably be produced from lunar basalts in situ. The Rockwool plugs in the growth plates were moistened with a nutrient solution of 0.125× strength MS nutrient solution, pH 5.7 (Murashige and Skoog49) by placing the plates in trays of the solution to soak the plugs from below, and then allowed to drain. Next, 900 mg of each regolith sample (or JSC-1A) was added to the designated wells (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and then the plates were returned to trays of nutrient solution to wet the regolith in contact with the Rockwool plug (Supplementary Fig. 1E). The Apollo 17 samples wetted completely through capillary action (as did the JSC-1A controls), however, the Apollo 11 and 12 samples were hydrophobic and initially failed to wet using the subsurface irrigation procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1F). The Apollo 11 and 12 samples were therefore actively stirred with nutrient solution to overcome the hydrophobicity, and once wetted, the samples behaved physically similar to JSC-1A and Apollo 17 (Supplementary Fig. 1G). When all samples were evenly wet with nutrient solution, Arabidopsis Col-0 seeds were distributed with a micro-pipette to the surface of each well (Supplementary Fig. 1H), and then the plates were transferred to vented terrarium chambers (Supplementary Fig. 1I) to reduce airflow yet allow air exchange with the surrounding environment. The growth plates were moistened with nutrient solution daily by placing the plates in trays of solution until the regolith was wetted from below and then allowed to drain. The Rockwool plugs wick liquid very effectively, but also drains readily and does not retain much water. This property of Rockwool helped prevent the regolith from becoming waterlogged. The plates of plants were photographed daily. Between days 6 and 8, the seedlings were thinned to a single plant in each well by drawing out with forceps (Supplementary Fig. 1J). On day 20 the aerial portions of the plants (leaves and hypocotyl) were harvested by cutting at soil-level with scissors to labeled micro-centrifuge tubes (Supplementary Fig. 1J) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80°C until RNA extraction.Calibrations with simulants for experimental design The above approaches and protocols were based on a set of calibration experiments conducted prior to working with lunar materials. Experiments were conducted in the 48-well culture plate form-factor with two JSC planetary simulants (Orbitec JSC-1A Lunar and JSC-Mars-1A) and commercial potting soil. All materials were sized to a collection of particles <1 mm; the JSC materials we obtained pre-sieved to that particle size fraction, and the soil was sieved in the laboratory. The plates were configured as described above with rockwool plugs and filters, and watered from below with a 0.125× MS nutrient solution. The success of this approach informed the lunar materials experiment configuration (Supplementary Fig. 3A). The concentration of the MS nutrient solution was optimized in earlier experiments using 200-well seed starting trays. Serial dilutions of 1× strength MS nutrients were compared to deionized water. A concentration of 0.125× MS supported optimal growth in a JSC-1A substrate. Plants that received water alone in the JSC-1A substrate did not develop past the first set of true leaves (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Since the nutrient composition of JSC-1A is comparable to that of the lunar regolith used in this study50,51 (Supplementary Data 4) it was concluded that supplementary nutrients would be necessary for successful plant growth in lunar regolith as well, but there was insufficient lunar regolith available to test this assumption.RNA isolation and sequencing RNA isolation and sequencing were after the approaches described in Paul et al.15. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines RNA concentration was determined on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). First, 50 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). Then followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First-Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, RRID:SCR_019145). Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, RRID:SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950 Gb) with an average Q30% ≥ 92.5% and Cluster PF = 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2 × 150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 Million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples.RNASeq bioinformatics RNASeq Bioinformatic approaches have been previously described in Paul et al.15. The quality of the RNASeq sequence data was evaluated using FastQC and low-quality bases trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic52,53. STAR Aligner54 was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome, and Gene expression values were calculated using RSEM55. The edgeR linear regression model56 was used to perform the differential gene analysis. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were conducted to evaluate the association of the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of >2, and the average FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn57. Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data were performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/bioinformatics/; RRID:SCR_019120).Statistics and reproducibility The experiment compared plant growth and transcriptomes of JSC-1A lunar simulant to plants grown in regolith from three different Apollo lunar landing sites: Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 17; JSC-1A served as the control, the three Apollo sites were the treatments. The plants were grown in sets on four replicated 48-well growth plates, each composed of four samples of JSC-1A controls (n = 16 total) one representative of each lunar site on each plate (n = 4 total). The individual plate configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1. For the transcriptome analyses, four replicates were used for the control and for each treatment (for JSC-1A, plant #4 from each plate was used) in order to have n = 4 controls for parity to the lunar samples. However one of the replicates in Apollo 11 did not provide viable RNA, and so for the transcriptome analyses of Apollo 11 treatment n = 3, while the Apollo 12 and Apollo 17 treatments n = 4. The statistical methods employed for the transcriptome bioinformatics are described in the Bioinformatics Methods section. The quantitative growth graphs in Supplementary Fig. 4 were derived from the daily photographs of the four replicate growth plates (plate examples in Supplementary Fig. 2. The average values of plant size were plotted along with error bars depicting the standard error of the mean. In Supplementary Fig. 4A (Grouped by Lunar Site) n = 4, in Supplementary Fig. 4B (Grouped by Morphology) n = 3. The numerical values for all points on the Supplementary Fig. 4 graphs are provided in Supplementary Data 5, such that every data point is available.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (1.6MB, pdf) 42003_2022_3334_MOESM2_ESM.pdf (492KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (46.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (66KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (14.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (12.1KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 5 (34.8KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (1.4MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank the members of the UF Space Plants Lab, particularly Jordan Callaham, Natasha Haveman, and Brandon Califar for their support.
