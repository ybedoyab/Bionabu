    "abstract": "Abstract DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Perturbations during gestation in the form of malnutrition, infection, or psychosocial stress have devastating consequences on the physical and mental well-being of offspring. For example, individuals exposed to famine during gestation (such as that of the Dutch Famine of 1944) have significant physical health problems including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure (Painter et al., 2008; Roseboom et al., 2011). Gestational famine exposure also produces long-lasting neurobiological and behavioral consequences, including an increased incidence of schizophrenia (Hoek et al., 1996; Roseboom et al., 2011). Psychosocial stress experienced by the mother during gestation likewise produces vulnerability to psychopathology in offspring, including increased risk for schizophrenia and depression (Betts et al., 2015; Malaspina et al., 2008). Further, work from various animal models provides additional evidence that a suboptimal intrauterine environment has long-term physical and behavioral consequences for offspring (for reviews see (Bock et al., 2015; Driscoll and Barr, 2016; Lupien et al., 2009)). One way that prenatal stress could affect brain function and behavior is through epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. DNA methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups to cytosines, typically at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CG sites), which can dampen transcriptional activity through the blockade of transcription factors or the recruitment of transcriptional silencing machinery. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of active DNA demethylation in regulating transcription within the CNS, and candidates thought to reverse DNA methylation include ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins (Kohli and Zhang, 2013), GADD45b (Ma et al., 2009), and MBD2 (Detich et al., 2002). Though historically associated with early cell development and differentiation, there is now a vast literature showing that DNA methylation/demethylation remains an active process even occurring in mature neurons. Further, studies in humans (Cao-Lei et al., 2014; Kundakovic and Champagne, 2011; Nye et al., 2014) and animal models (Boersma et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015; Jensen Peña et al., 2012; Matrisciano et al., 2013; Morgan and Bale, 2011; Mueller and Bale, 2007, 2008) have highlighted the ability of prenatal stress to alter DNA methylation at various gene loci, including the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. BDNF is crucial for development and plasticity in the developing and adult brain and is implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD (Martinowich et al., 2007). Given the widespread functioning of BDNF across brain regions throughout early development, this locus may play a role in translating prenatal stress to adult phenotypic outcomes including psychopathology. Recent work has also sought to characterize the detrimental impact of early-life stress by examining changes in telomere length –stretches of TTAGGG repeats located on the ends of chromosomes (for a comprehensive review, see (Blaze et al., 2015)). Studies continue to show that various forms of early-life stress (e.g., perinatal complications, psychological stress, physical abuse, etc.) during the prenatal (Entringer et al., 2011; Entringer et al., 2013; Shalev et al., 2014a) or postnatal (Asok et al., 2013; Kananen et al., 2010; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2011; O’Donovan et al., 2011; Tyrka et al., 2010) period shorten telomere length in the periphery. Given that telomeres are dynamically regulated during the first years of life (Slagboom et al., 1994; Zeichner et al., 1999), examining neural changes in telomere length following prenatal stress is another important avenue for understanding how stress experienced in early-life may relate to future mental well-being. In daily life, humans tend to be exposed to unpredictable challenges that vary in magnitude and duration. Studies of prenatal stress in rodents often employ repeated presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, most frequently, immobilization stress (de Souza et al., 2013; Jensen Peña et al., 2012; Matrisciano et al., 2013), a well-known stressor in rodents (Dallman et al., 2004; McEwen and Magarinos, 1997; Paré and Glavin, 1986). Rodent studies however provide evidence for habituation to predictable, non-varying stressors (Armario, 2006; Daviu et al., 2014). In contrast, chronic variable stress in adult males is associated with greater HPA axis responses, including baseline hypersecretion of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin, as well as adrenal hypertrophy (Herman et al., 1995). Repeated exposure of pregnant rats to uncontrollable stress elicited a prolonged (24–48hr) increase in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids from gestational day 4 to 20 (Takahashi et al., 1998), an effect also observed in day 20 fetuses, suggesting that habituation to variable stressors across the rat’s three week pregnancy is minimal. Importantly, as compared to studies employing presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms have reported etiological changes that may be more closely linked to psychiatric disorders (Bock et al., 2015; Mueller and Bale, 2008; Sickmann et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2012). Collectively, these findings suggest that variable, unpredictable stress may model the human condition with greater fidelity than invariant stress paradigms. The current study was designed to characterize changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length across multiple discrete brain regions of the adult rat following unpredictable variable prenatal stress (UVPS). We chose to focus on the mPFC, ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and central/basolateral amygdala, as our prior work showed changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length in these regions in adult animals subjected to adverse caregiving conditions during the first postnatal week (Asok et al., 2014; Blaze et al., 2013; Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014). Changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation have also been found in these same brain regions in other models of prenatal stress (Boersma et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015), and changes at this locus within these same brain regions are known to regulate neural function and behavior including fear conditioning and extinction (Baker-Andresen et al., 2013a; Lubin et al., 2008; Martinowich et al., 2003).",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Subjects Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and their offspring were used (n=6 control animals per sex, 7 UVPS animals per sex derived from 13 dams, with only one male and one female offspring from each control and UVPS litter). To avoid stress associated with shipping during pregnancy, dams were ordered (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) and time-mated in our breeding colony. Pregnancy was determined by daily vaginal lavage with the presence of spermatozoa indicating Gestational day zero (G0). Throughout pregnancy, dams were housed in groups of three in standard maternity cages (47cm × 26cm × 21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12:12 light/dark cycle [0600:1800]; 21 +/− 1° C at 30 – 50% humidity). Rat chow (Purina #5102) and water were available ad libitum. On G21, dams were singly housed. Animal experimentation was conducted in full accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Sciences, copyright 2011). All procedures were approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). 2.2 Unpredictable, Variable Prenatal Stress (UVPS) Paradigm On G0, pregnant dams were randomly assigned to either control or UVPS treatment conditions (Body weight: CNTL, 288 ± 26g; UVPS, 292 ± 23g, ns). Each group was then transported to its own colony room. Beginning on G1, daily stress was applied to UVPS dams only within their own colony room. UVPS dams were exposed during each 24hr period to three stressors, one during each of three discrete time periods varying in duration (Time periods, Early: 0600–1200, Mid: 1200–1800, Late: 1800–600; Duration, 15, 30 or 60 minutes). Stressors included tube restraint (PVC tube, length × diameter: 21.6 × 6.4 cm), high-frequency strobe light (60Hz, 3.5W, 85mA), and white-noise induced stress (80db). Stimulus presentation was block randomized across pregnancy and spanned G1 – G21. Control dams were handled briefly each day to match UVPS handling. To eliminate potential confounds of altered postnatal maternal care by UVPS dams on experimental endpoints, offspring in both conditions were fostered at birth to non-manipulated, newly parturient dams. 2.3 Tissue Collection and Processing On postnatal day (PN) 90, rats were euthanized and flash frozen. Brains were extracted and later sectioned into 300 μm slices on a cryostat. DNA and RNA were simultaneously extracted (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) from homogenized tissue from the mPFC (consisting of infralimbic and prelimbic cortices), dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or central/basolateral amygdala. Tissue was dissected using the following stereotaxic coordinates from bregma (according to (Paxinos and Watson, 2007)): mPFC, +2.52 to +5.16 mm; dorsal hippocampus, −2.16 to −3.36 mm; ventral hippocampus, −4.36 to −6.00 mm; and central/basolateral amygdala, −2.16 to −3.00 mm. Quantity and quality (DNA, 260/280 ratio of ~1.8 [range 1.8–2.0]; RNA, 260/280 ratio of ~2.0 ([ange 2.0–2.1]) of nucleic acids were determined using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000), which were then frozen at −80°C for later processing. 2.4 Bdnf DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Assays For methylation assays, DNA was bisulfite-converted (Epitect Bisulfite Kit, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and direct bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to measure methylation at 11 CG sites in Bdnf exon IV as previously reported (Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014). PCR products were purified (Diffinity Genomics, RapidTip) and sequenced using reverse primers at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute. The electropherogram was read on Chromas software, where the percent methylation of each CG site was determined by the ratio between peak values of G and A (G/[G +A]). We confirmed the accuracy of this technique by assessing methylated standards (Rat Pre-mixed Calibration Standards, Epigendx) ranging from 0–100% methylation and performing a linear regression on methylation values (F1,40=228.9, p<0.001, r2=0.8512). For gene expression assays, RNA was reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and amplified via real-time PCR using Taqman probes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) to target Bdnf IV-containing transcripts (Taqman probe Rn01435337_g1). Tubulin (Taqman probe Rn01484927_m1) was used as a reference gene and all reactions were run in triplicate. The comparative Ct method was used to obtain the relative Bdnf IV mRNA fold change in experimental (UVPS) relative to control animals (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). 2.5 Telomere Length and Telomerase assays DNA was assessed for purity, and diluted to 10ng/uL via Nanodrop spectrophotometry following procedures used previously(Asok et al., 2014). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted with the following primers targeting telomeres (T; ForwardTEL:5′-CGGTTTGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTT-3′ and ReverseTEL:5′-GGCTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCT-3′) and a single copy control gene (S, the angiotensin receptor gene  M86912.1, ForwardAT1: 5′- ACGTGTCTCAGCATCGACCGCTACC-3′ and ReverseAT1: 5′-AGAATGATAAGGAAAGGGAACAAGAAGCCC-3′) (O’Callaghan and Fenech, 2011). Each PCR well contained a final concentration of 1x Power Sybr Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY), 100 nM forward primer, 100 nM reverse primer, and 20ng of sample DNA. The experimenter was blind to a sample’s group identification when loading the PCR plate. For each sample, the telomere and AT1 qPCR assays were carried out in triplicate in the same well position on different 96-well plates. All male and female samples for a particular brain region were run on the same 96-well PCR plate. Given that plates did not contain a standard, we did not statistically contrast brain regions across PCR plates. All samples were assayed in triplicate and any replicate that deviated ± 1 cycle threshold (Ct) beyond the triplicate average (~ 4.3% of all replicates) was excluded from the final Ct average. Eight samples failed to amplify in the amygdala (2 females and 2 males in the control condition and 1 female and 3 males in the UVPS condition) and were thus excluded from analyses. Relative telomere length was calculated as a ratio of telomeres (T) to single copy gene (S) by the formula T/S = (2ΔCt tel)/(2ΔCt AT1). The T/S ratio was then transformed into a proportionate score against the unstressed control condition for each brain region. Similar to Bdnf IV mRNA assays, cDNA was amplified via real-time PCR using Taqman probes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) that targeted telomerase exons 7–9-containing transcripts (Taqman probe Rn01409457_m1). Tubulin was also used as a reference gene and all reactions were run in duplicate. The comparative Ct method was used to obtain the relative mRNA fold change in experimental (UVPS) relative to control animals (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). 2.6 Statistical Analyses Upon assignment to treatment groups, dam body weights were compared using a one-way ANOVA. Following birth, median litter sizes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test. For each brain region, BSP data were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs comparing average methylation (across all 11 sites) between treatment group and sex (2 × 2), as well as two-way ANOVAs on each of the 11 CG sites [treatment group (2) × sex (2)]. Telomere length between conditions and sexes was likewise analyzed with two-way ANOVAs for each brain region. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used when appropriate for post hoc analyses. Differences in Bdnf or telomerase mRNA levels were analyzed by one-sample t-tests (for comparison of UVPS subjects to controls). Differences were considered to be statistically significant for p≤0.05.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Pregnancy Outcome Both UVPS and Control dams gave birth at the expected time, during the period spanning late G21 through early G22. Litter sizes ranged from 11–16 for the UVPS group and 11–17 for the Control group. A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that the median UVPS ranks, Mdn=13.5, were significantly lower than the median Control ranks, Mdn = 15.5 (W=0, p < 0.05). 3.2. Bdnf IV DNA methylation To assess the effects of UVPS on adult DNA methylation patterns, we measured methylation of Bdnf IV in adult (PN90) male and female rats. The primer set we used targeted 3 CG sites that are upstream of the exon start site, encompassing a transcription factor binding site, and 8 CG sites within the beginning of the exon. We targeted this region as there are ample data indicating that this portion of DNA is especially sensitive to a range of physical or psychosocial factors (Kundakovic et al., 2013; Lubin et al., 2008; Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2011). Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) UVPS males had higher levels of methylation in the mPFC (Figure 1A). A two-way ANOVA comparing average methylation values for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=18.19, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher overall methylation than control males (t19=3.512, p=0.01) and UVPS females (t19=3.374, p=0.02). UVPS males also had higher methylation at several individual CG sites. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 1 for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=16.66, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=3.165, p=0.03) and UVPS females (t19=3.552, p=0.01). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 2 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=12.31, p<0.01), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 3 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=16.75, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=2.921, p=0.05) and UVPS females (t19=3.366, p=0.02). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 4 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F1,17=13.75 p<0.01), sex (F1,17=6.453, p=0.02), and an interaction (F1,17=25.35, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t17=6.052, p<0.01), control females (t17=4.325, p<0.01), and UVPS females (t17=5.477, p<0.01). Finally, a two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 7 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=14.38, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=3.452, p=0.02) and UVPS females (t19=3.145, p=0.03). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the medial prefrontal cortex. UVPS male offspring had significantly higher methylation compared to control males and UVPS females across most CG sites within the medial prefrontal cortex. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM.Dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala There were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects for average methylation levels or methylation at individual CG sites within the dorsal or ventral hippocampus or central/basolateral amygdala. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at individual sites within the ventral hippocampus for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction at CG site 1 (F1,22=5.672, p=0.03) and CG site 2 (F1,21=4.935, p=0.04), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance. 3.3. Bdnf IV gene expression As one way to envision the functional relevance of our changes in DNA methylation induced by UVPS within the mPFC, we measured steady-state gene expression of Bdnf IV-containing transcripts. No significant differences in Bdnf IV mRNA levels were detected between UVPS males and controls (t6=1.900, p=0.11) nor UVPS females and controls (t6=1.693, p=0.14). These data however do not necessarily mean our observed methylation changes are not functionally relevant in terms of gene expression. DNA methylation changes do not always result in steady-state changes in gene expression, but can instead prime transcriptional responses to subsequent stimuli and neural activation (Baker-Andresen et al., 2013b). Thus these methylation changes may be functionally relevant in terms of activity-dependent gene expression, which would occur for example when an animal is challenged with a stressor or learning event. 3.4. Telomere length Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomere length UVPS had a significant effect on telomere length in the mPFC (Figure 2). A two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment (UVPS vs. control) on telomere length in the mPFC (F1,22=7.847, p=0.01), with a shorter telomere length present in animals that experienced UVPS. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Telomere length in the adult medial prefrontal cortex. Animals that experienced UVPS had significantly shorter telomeres compared to controls. **p=0.01; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM.Ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala telomere length In the hippocampus and central/basolateral amygdala there were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects on telomere length. 3.5. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomerase mRNA Given the differences observed in telomere length within the mPFC, we also wanted to selectively examine telomerase mRNA in this brain region. No significant differences in telomerase mRNA were detected between UVPS males vs. controls (t6=1.807, p=0.12) or UVPS females compared to control females (t6=2.265, p=0.06).",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Here we used a rodent model of unpredictable, variable prenatal stress to test the hypothesis that a stressful environment in utero can render epigenetic and telomeric changes in the brain of offspring. We observed that Bdnf IV DNA methylation patterns in offspring at age PN90 varied depending on prenatal condition, sex, and brain region. Specifically, males from prenatally stressed mothers had significantly higher levels of methylation in the mPFC compared to male controls and females from prenatally stressed mothers. No differences in Bdnf IV DNA methylation were found in the dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or amygdala in the stressed group compared to controls for either sex. Additionally, brain-region specific stress-induced effects on telomere length were detected with UVPS offspring exhibiting shorter telomeres in the mPFC. While decades of research have shown the detrimental effects of prenatal stress on brain function and behavior, there remains much to elucidate regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. A large drawback of this field as a whole is the variance in prenatal stress paradigms used, which makes direct comparisons between studies difficult (Bock et al., 2015). The timing of gestational stress, predictability of stressor, and the stressors used vary greatly between studies, but are extremely important factors when considering the neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Studying PN21 and PN80 male offspring of pregnant rats subjected to a different variable stress paradigm (beginning on G14, dams were subjected to a mixture of restraint stress, forced swim, cold exposure, social stress, and light exposure overnight) than the one we employed here, another lab found that prenatally stressed males at both ages had higher Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the amygdala and hippocampus (only a site-specific change at PN80) (Boersma et al., 2014). One CG site showed higher methylation within the PFC of prenatally stressed males at PN21, however no methylation differences were detected in the PFC of PN80 offspring (Boersma et al., 2014). Studying PN75 male offspring of pregnant mice subjected to restraint stress under bright light conditions (45 minutes three times per day from G7 through delivery), another lab observed significantly higher levels of methylation (as well as hydroxymethylation) for DNA associated with Bdnf IV in the frontal cortex (Dong et al., 2015). Finally, studying PN90 male and female offspring of pregnant mice exposed to predator stress (from G11–18 dams were daily exposed to three different predator urines), another lab found lower methylation of Bdnf IV DNA (at only one CG site) in the hippocampus of female offspring (St-Cyr and McGowan, 2015). Differences between these studies and ours may be attributable to differences in the type and timing of prenatal stress. Our study is unique in that we employed a block randomized program of three stressors (light, sound, and restraint) presented early- and mid-day during the lights on phase of the cycle and once during the dark phase for varying durations ranging from 15 to 60 minutes for the entire span of gestation. In addition, examining methylation within the entire prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus instead of the specific divisions within could produce different results. Nonetheless, data altogether are consistent with the notion that stress experienced by the dam is able to produce long-term epigenetic changes in offspring at a gene well-linked to neuroplasticity and cognition (e.g.(Bekinschtein et al., 2008; Dincheva et al., 2016; Martinowich et al., 2007; McEwen et al., 2015)) and mental health (e.g.(Fuchikami et al., 2011; Keller et al., 2010; Perroud et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2011)). Our study and that from the McGowan lab shed light on the sex-specific epigenetic changes inducible by intrauterine exposure to stress. Here we also found that prenatally stressed animals exhibited shorter telomeres in the mPFC compared to controls. A number of studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between early-life stress, reduced peripheral telomere length, and future mental-health (Entringer et al., 2011; Marchetto et al., 2016; Shalev et al., 2014b). The effects of stress on telomere length in the brain are less clear (Thomas et al., 2008). Telomeres shorten with age in the cortex of rodents, but this shortening likely reflects changes occurring within glial cells given their increased mitotic potential relative to neurons (Flanary and Streit, 2003; Linkus et al., 2016; Szebeni et al., 2014). We did not distinguish between neurons and glia in measuring telomere length or methylation in the present study, although recent studies from our lab suggest that developmental (postnatal) stress induces changes in mPFC Bdnf IV DNA methylation primarily in neurons (Blaze and Roth, 2017). Rats selectively bred for enhanced depressive-like symptoms (i.e., the Flinders-sensitive line) show reduced telomere length in the hippocampus (Wei et al., 2015) - supporting a role for telomere shortening in the brain. In contrast, other studies have found that postnatal stress (e.g., maternal separation or caregiver maltreatment) is associated with longer telomeres in the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Asok et al., 2014; Botha et al., 2012). The findings here complement our previous work with regard to stress effects on a common brain region (i.e., the mPFC), but differ in the direction of telomere change. Similar to methylation, it is likely that the type (maltreatment vs. maternal separation vs. variable stress) and timing (pre- vs. postnatal) of stress can differentially affect brain telomere length, and future studies are certainly warranted to better understand the parameters affecting brain telomere length. How our telomere data functionally link to our methylation data is not known, but telomerase activity is necessary for the cell survival-promoting effects of BDNF in neurons (Fu et al., 2002). Further evidence of a putative link between BDNF and telomeres is the observation of a reduction in hippocampal telomerase activity, telomere length, and Bdnf expression in a rodent model of depression (Wei et al., 2015). In summary our findings highlight the capacity of in utero stress to leave its epigenetic and telomeric mark within specific regions of the brain, providing important new insights into how gestational stress may have far reaching behavioral consequences for progeny. Indeed, behavioral analysis of the prenatally stressed and non-stressed subjects used in this report revealed robust sex-specific (male-biased) effects on anxiety responses (Ronca, unpublished). These findings are consistent with reports that prenatal stress leads to heightened stress sensitivity, especially among males (Bronson and Bale, 2014), including studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms (Koenig et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2013). In accord with previous research linking prenatal stress with changes in body weight regulation and metabolic disorders (Boersma et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2013), adult body weights of prenatally stressed male (but not female) offspring of the present study were significantly elevated relative to non-stressed offspring (Ronca, unpublished). Our findings indicate that, in addition to brain epigenetic and telomeric changes, unpredictable, variable gestational stress exerts clear sex-specific programming effects on the physical and behavioral health of the offspring. It is unclear whether our data reported here are consistent with the notion that males are more susceptible or females are more resilient to stress, but evidence for sex-based vulnerability and resilience to a variety of stressors continues to grow (Goel et al., 2011; Pfau and Russo, 2015; Radley et al., 2015). The study reported herein provides seminal evidence in a rodent model for an enduring influence of prenatal stress on both brain DNA methylation and telomere length in adulthood. Going forward, the challenge will be to identify the specific role(s) of these molecular brain changes in relation to the diverse effects of early-life stressors. Recent progress characterizing physiological and structural changes in the brain associated with prenatal stress, and their sex-specificity, may provide important new insights. Neuronal changes are highly region-specific with the most dramatic changes occurring in limbic and prefrontal cortical areas, those involved in cognition and emotional behavior. Altered neurogenesis, neuronal density, neuronal arborization, dendritic architecture, synaptic connectivity, and myelination have all been reported in animal models of prenatal stress (Bock et al., 2015; Schuurmans and Kurrasch, 2013; Soztutar et al., 2016). Prenatal stress also disrupts sex-specific maturation of the PFC that normally occurs in adolescence (Markham et al., 2013), thus our results could reflect not only sensitivity of the developing PFC to gestational stress but also a disruption of normative periadolescent maturation. Telomere length may be related to cellular changes in a variety of cell-types throughout the brain, including glia (Dabouras et al., 2004; Leventopoulos et al., 2007). Relating cellular alterations to epigenetic and telomeric changes in specific brain regions (including those epigenetic and telomeric observations reported here, and of course other presumed concomitant changes) are certain to produce a deeper understanding of the far-reaching effects of prenatal stress. While extensive progress has been made in the understanding of the role of early-life adversity in the development of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, more detailed research on sex-specific, epigenetic, brain structural and behavioral changes is warranted. In particular, consistency across gestational stress paradigms, including the predictability and timing of stressor, the use of common behavioral and endpoint measures, and comparisons between male and females are vital for uncovering consistent and meaningful patterns of neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Our present findings may have relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to early developmental programming, intergenerational epigenetic transmission of environmental exposures, and telomere biology. Illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying multigenerational programming of stress responses and mental and physical health outcomes are important first steps toward establishing therapeutic interventions to halt the generational persistence of pathological outcomes associated with early life adversity.",

Copyright notice ID: 5600826 MSID: MS873339 PMID: 28330827 The publisher's version of this article is available at Int J Dev Neurosci Abstract DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes. Keywords: prenatal stress, maternal stress, DNA methylation, telomere length1. Introduction Perturbations during gestation in the form of malnutrition, infection, or psychosocial stress have devastating consequences on the physical and mental well-being of offspring. For example, individuals exposed to famine during gestation (such as that of the Dutch Famine of 1944) have significant physical health problems including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure (Painter et al., 2008; Roseboom et al., 2011). Gestational famine exposure also produces long-lasting neurobiological and behavioral consequences, including an increased incidence of schizophrenia (Hoek et al., 1996; Roseboom et al., 2011). Psychosocial stress experienced by the mother during gestation likewise produces vulnerability to psychopathology in offspring, including increased risk for schizophrenia and depression (Betts et al., 2015; Malaspina et al., 2008). Further, work from various animal models provides additional evidence that a suboptimal intrauterine environment has long-term physical and behavioral consequences for offspring (for reviews see (Bock et al., 2015; Driscoll and Barr, 2016; Lupien et al., 2009)). One way that prenatal stress could affect brain function and behavior is through epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. DNA methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups to cytosines, typically at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CG sites), which can dampen transcriptional activity through the blockade of transcription factors or the recruitment of transcriptional silencing machinery. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of active DNA demethylation in regulating transcription within the CNS, and candidates thought to reverse DNA methylation include ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins (Kohli and Zhang, 2013), GADD45b (Ma et al., 2009), and MBD2 (Detich et al., 2002). Though historically associated with early cell development and differentiation, there is now a vast literature showing that DNA methylation/demethylation remains an active process even occurring in mature neurons. Further, studies in humans (Cao-Lei et al., 2014; Kundakovic and Champagne, 2011; Nye et al., 2014) and animal models (Boersma et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015; Jensen Peña et al., 2012; Matrisciano et al., 2013; Morgan and Bale, 2011; Mueller and Bale, 2007, 2008) have highlighted the ability of prenatal stress to alter DNA methylation at various gene loci, including the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. BDNF is crucial for development and plasticity in the developing and adult brain and is implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD (Martinowich et al., 2007). Given the widespread functioning of BDNF across brain regions throughout early development, this locus may play a role in translating prenatal stress to adult phenotypic outcomes including psychopathology. Recent work has also sought to characterize the detrimental impact of early-life stress by examining changes in telomere length –stretches of TTAGGG repeats located on the ends of chromosomes (for a comprehensive review, see (Blaze et al., 2015)). Studies continue to show that various forms of early-life stress (e.g., perinatal complications, psychological stress, physical abuse, etc.) during the prenatal (Entringer et al., 2011; Entringer et al., 2013; Shalev et al., 2014a) or postnatal (Asok et al., 2013; Kananen et al., 2010; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2011; O’Donovan et al., 2011; Tyrka et al., 2010) period shorten telomere length in the periphery. Given that telomeres are dynamically regulated during the first years of life (Slagboom et al., 1994; Zeichner et al., 1999), examining neural changes in telomere length following prenatal stress is another important avenue for understanding how stress experienced in early-life may relate to future mental well-being. In daily life, humans tend to be exposed to unpredictable challenges that vary in magnitude and duration. Studies of prenatal stress in rodents often employ repeated presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, most frequently, immobilization stress (de Souza et al., 2013; Jensen Peña et al., 2012; Matrisciano et al., 2013), a well-known stressor in rodents (Dallman et al., 2004; McEwen and Magarinos, 1997; Paré and Glavin, 1986). Rodent studies however provide evidence for habituation to predictable, non-varying stressors (Armario, 2006; Daviu et al., 2014). In contrast, chronic variable stress in adult males is associated with greater HPA axis responses, including baseline hypersecretion of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin, as well as adrenal hypertrophy (Herman et al., 1995). Repeated exposure of pregnant rats to uncontrollable stress elicited a prolonged (24–48hr) increase in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids from gestational day 4 to 20 (Takahashi et al., 1998), an effect also observed in day 20 fetuses, suggesting that habituation to variable stressors across the rat’s three week pregnancy is minimal. Importantly, as compared to studies employing presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms have reported etiological changes that may be more closely linked to psychiatric disorders (Bock et al., 2015; Mueller and Bale, 2008; Sickmann et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2012). Collectively, these findings suggest that variable, unpredictable stress may model the human condition with greater fidelity than invariant stress paradigms. The current study was designed to characterize changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length across multiple discrete brain regions of the adult rat following unpredictable variable prenatal stress (UVPS). We chose to focus on the mPFC, ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and central/basolateral amygdala, as our prior work showed changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length in these regions in adult animals subjected to adverse caregiving conditions during the first postnatal week (Asok et al., 2014; Blaze et al., 2013; Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014). Changes in Bdnf IV DNA methylation have also been found in these same brain regions in other models of prenatal stress (Boersma et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015), and changes at this locus within these same brain regions are known to regulate neural function and behavior including fear conditioning and extinction (Baker-Andresen et al., 2013a; Lubin et al., 2008; Martinowich et al., 2003).2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Subjects Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and their offspring were used (n=6 control animals per sex, 7 UVPS animals per sex derived from 13 dams, with only one male and one female offspring from each control and UVPS litter). To avoid stress associated with shipping during pregnancy, dams were ordered (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) and time-mated in our breeding colony. Pregnancy was determined by daily vaginal lavage with the presence of spermatozoa indicating Gestational day zero (G0). Throughout pregnancy, dams were housed in groups of three in standard maternity cages (47cm × 26cm × 21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12:12 light/dark cycle [0600:1800]; 21 +/− 1° C at 30 – 50% humidity). Rat chow (Purina #5102) and water were available ad libitum. On G21, dams were singly housed. Animal experimentation was conducted in full accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Sciences, copyright 2011). All procedures were approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).2.2 Unpredictable, Variable Prenatal Stress (UVPS) Paradigm On G0, pregnant dams were randomly assigned to either control or UVPS treatment conditions (Body weight: CNTL, 288 ± 26g; UVPS, 292 ± 23g, ns). Each group was then transported to its own colony room. Beginning on G1, daily stress was applied to UVPS dams only within their own colony room. UVPS dams were exposed during each 24hr period to three stressors, one during each of three discrete time periods varying in duration (Time periods, Early: 0600–1200, Mid: 1200–1800, Late: 1800–600; Duration, 15, 30 or 60 minutes). Stressors included tube restraint (PVC tube, length × diameter: 21.6 × 6.4 cm), high-frequency strobe light (60Hz, 3.5W, 85mA), and white-noise induced stress (80db). Stimulus presentation was block randomized across pregnancy and spanned G1 – G21. Control dams were handled briefly each day to match UVPS handling. To eliminate potential confounds of altered postnatal maternal care by UVPS dams on experimental endpoints, offspring in both conditions were fostered at birth to non-manipulated, newly parturient dams.2.3 Tissue Collection and Processing On postnatal day (PN) 90, rats were euthanized and flash frozen. Brains were extracted and later sectioned into 300 μm slices on a cryostat. DNA and RNA were simultaneously extracted (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) from homogenized tissue from the mPFC (consisting of infralimbic and prelimbic cortices), dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or central/basolateral amygdala. Tissue was dissected using the following stereotaxic coordinates from bregma (according to (Paxinos and Watson, 2007)): mPFC, +2.52 to +5.16 mm; dorsal hippocampus, −2.16 to −3.36 mm; ventral hippocampus, −4.36 to −6.00 mm; and central/basolateral amygdala, −2.16 to −3.00 mm. Quantity and quality (DNA, 260/280 ratio of ~1.8 [range 1.8–2.0]; RNA, 260/280 ratio of ~2.0 ([ange 2.0–2.1]) of nucleic acids were determined using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000), which were then frozen at −80°C for later processing.2.4 Bdnf DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Assays For methylation assays, DNA was bisulfite-converted (Epitect Bisulfite Kit, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and direct bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to measure methylation at 11 CG sites in Bdnf exon IV as previously reported (Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014). PCR products were purified (Diffinity Genomics, RapidTip) and sequenced using reverse primers at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute. The electropherogram was read on Chromas software, where the percent methylation of each CG site was determined by the ratio between peak values of G and A (G/[G +A]). We confirmed the accuracy of this technique by assessing methylated standards (Rat Pre-mixed Calibration Standards, Epigendx) ranging from 0–100% methylation and performing a linear regression on methylation values (F1,40=228.9, p<0.001, r2=0.8512). For gene expression assays, RNA was reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and amplified via real-time PCR using Taqman probes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) to target Bdnf IV-containing transcripts (Taqman probe Rn01435337_g1). Tubulin (Taqman probe Rn01484927_m1) was used as a reference gene and all reactions were run in triplicate. The comparative Ct method was used to obtain the relative Bdnf IV mRNA fold change in experimental (UVPS) relative to control animals (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).2.5 Telomere Length and Telomerase assays DNA was assessed for purity, and diluted to 10ng/uL via Nanodrop spectrophotometry following procedures used previously(Asok et al., 2014). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted with the following primers targeting telomeres (T; ForwardTEL:5′-CGGTTTGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTT-3′ and ReverseTEL:5′-GGCTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCT-3′) and a single copy control gene (S, the angiotensin receptor gene  M86912.1, ForwardAT1: 5′- ACGTGTCTCAGCATCGACCGCTACC-3′ and ReverseAT1: 5′-AGAATGATAAGGAAAGGGAACAAGAAGCCC-3′) (O’Callaghan and Fenech, 2011). Each PCR well contained a final concentration of 1x Power Sybr Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY), 100 nM forward primer, 100 nM reverse primer, and 20ng of sample DNA. The experimenter was blind to a sample’s group identification when loading the PCR plate. For each sample, the telomere and AT1 qPCR assays were carried out in triplicate in the same well position on different 96-well plates. All male and female samples for a particular brain region were run on the same 96-well PCR plate. Given that plates did not contain a standard, we did not statistically contrast brain regions across PCR plates. All samples were assayed in triplicate and any replicate that deviated ± 1 cycle threshold (Ct) beyond the triplicate average (~ 4.3% of all replicates) was excluded from the final Ct average. Eight samples failed to amplify in the amygdala (2 females and 2 males in the control condition and 1 female and 3 males in the UVPS condition) and were thus excluded from analyses. Relative telomere length was calculated as a ratio of telomeres (T) to single copy gene (S) by the formula T/S = (2ΔCt tel)/(2ΔCt AT1). The T/S ratio was then transformed into a proportionate score against the unstressed control condition for each brain region. Similar to Bdnf IV mRNA assays, cDNA was amplified via real-time PCR using Taqman probes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) that targeted telomerase exons 7–9-containing transcripts (Taqman probe Rn01409457_m1). Tubulin was also used as a reference gene and all reactions were run in duplicate. The comparative Ct method was used to obtain the relative mRNA fold change in experimental (UVPS) relative to control animals (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).2.6 Statistical Analyses Upon assignment to treatment groups, dam body weights were compared using a one-way ANOVA. Following birth, median litter sizes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test. For each brain region, BSP data were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs comparing average methylation (across all 11 sites) between treatment group and sex (2 × 2), as well as two-way ANOVAs on each of the 11 CG sites [treatment group (2) × sex (2)]. Telomere length between conditions and sexes was likewise analyzed with two-way ANOVAs for each brain region. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used when appropriate for post hoc analyses. Differences in Bdnf or telomerase mRNA levels were analyzed by one-sample t-tests (for comparison of UVPS subjects to controls). Differences were considered to be statistically significant for p≤0.05.3. Results 3.1. Pregnancy Outcome Both UVPS and Control dams gave birth at the expected time, during the period spanning late G21 through early G22. Litter sizes ranged from 11–16 for the UVPS group and 11–17 for the Control group. A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that the median UVPS ranks, Mdn=13.5, were significantly lower than the median Control ranks, Mdn = 15.5 (W=0, p < 0.05).3.2. Bdnf IV DNA methylation To assess the effects of UVPS on adult DNA methylation patterns, we measured methylation of Bdnf IV in adult (PN90) male and female rats. The primer set we used targeted 3 CG sites that are upstream of the exon start site, encompassing a transcription factor binding site, and 8 CG sites within the beginning of the exon. We targeted this region as there are ample data indicating that this portion of DNA is especially sensitive to a range of physical or psychosocial factors (Kundakovic et al., 2013; Lubin et al., 2008; Roth et al., 2009; Roth et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2011). Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) UVPS males had higher levels of methylation in the mPFC (Figure 1A). A two-way ANOVA comparing average methylation values for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=18.19, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher overall methylation than control males (t19=3.512, p=0.01) and UVPS females (t19=3.374, p=0.02). UVPS males also had higher methylation at several individual CG sites. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 1 for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=16.66, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=3.165, p=0.03) and UVPS females (t19=3.552, p=0.01). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 2 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=12.31, p<0.01), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 3 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=16.75, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=2.921, p=0.05) and UVPS females (t19=3.366, p=0.02). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 4 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F1,17=13.75 p<0.01), sex (F1,17=6.453, p=0.02), and an interaction (F1,17=25.35, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t17=6.052, p<0.01), control females (t17=4.325, p<0.01), and UVPS females (t17=5.477, p<0.01). Finally, a two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 7 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F1,19=14.38, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t19=3.452, p=0.02) and UVPS females (t19=3.145, p=0.03). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the medial prefrontal cortex. UVPS male offspring had significantly higher methylation compared to control males and UVPS females across most CG sites within the medial prefrontal cortex. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM.Dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala There were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects for average methylation levels or methylation at individual CG sites within the dorsal or ventral hippocampus or central/basolateral amygdala. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at individual sites within the ventral hippocampus for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction at CG site 1 (F1,22=5.672, p=0.03) and CG site 2 (F1,21=4.935, p=0.04), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance.3.3. Bdnf IV gene expression As one way to envision the functional relevance of our changes in DNA methylation induced by UVPS within the mPFC, we measured steady-state gene expression of Bdnf IV-containing transcripts. No significant differences in Bdnf IV mRNA levels were detected between UVPS males and controls (t6=1.900, p=0.11) nor UVPS females and controls (t6=1.693, p=0.14). These data however do not necessarily mean our observed methylation changes are not functionally relevant in terms of gene expression. DNA methylation changes do not always result in steady-state changes in gene expression, but can instead prime transcriptional responses to subsequent stimuli and neural activation (Baker-Andresen et al., 2013b). Thus these methylation changes may be functionally relevant in terms of activity-dependent gene expression, which would occur for example when an animal is challenged with a stressor or learning event.3.4. Telomere length Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomere length UVPS had a significant effect on telomere length in the mPFC (Figure 2). A two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment (UVPS vs. control) on telomere length in the mPFC (F1,22=7.847, p=0.01), with a shorter telomere length present in animals that experienced UVPS. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Telomere length in the adult medial prefrontal cortex. Animals that experienced UVPS had significantly shorter telomeres compared to controls. **p=0.01; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM.Ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala telomere length In the hippocampus and central/basolateral amygdala there were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects on telomere length.3.5. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomerase mRNA Given the differences observed in telomere length within the mPFC, we also wanted to selectively examine telomerase mRNA in this brain region. No significant differences in telomerase mRNA were detected between UVPS males vs. controls (t6=1.807, p=0.12) or UVPS females compared to control females (t6=2.265, p=0.06).4. Discussion Here we used a rodent model of unpredictable, variable prenatal stress to test the hypothesis that a stressful environment in utero can render epigenetic and telomeric changes in the brain of offspring. We observed that Bdnf IV DNA methylation patterns in offspring at age PN90 varied depending on prenatal condition, sex, and brain region. Specifically, males from prenatally stressed mothers had significantly higher levels of methylation in the mPFC compared to male controls and females from prenatally stressed mothers. No differences in Bdnf IV DNA methylation were found in the dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or amygdala in the stressed group compared to controls for either sex. Additionally, brain-region specific stress-induced effects on telomere length were detected with UVPS offspring exhibiting shorter telomeres in the mPFC. While decades of research have shown the detrimental effects of prenatal stress on brain function and behavior, there remains much to elucidate regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. A large drawback of this field as a whole is the variance in prenatal stress paradigms used, which makes direct comparisons between studies difficult (Bock et al., 2015). The timing of gestational stress, predictability of stressor, and the stressors used vary greatly between studies, but are extremely important factors when considering the neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Studying PN21 and PN80 male offspring of pregnant rats subjected to a different variable stress paradigm (beginning on G14, dams were subjected to a mixture of restraint stress, forced swim, cold exposure, social stress, and light exposure overnight) than the one we employed here, another lab found that prenatally stressed males at both ages had higher Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the amygdala and hippocampus (only a site-specific change at PN80) (Boersma et al., 2014). One CG site showed higher methylation within the PFC of prenatally stressed males at PN21, however no methylation differences were detected in the PFC of PN80 offspring (Boersma et al., 2014). Studying PN75 male offspring of pregnant mice subjected to restraint stress under bright light conditions (45 minutes three times per day from G7 through delivery), another lab observed significantly higher levels of methylation (as well as hydroxymethylation) for DNA associated with Bdnf IV in the frontal cortex (Dong et al., 2015). Finally, studying PN90 male and female offspring of pregnant mice exposed to predator stress (from G11–18 dams were daily exposed to three different predator urines), another lab found lower methylation of Bdnf IV DNA (at only one CG site) in the hippocampus of female offspring (St-Cyr and McGowan, 2015). Differences between these studies and ours may be attributable to differences in the type and timing of prenatal stress. Our study is unique in that we employed a block randomized program of three stressors (light, sound, and restraint) presented early- and mid-day during the lights on phase of the cycle and once during the dark phase for varying durations ranging from 15 to 60 minutes for the entire span of gestation. In addition, examining methylation within the entire prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus instead of the specific divisions within could produce different results. Nonetheless, data altogether are consistent with the notion that stress experienced by the dam is able to produce long-term epigenetic changes in offspring at a gene well-linked to neuroplasticity and cognition (e.g.(Bekinschtein et al., 2008; Dincheva et al., 2016; Martinowich et al., 2007; McEwen et al., 2015)) and mental health (e.g.(Fuchikami et al., 2011; Keller et al., 2010; Perroud et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2011)). Our study and that from the McGowan lab shed light on the sex-specific epigenetic changes inducible by intrauterine exposure to stress. Here we also found that prenatally stressed animals exhibited shorter telomeres in the mPFC compared to controls. A number of studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between early-life stress, reduced peripheral telomere length, and future mental-health (Entringer et al., 2011; Marchetto et al., 2016; Shalev et al., 2014b). The effects of stress on telomere length in the brain are less clear (Thomas et al., 2008). Telomeres shorten with age in the cortex of rodents, but this shortening likely reflects changes occurring within glial cells given their increased mitotic potential relative to neurons (Flanary and Streit, 2003; Linkus et al., 2016; Szebeni et al., 2014). We did not distinguish between neurons and glia in measuring telomere length or methylation in the present study, although recent studies from our lab suggest that developmental (postnatal) stress induces changes in mPFC Bdnf IV DNA methylation primarily in neurons (Blaze and Roth, 2017). Rats selectively bred for enhanced depressive-like symptoms (i.e., the Flinders-sensitive line) show reduced telomere length in the hippocampus (Wei et al., 2015) - supporting a role for telomere shortening in the brain. In contrast, other studies have found that postnatal stress (e.g., maternal separation or caregiver maltreatment) is associated with longer telomeres in the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Asok et al., 2014; Botha et al., 2012). The findings here complement our previous work with regard to stress effects on a common brain region (i.e., the mPFC), but differ in the direction of telomere change. Similar to methylation, it is likely that the type (maltreatment vs. maternal separation vs. variable stress) and timing (pre- vs. postnatal) of stress can differentially affect brain telomere length, and future studies are certainly warranted to better understand the parameters affecting brain telomere length. How our telomere data functionally link to our methylation data is not known, but telomerase activity is necessary for the cell survival-promoting effects of BDNF in neurons (Fu et al., 2002). Further evidence of a putative link between BDNF and telomeres is the observation of a reduction in hippocampal telomerase activity, telomere length, and Bdnf expression in a rodent model of depression (Wei et al., 2015). In summary our findings highlight the capacity of in utero stress to leave its epigenetic and telomeric mark within specific regions of the brain, providing important new insights into how gestational stress may have far reaching behavioral consequences for progeny. Indeed, behavioral analysis of the prenatally stressed and non-stressed subjects used in this report revealed robust sex-specific (male-biased) effects on anxiety responses (Ronca, unpublished). These findings are consistent with reports that prenatal stress leads to heightened stress sensitivity, especially among males (Bronson and Bale, 2014), including studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms (Koenig et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2013). In accord with previous research linking prenatal stress with changes in body weight regulation and metabolic disorders (Boersma et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2013), adult body weights of prenatally stressed male (but not female) offspring of the present study were significantly elevated relative to non-stressed offspring (Ronca, unpublished). Our findings indicate that, in addition to brain epigenetic and telomeric changes, unpredictable, variable gestational stress exerts clear sex-specific programming effects on the physical and behavioral health of the offspring. It is unclear whether our data reported here are consistent with the notion that males are more susceptible or females are more resilient to stress, but evidence for sex-based vulnerability and resilience to a variety of stressors continues to grow (Goel et al., 2011; Pfau and Russo, 2015; Radley et al., 2015). The study reported herein provides seminal evidence in a rodent model for an enduring influence of prenatal stress on both brain DNA methylation and telomere length in adulthood. Going forward, the challenge will be to identify the specific role(s) of these molecular brain changes in relation to the diverse effects of early-life stressors. Recent progress characterizing physiological and structural changes in the brain associated with prenatal stress, and their sex-specificity, may provide important new insights. Neuronal changes are highly region-specific with the most dramatic changes occurring in limbic and prefrontal cortical areas, those involved in cognition and emotional behavior. Altered neurogenesis, neuronal density, neuronal arborization, dendritic architecture, synaptic connectivity, and myelination have all been reported in animal models of prenatal stress (Bock et al., 2015; Schuurmans and Kurrasch, 2013; Soztutar et al., 2016). Prenatal stress also disrupts sex-specific maturation of the PFC that normally occurs in adolescence (Markham et al., 2013), thus our results could reflect not only sensitivity of the developing PFC to gestational stress but also a disruption of normative periadolescent maturation. Telomere length may be related to cellular changes in a variety of cell-types throughout the brain, including glia (Dabouras et al., 2004; Leventopoulos et al., 2007). Relating cellular alterations to epigenetic and telomeric changes in specific brain regions (including those epigenetic and telomeric observations reported here, and of course other presumed concomitant changes) are certain to produce a deeper understanding of the far-reaching effects of prenatal stress. While extensive progress has been made in the understanding of the role of early-life adversity in the development of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, more detailed research on sex-specific, epigenetic, brain structural and behavioral changes is warranted. In particular, consistency across gestational stress paradigms, including the predictability and timing of stressor, the use of common behavioral and endpoint measures, and comparisons between male and females are vital for uncovering consistent and meaningful patterns of neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Our present findings may have relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to early developmental programming, intergenerational epigenetic transmission of environmental exposures, and telomere biology. Illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying multigenerational programming of stress responses and mental and physical health outcomes are important first steps toward establishing therapeutic interventions to halt the generational persistence of pathological outcomes associated with early life adversity.Acknowledgments This research was supported by NIGMS (1P20GM103653) and private donation funds to TLR and NICHD (1R01HD50201) and funds from NASA Space Biology Program to AER.

    "abstract": "Abstract Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.1, 2, 3 To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station (ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (∼2 ​h /day) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.4 Additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to muscle health. One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is 50% male and 50% female.5 Additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel. Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.6 Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.7 Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8 In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.9,10 These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.9,10 Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11 However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12 One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts. The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0–14 days of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps. Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Animal experiments Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020). The overall protocol (including pictorial description) for this study has been previously reported.15 Briefly, 120 male (M) and female (F) Fisher rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, Stock number: 002). At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks to recover; thereafter, they were divided into either simulated micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight, Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated 0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals’ hips to keep hindlimbs suspended from the ground, as we have previously described.16,17 Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced loading, as we have previously described.16,17 Partial weight-bearing was assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing. A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in interventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30%–70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute. Death was confirmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected and weighed. Soleus muscles were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 ​h and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis. Gonadectomy status and associated alterations are detailed in our previous manuscript using these animals.15 Animal housing: Conditions for housing has been published previously.15 Briefly, all animals were singly housed in custom-made cages specifically designed for micro-gravity or partial weight-bearing interventions. Animals were kept in the BIDMC animal facility at ∼22 ​°C with a 12:12 light cycle. Animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum throughout the study. Rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress (> 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.), it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss. Grip Strength: Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described.15 Briefly, animals’ hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA). Animals were gently pulled from the bar until they released their grip; the corresponding force was recorded. Animals repeated this measurement two more times; the greatest value was utilized for data analysis. Maximally stimulated muscle strength: Maximal stimulation of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion muscles was completed as previously described.15 Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen using a vaporizing system. The animal's left foot was then taped to a footplate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and adjusted to ensure ∼90% of dorsiflexion at the ankle joint and alignment of the ankle and knee joints. The animal's tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. To confirm appropriate needle placement, a small (10 ​Hz) stimulation was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was confirmed, a 200 ​Hz stimulation for 200 ​ms was applied to the nerve generating a maximal tetanus. Maximal tetanic measurements were visually inspected by a researcher to ensure maximal tetanus was achieved. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT): Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, Stratee, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany) was utilized to quantify total muscle cross-sectional area in the tibial compartment, as previously described.15 Anesthetized animals (∼2% isoflurane) were positioned and images were captured 40 ​mm from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition parameters: voxel size: 0.10 ​mm, Ct speed: 10 ​mm/s. Images were analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area with specified software provided by the manufacturer. Histology: Histological preparation and analysis was completed as we have previously described.8 After 48 ​h of fixation in 10% formalin and washing with PBS, soleus muscles were embedded in paraffin and stained for myosin heavy chain type I (ab11083; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), myosin heavy chain type II (ab91506; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize muscle fiber borders (W6748; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were collected with an epifluorescent microscope at 20 × magnification (Zeiss Axio Imager M1) and analyzed with Fiji (ImageJ, ) as we have previously described.8 All analyses were completed by a blinded investigator (DS). Statistical Analysis: Longitudinal data were analyzed as percent difference between baseline and post-intervention values with a covariate of baseline values. Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible influence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent differences were used to more directly compare data between males and females despite their significant differences in bodyweight and other muscle parameters. The specific research question was to evaluate differences between males and females at different simulated gravitational loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or OVX/CAST). Therefore, we developed a novel statistical model in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software using the least squared means estimate (LSMESTIMATE) statement within the procedure mixed (PROC MIXED) function. Primary comparisons of interest included: •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0g •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0.4g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0.4g These four primary comparisons were condensed into a priori contrasts and were tested globally with a joint F-test, as we have previously described.15 If the joint F-test was significant (p ​< ​0.05), individual contrasts were evaluated for differences between pre-planned comparisons. The p-values for specific contrasts were accommodated for multiple comparisons with a Holm's adjustment (p ​< ​0.05). Additionally, within each sex and hormonal status, an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of loading (1g, 0.4g, and 0g) was completed as a model validation. Significance was denoted with a global F-test of p ​< ​0.05 and pair-wise comparisons were investigated with a Tukey-adjusted p-value (p ​< ​0.05). Graphical representation of model validation analysis can be found in supplementary materials.18 All data analysis was completed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). All SAS coding (including datasets), SAS outputs, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available in Supplementary Files.18",

Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g (Fig. 1A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (+14.9% v. −6.8% respectively, Fig. 1B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (−9.4% v. −0.90%, Fig. 1C) and OVX/CAST conditions (−11.4% v. −3.9%, Fig. 1D). Fig. 1.

In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less loss in grip strength compared to males (−45.3% v. −67.9% respectively, Fig. 1F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in SHAM (Fig. 1G) or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 1H). 3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-sectional area compared to males In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g, females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at 0g: −9.2% v. −4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2A; OVX/CAST at 0g: −11.7% v. 0.91% Fig. 2B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2C; OVX/CAST at 0.4g: −10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.With regards to total muscle cross-sectional area loss of the lower leg, there were no differences between SHAM females and males at 0g (Fig. 2E). In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not significant (−19.3% v. −9.8% respectively, Fig. 2F). The same findings were observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (−17.9% v. −8.8%, Fig. 2G). However, in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (−16.8% v. −3.8% respectively, Fig. 2H). 3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as males at 0g but greater muscle fiber area loss than males at 0.4g In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 ​g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber area (Fig. 3A–B). However, at 0.4 ​g in SHAM and OVX/CAST animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males (−34.8% v. −15.1% respectively, Fig. 3C). Moreover, this relationship was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (−29.8% v. −15.0% respectively, Fig. 3D). Fig. 3.

Individual data points are percent difference from within sex and hormone-status 1g (fully loaded) control animals. Data are presented as Mean ​± ​SEM. SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.In myosin heavy chain type I-positive fibers (hereafter referred to as type I fibers), there was no difference between SHAM females and males after 0g intervention (Fig. 3E), nor within OVX/CAST rats (Fig. 3F). After 0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I fiber area loss compared to males (−34.7% v. −12.4% respectively, Fig. 3G and −28.3% v. −13.9% respectively, Fig. 3H). At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II) fibers between females and males (Fig. 3I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II fibers (Fig. 3K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences in type II fiber area, though this did not reach significance (−35.3% v. −17.1%, Fig. 3L). In muscle fibers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 ​g (Fig. 3M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males (−46.7% v. −29.1% respectively, Fig. 3N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, females had greater fiber area loss compared to males (−34.9% v. −13.6% respectively, Fig. 3O and −35.9% v. −13.2% respectively, Fig. 3P). 3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiflexion power (peak force divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (−45.2% v. +27.8% respectively, Fig. 4A), while no differences were detected in OVX/CAST groups at 0g (Fig. 4B). At 0.4g, there was no difference between SHAM females and males in dorsiflexion power loss (Fig. 4C). Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have greater loss in dorsiflexion power, though this difference did not reach significance (−36.1% v. +7.8% respectively, Fig. 4D). We should note that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiflexion parameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time.18 Fig. 4.

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.Maximal plantar flexion power was also evaluated. At 0g, females lost more plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−31.1% v. −3.2% respectively, Fig. 4E and −15.9% v. 12.3% respectively, (Fig. 4F). Additionally, at 0.4g, females also had greater loss in plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4G and −10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4H). 3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to males In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not significant (−26.4% v. −32.7%, Fig. 5A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative to males; however, this difference was again not significant (−32.0% v. −25.3%, Fig. 5B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males; however, neither of these differences reached significance (−21.1% v. −16.2%, Fig. 5C and −24.3% v. −18.4%, Fig. 5D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.There were no differences between females and males in relative soleus alterations at 0g in either SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (−53.6% v. −50.1%, Fig. 5E and −53.5% v. −52.9%, Fig. 5F). However, at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males (−34.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5G and −32.8% v. −22.8%, Fig. 5H). Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (−14.0% v. −20.4%, Fig. 5I and −18.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5J). Similarly, at 0.4g ​there were no differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of hormonal status (SHAM, −21.3% v. −18.0%, Fig. 5K and OVX/CAST, −26.7% v. −23.7%, Fig. 5L). At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) loss compared to males (−8.1% v. −15.7%, Fig. 5M). However, this difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats (Fig. 5N). After exposure to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes, regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 5O-P).",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, including muscle size (Figs. 2, Fig 3, and Fig 5) and muscle strength (Fig. 4), compared to males. These data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse atrophy,9,10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse.8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes.19 Although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force.19 Additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males.20 Other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture.21 In aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0.4g.15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females.15 Taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss.22, 23, 24 Regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced muscle atrophy. However, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse.8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males.9,10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males.9 We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains.25 There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains,26,27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study,19,20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files.18 It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses. Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise.28 These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females.29,30 The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods. We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,31 it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females. In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,8 more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.",

Copyright notice ID: 10831389 PMID: 38314043 Abstract Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.

Introduction Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.1, 2, 3 To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station (ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (∼2 ​h /day) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.4 Additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to muscle health. One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is 50% male and 50% female.5 Additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel. Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.6 Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.7 Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8 In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.9,10 These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.9,10 Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11 However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12 One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts. The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0–14 days of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps. Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats.2. Methods 2.1. Animal experiments Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020). The overall protocol (including pictorial description) for this study has been previously reported.15 Briefly, 120 male (M) and female (F) Fisher rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, Stock number: 002). At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks to recover; thereafter, they were divided into either simulated micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight, Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated 0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals’ hips to keep hindlimbs suspended from the ground, as we have previously described.16,17 Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced loading, as we have previously described.16,17 Partial weight-bearing was assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing. A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in interventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30%–70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute. Death was confirmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected and weighed. Soleus muscles were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 ​h and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis. Gonadectomy status and associated alterations are detailed in our previous manuscript using these animals.15 Animal housing: Conditions for housing has been published previously.15 Briefly, all animals were singly housed in custom-made cages specifically designed for micro-gravity or partial weight-bearing interventions. Animals were kept in the BIDMC animal facility at ∼22 ​°C with a 12:12 light cycle. Animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum throughout the study. Rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress (> 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.), it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss. Grip Strength: Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described.15 Briefly, animals’ hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA). Animals were gently pulled from the bar until they released their grip; the corresponding force was recorded. Animals repeated this measurement two more times; the greatest value was utilized for data analysis. Maximally stimulated muscle strength: Maximal stimulation of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion muscles was completed as previously described.15 Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen using a vaporizing system. The animal's left foot was then taped to a footplate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and adjusted to ensure ∼90% of dorsiflexion at the ankle joint and alignment of the ankle and knee joints. The animal's tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. To confirm appropriate needle placement, a small (10 ​Hz) stimulation was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was confirmed, a 200 ​Hz stimulation for 200 ​ms was applied to the nerve generating a maximal tetanus. Maximal tetanic measurements were visually inspected by a researcher to ensure maximal tetanus was achieved. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT): Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, Stratee, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany) was utilized to quantify total muscle cross-sectional area in the tibial compartment, as previously described.15 Anesthetized animals (∼2% isoflurane) were positioned and images were captured 40 ​mm from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition parameters: voxel size: 0.10 ​mm, Ct speed: 10 ​mm/s. Images were analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area with specified software provided by the manufacturer. Histology: Histological preparation and analysis was completed as we have previously described.8 After 48 ​h of fixation in 10% formalin and washing with PBS, soleus muscles were embedded in paraffin and stained for myosin heavy chain type I (ab11083; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), myosin heavy chain type II (ab91506; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize muscle fiber borders (W6748; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were collected with an epifluorescent microscope at 20 × magnification (Zeiss Axio Imager M1) and analyzed with Fiji (ImageJ, ) as we have previously described.8 All analyses were completed by a blinded investigator (DS). Statistical Analysis: Longitudinal data were analyzed as percent difference between baseline and post-intervention values with a covariate of baseline values. Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible influence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent differences were used to more directly compare data between males and females despite their significant differences in bodyweight and other muscle parameters. The specific research question was to evaluate differences between males and females at different simulated gravitational loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or OVX/CAST). Therefore, we developed a novel statistical model in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software using the least squared means estimate (LSMESTIMATE) statement within the procedure mixed (PROC MIXED) function. Primary comparisons of interest included: •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0g •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0.4g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0.4g These four primary comparisons were condensed into a priori contrasts and were tested globally with a joint F-test, as we have previously described.15 If the joint F-test was significant (p ​< ​0.05), individual contrasts were evaluated for differences between pre-planned comparisons. The p-values for specific contrasts were accommodated for multiple comparisons with a Holm's adjustment (p ​< ​0.05). Additionally, within each sex and hormonal status, an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of loading (1g, 0.4g, and 0g) was completed as a model validation. Significance was denoted with a global F-test of p ​< ​0.05 and pair-wise comparisons were investigated with a Tukey-adjusted p-value (p ​< ​0.05). Graphical representation of model validation analysis can be found in supplementary materials.18 All data analysis was completed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). All SAS coding (including datasets), SAS outputs, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available in Supplementary Files.183. Results 3.1. Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g (Fig. 1A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (+14.9% v. −6.8% respectively, Fig. 1B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (−9.4% v. −0.90%, Fig. 1C) and OVX/CAST conditions (−11.4% v. −3.9%, Fig. 1D). Fig. 1.

In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less loss in grip strength compared to males (−45.3% v. −67.9% respectively, Fig. 1F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in SHAM (Fig. 1G) or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 1H).3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-sectional area compared to males In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g, females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at 0g: −9.2% v. −4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2A; OVX/CAST at 0g: −11.7% v. 0.91% Fig. 2B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2C; OVX/CAST at 0.4g: −10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2D).

In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not significant (−19.3% v. −9.8% respectively, Fig. 2F). The same findings were observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (−17.9% v. −8.8%, Fig. 2G). However, in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (−16.8% v. −3.8% respectively, Fig. 2H).3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as males at 0g but greater muscle fiber area loss than males at 0.4g In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 ​g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber area (Fig. 3A–B). However, at 0.4 ​g in SHAM and OVX/CAST animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males (−34.8% v. −15.1% respectively, Fig. 3C). Moreover, this relationship was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (−29.8% v. −15.0% respectively, Fig. 3D). Fig. 3.

After 0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I fiber area loss compared to males (−34.7% v. −12.4% respectively, Fig. 3G and −28.3% v. −13.9% respectively, Fig. 3H). At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II) fibers between females and males (Fig. 3I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II fibers (Fig. 3K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences in type II fiber area, though this did not reach significance (−35.3% v. −17.1%, Fig. 3L). In muscle fibers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 ​g (Fig. 3M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males (−46.7% v. −29.1% respectively, Fig. 3N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, females had greater fiber area loss compared to males (−34.9% v. −13.6% respectively, Fig. 3O and −35.9% v. −13.2% respectively, Fig. 3P).3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiflexion power (peak force divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (−45.2% v. +27.8% respectively, Fig. 4A), while no differences were detected in OVX/CAST groups at 0g (Fig. 4B). At 0.4g, there was no difference between SHAM females and males in dorsiflexion power loss (Fig. 4C). Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have greater loss in dorsiflexion power, though this difference did not reach significance (−36.1% v. +7.8% respectively, Fig. 4D). We should note that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiflexion parameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time.18 Fig. 4.

At 0g, females lost more plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−31.1% v. −3.2% respectively, Fig. 4E and −15.9% v. 12.3% respectively, (Fig. 4F). Additionally, at 0.4g, females also had greater loss in plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4G and −10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4H).3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to males In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not significant (−26.4% v. −32.7%, Fig. 5A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative to males; however, this difference was again not significant (−32.0% v. −25.3%, Fig. 5B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males; however, neither of these differences reached significance (−21.1% v. −16.2%, Fig. 5C and −24.3% v. −18.4%, Fig. 5D).

However, at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males (−34.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5G and −32.8% v. −22.8%, Fig. 5H). Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (−14.0% v. −20.4%, Fig. 5I and −18.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5J). Similarly, at 0.4g ​there were no differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of hormonal status (SHAM, −21.3% v. −18.0%, Fig. 5K and OVX/CAST, −26.7% v. −23.7%, Fig. 5L). At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) loss compared to males (−8.1% v. −15.7%, Fig. 5M). However, this difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats (Fig. 5N). After exposure to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes, regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 5O-P).4. Discussion There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, including muscle size (Figs. 2, Fig 3, and Fig 5) and muscle strength (Fig. 4), compared to males. These data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse atrophy,9,10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse.8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes.19 Although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force.19 Additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males.20 Other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture.21 In aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0.4g.15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females.15 Taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss.22, 23, 24 Regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced muscle atrophy. However, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse.8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males.9,10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males.9 We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains.25 There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains,26,27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study,19,20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files.18 It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses. Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise.28 These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females.29,30 The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods. We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,31 it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females. In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,8 more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.Submission statement The authors certify that the submitted manuscript has not been published previously, is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, and if accepted will not be published elsewhere without the written consent of the copy-write holder.

    "abstract": "Abstract Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.1, 2, 3 To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station (ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (∼2 ​h /day) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.4 Additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to muscle health. One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is 50% male and 50% female.5 Additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel. Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.6 Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.7 Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8 In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.9,10 These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.9,10 Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11 However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12 One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts. The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0–14 days of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps. Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Animal experiments Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020). The overall protocol (including pictorial description) for this study has been previously reported.15 Briefly, 120 male (M) and female (F) Fisher rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, Stock number: 002). At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks to recover; thereafter, they were divided into either simulated micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight, Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated 0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals’ hips to keep hindlimbs suspended from the ground, as we have previously described.16,17 Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced loading, as we have previously described.16,17 Partial weight-bearing was assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing. A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in interventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30%–70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute. Death was confirmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected and weighed. Soleus muscles were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 ​h and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis. Gonadectomy status and associated alterations are detailed in our previous manuscript using these animals.15 Animal housing: Conditions for housing has been published previously.15 Briefly, all animals were singly housed in custom-made cages specifically designed for micro-gravity or partial weight-bearing interventions. Animals were kept in the BIDMC animal facility at ∼22 ​°C with a 12:12 light cycle. Animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum throughout the study. Rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress (> 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.), it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss. Grip Strength: Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described.15 Briefly, animals’ hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA). Animals were gently pulled from the bar until they released their grip; the corresponding force was recorded. Animals repeated this measurement two more times; the greatest value was utilized for data analysis. Maximally stimulated muscle strength: Maximal stimulation of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion muscles was completed as previously described.15 Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen using a vaporizing system. The animal's left foot was then taped to a footplate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and adjusted to ensure ∼90% of dorsiflexion at the ankle joint and alignment of the ankle and knee joints. The animal's tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. To confirm appropriate needle placement, a small (10 ​Hz) stimulation was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was confirmed, a 200 ​Hz stimulation for 200 ​ms was applied to the nerve generating a maximal tetanus. Maximal tetanic measurements were visually inspected by a researcher to ensure maximal tetanus was achieved. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT): Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, Stratee, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany) was utilized to quantify total muscle cross-sectional area in the tibial compartment, as previously described.15 Anesthetized animals (∼2% isoflurane) were positioned and images were captured 40 ​mm from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition parameters: voxel size: 0.10 ​mm, Ct speed: 10 ​mm/s. Images were analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area with specified software provided by the manufacturer. Histology: Histological preparation and analysis was completed as we have previously described.8 After 48 ​h of fixation in 10% formalin and washing with PBS, soleus muscles were embedded in paraffin and stained for myosin heavy chain type I (ab11083; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), myosin heavy chain type II (ab91506; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize muscle fiber borders (W6748; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were collected with an epifluorescent microscope at 20 × magnification (Zeiss Axio Imager M1) and analyzed with Fiji (ImageJ, ) as we have previously described.8 All analyses were completed by a blinded investigator (DS). Statistical Analysis: Longitudinal data were analyzed as percent difference between baseline and post-intervention values with a covariate of baseline values. Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible influence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent differences were used to more directly compare data between males and females despite their significant differences in bodyweight and other muscle parameters. The specific research question was to evaluate differences between males and females at different simulated gravitational loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or OVX/CAST). Therefore, we developed a novel statistical model in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software using the least squared means estimate (LSMESTIMATE) statement within the procedure mixed (PROC MIXED) function. Primary comparisons of interest included: •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0g •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0.4g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0.4g These four primary comparisons were condensed into a priori contrasts and were tested globally with a joint F-test, as we have previously described.15 If the joint F-test was significant (p ​< ​0.05), individual contrasts were evaluated for differences between pre-planned comparisons. The p-values for specific contrasts were accommodated for multiple comparisons with a Holm's adjustment (p ​< ​0.05). Additionally, within each sex and hormonal status, an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of loading (1g, 0.4g, and 0g) was completed as a model validation. Significance was denoted with a global F-test of p ​< ​0.05 and pair-wise comparisons were investigated with a Tukey-adjusted p-value (p ​< ​0.05). Graphical representation of model validation analysis can be found in supplementary materials.18 All data analysis was completed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). All SAS coding (including datasets), SAS outputs, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available in Supplementary Files.18",

Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g (Fig. 1A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (+14.9% v. −6.8% respectively, Fig. 1B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (−9.4% v. −0.90%, Fig. 1C) and OVX/CAST conditions (−11.4% v. −3.9%, Fig. 1D). Fig. 1.

In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less loss in grip strength compared to males (−45.3% v. −67.9% respectively, Fig. 1F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in SHAM (Fig. 1G) or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 1H). 3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-sectional area compared to males In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g, females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at 0g: −9.2% v. −4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2A; OVX/CAST at 0g: −11.7% v. 0.91% Fig. 2B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2C; OVX/CAST at 0.4g: −10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.With regards to total muscle cross-sectional area loss of the lower leg, there were no differences between SHAM females and males at 0g (Fig. 2E). In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not significant (−19.3% v. −9.8% respectively, Fig. 2F). The same findings were observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (−17.9% v. −8.8%, Fig. 2G). However, in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (−16.8% v. −3.8% respectively, Fig. 2H). 3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as males at 0g but greater muscle fiber area loss than males at 0.4g In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 ​g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber area (Fig. 3A–B). However, at 0.4 ​g in SHAM and OVX/CAST animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males (−34.8% v. −15.1% respectively, Fig. 3C). Moreover, this relationship was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (−29.8% v. −15.0% respectively, Fig. 3D). Fig. 3.

Individual data points are percent difference from within sex and hormone-status 1g (fully loaded) control animals. Data are presented as Mean ​± ​SEM. SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.In myosin heavy chain type I-positive fibers (hereafter referred to as type I fibers), there was no difference between SHAM females and males after 0g intervention (Fig. 3E), nor within OVX/CAST rats (Fig. 3F). After 0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I fiber area loss compared to males (−34.7% v. −12.4% respectively, Fig. 3G and −28.3% v. −13.9% respectively, Fig. 3H). At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II) fibers between females and males (Fig. 3I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II fibers (Fig. 3K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences in type II fiber area, though this did not reach significance (−35.3% v. −17.1%, Fig. 3L). In muscle fibers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 ​g (Fig. 3M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males (−46.7% v. −29.1% respectively, Fig. 3N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, females had greater fiber area loss compared to males (−34.9% v. −13.6% respectively, Fig. 3O and −35.9% v. −13.2% respectively, Fig. 3P). 3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiflexion power (peak force divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (−45.2% v. +27.8% respectively, Fig. 4A), while no differences were detected in OVX/CAST groups at 0g (Fig. 4B). At 0.4g, there was no difference between SHAM females and males in dorsiflexion power loss (Fig. 4C). Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have greater loss in dorsiflexion power, though this difference did not reach significance (−36.1% v. +7.8% respectively, Fig. 4D). We should note that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiflexion parameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time.18 Fig. 4.

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.Maximal plantar flexion power was also evaluated. At 0g, females lost more plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−31.1% v. −3.2% respectively, Fig. 4E and −15.9% v. 12.3% respectively, (Fig. 4F). Additionally, at 0.4g, females also had greater loss in plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4G and −10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4H). 3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to males In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not significant (−26.4% v. −32.7%, Fig. 5A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative to males; however, this difference was again not significant (−32.0% v. −25.3%, Fig. 5B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males; however, neither of these differences reached significance (−21.1% v. −16.2%, Fig. 5C and −24.3% v. −18.4%, Fig. 5D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.There were no differences between females and males in relative soleus alterations at 0g in either SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (−53.6% v. −50.1%, Fig. 5E and −53.5% v. −52.9%, Fig. 5F). However, at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males (−34.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5G and −32.8% v. −22.8%, Fig. 5H). Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (−14.0% v. −20.4%, Fig. 5I and −18.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5J). Similarly, at 0.4g ​there were no differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of hormonal status (SHAM, −21.3% v. −18.0%, Fig. 5K and OVX/CAST, −26.7% v. −23.7%, Fig. 5L). At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) loss compared to males (−8.1% v. −15.7%, Fig. 5M). However, this difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats (Fig. 5N). After exposure to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes, regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 5O-P).",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, including muscle size (Figs. 2, Fig 3, and Fig 5) and muscle strength (Fig. 4), compared to males. These data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse atrophy,9,10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse.8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes.19 Although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force.19 Additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males.20 Other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture.21 In aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0.4g.15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females.15 Taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss.22, 23, 24 Regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced muscle atrophy. However, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse.8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males.9,10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males.9 We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains.25 There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains,26,27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study,19,20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files.18 It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses. Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise.28 These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females.29,30 The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods. We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,31 it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females. In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,8 more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.",

Copyright notice ID: 10831389 PMID: 38314043 Abstract Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.

Introduction Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.1, 2, 3 To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station (ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (∼2 ​h /day) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.4 Additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to muscle health. One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is 50% male and 50% female.5 Additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel. Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.6 Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.7 Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8 In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.9,10 These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.9,10 Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11 However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12 One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts. The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0–14 days of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps. Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats.2. Methods 2.1. Animal experiments Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020). The overall protocol (including pictorial description) for this study has been previously reported.15 Briefly, 120 male (M) and female (F) Fisher rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, Stock number: 002). At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks to recover; thereafter, they were divided into either simulated micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight, Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated 0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals’ hips to keep hindlimbs suspended from the ground, as we have previously described.16,17 Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced loading, as we have previously described.16,17 Partial weight-bearing was assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing. A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in interventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30%–70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute. Death was confirmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected and weighed. Soleus muscles were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 ​h and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis. Gonadectomy status and associated alterations are detailed in our previous manuscript using these animals.15 Animal housing: Conditions for housing has been published previously.15 Briefly, all animals were singly housed in custom-made cages specifically designed for micro-gravity or partial weight-bearing interventions. Animals were kept in the BIDMC animal facility at ∼22 ​°C with a 12:12 light cycle. Animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum throughout the study. Rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress (> 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.), it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss. Grip Strength: Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described.15 Briefly, animals’ hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA). Animals were gently pulled from the bar until they released their grip; the corresponding force was recorded. Animals repeated this measurement two more times; the greatest value was utilized for data analysis. Maximally stimulated muscle strength: Maximal stimulation of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion muscles was completed as previously described.15 Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen using a vaporizing system. The animal's left foot was then taped to a footplate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and adjusted to ensure ∼90% of dorsiflexion at the ankle joint and alignment of the ankle and knee joints. The animal's tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiflexion or plantar flexion. To confirm appropriate needle placement, a small (10 ​Hz) stimulation was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was confirmed, a 200 ​Hz stimulation for 200 ​ms was applied to the nerve generating a maximal tetanus. Maximal tetanic measurements were visually inspected by a researcher to ensure maximal tetanus was achieved. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT): Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, Stratee, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany) was utilized to quantify total muscle cross-sectional area in the tibial compartment, as previously described.15 Anesthetized animals (∼2% isoflurane) were positioned and images were captured 40 ​mm from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition parameters: voxel size: 0.10 ​mm, Ct speed: 10 ​mm/s. Images were analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area with specified software provided by the manufacturer. Histology: Histological preparation and analysis was completed as we have previously described.8 After 48 ​h of fixation in 10% formalin and washing with PBS, soleus muscles were embedded in paraffin and stained for myosin heavy chain type I (ab11083; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), myosin heavy chain type II (ab91506; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize muscle fiber borders (W6748; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were collected with an epifluorescent microscope at 20 × magnification (Zeiss Axio Imager M1) and analyzed with Fiji (ImageJ, ) as we have previously described.8 All analyses were completed by a blinded investigator (DS). Statistical Analysis: Longitudinal data were analyzed as percent difference between baseline and post-intervention values with a covariate of baseline values. Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible influence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent differences were used to more directly compare data between males and females despite their significant differences in bodyweight and other muscle parameters. The specific research question was to evaluate differences between males and females at different simulated gravitational loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or OVX/CAST). Therefore, we developed a novel statistical model in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software using the least squared means estimate (LSMESTIMATE) statement within the procedure mixed (PROC MIXED) function. Primary comparisons of interest included: •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0g •SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0.4g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0g •CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0.4g These four primary comparisons were condensed into a priori contrasts and were tested globally with a joint F-test, as we have previously described.15 If the joint F-test was significant (p ​< ​0.05), individual contrasts were evaluated for differences between pre-planned comparisons. The p-values for specific contrasts were accommodated for multiple comparisons with a Holm's adjustment (p ​< ​0.05). Additionally, within each sex and hormonal status, an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of loading (1g, 0.4g, and 0g) was completed as a model validation. Significance was denoted with a global F-test of p ​< ​0.05 and pair-wise comparisons were investigated with a Tukey-adjusted p-value (p ​< ​0.05). Graphical representation of model validation analysis can be found in supplementary materials.18 All data analysis was completed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). All SAS coding (including datasets), SAS outputs, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available in Supplementary Files.183. Results 3.1. Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g (Fig. 1A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (+14.9% v. −6.8% respectively, Fig. 1B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (−9.4% v. −0.90%, Fig. 1C) and OVX/CAST conditions (−11.4% v. −3.9%, Fig. 1D). Fig. 1.

In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less loss in grip strength compared to males (−45.3% v. −67.9% respectively, Fig. 1F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in SHAM (Fig. 1G) or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 1H).3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-sectional area compared to males In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g, females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at 0g: −9.2% v. −4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2A; OVX/CAST at 0g: −11.7% v. 0.91% Fig. 2B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2C; OVX/CAST at 0.4g: −10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.With regards to total muscle cross-sectional area loss of the lower leg, there were no differences between SHAM females and males at 0g (Fig. 2E). In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not significant (−19.3% v. −9.8% respectively, Fig. 2F). The same findings were observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (−17.9% v. −8.8%, Fig. 2G). However, in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (−16.8% v. −3.8% respectively, Fig. 2H).3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as males at 0g but greater muscle fiber area loss than males at 0.4g In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 ​g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber area (Fig. 3A–B). However, at 0.4 ​g in SHAM and OVX/CAST animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males (−34.8% v. −15.1% respectively, Fig. 3C). Moreover, this relationship was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (−29.8% v. −15.0% respectively, Fig. 3D). Fig. 3.

Individual data points are percent difference from within sex and hormone-status 1g (fully loaded) control animals. Data are presented as Mean ​± ​SEM. SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean.In myosin heavy chain type I-positive fibers (hereafter referred to as type I fibers), there was no difference between SHAM females and males after 0g intervention (Fig. 3E), nor within OVX/CAST rats (Fig. 3F). After 0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I fiber area loss compared to males (−34.7% v. −12.4% respectively, Fig. 3G and −28.3% v. −13.9% respectively, Fig. 3H). At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II) fibers between females and males (Fig. 3I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II fibers (Fig. 3K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences in type II fiber area, though this did not reach significance (−35.3% v. −17.1%, Fig. 3L). In muscle fibers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 ​g (Fig. 3M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males (−46.7% v. −29.1% respectively, Fig. 3N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, females had greater fiber area loss compared to males (−34.9% v. −13.6% respectively, Fig. 3O and −35.9% v. −13.2% respectively, Fig. 3P).3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiflexion power (peak force divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (−45.2% v. +27.8% respectively, Fig. 4A), while no differences were detected in OVX/CAST groups at 0g (Fig. 4B). At 0.4g, there was no difference between SHAM females and males in dorsiflexion power loss (Fig. 4C). Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have greater loss in dorsiflexion power, though this difference did not reach significance (−36.1% v. +7.8% respectively, Fig. 4D). We should note that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiflexion parameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time.18 Fig. 4.

Additionally, at 0.4g, females also had greater loss in plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4G and −10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4H).3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to males In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not significant (−26.4% v. −32.7%, Fig. 5A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative to males; however, this difference was again not significant (−32.0% v. −25.3%, Fig. 5B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males; however, neither of these differences reached significance (−21.1% v. −16.2%, Fig. 5C and −24.3% v. −18.4%, Fig. 5D).

However, at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males (−34.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5G and −32.8% v. −22.8%, Fig. 5H). Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (−14.0% v. −20.4%, Fig. 5I and −18.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5J). Similarly, at 0.4g ​there were no differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of hormonal status (SHAM, −21.3% v. −18.0%, Fig. 5K and OVX/CAST, −26.7% v. −23.7%, Fig. 5L). At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) loss compared to males (−8.1% v. −15.7%, Fig. 5M). However, this difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats (Fig. 5N). After exposure to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes, regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 5O-P).4. Discussion There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, including muscle size (Figs. 2, Fig 3, and Fig 5) and muscle strength (Fig. 4), compared to males. These data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse atrophy,9,10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse.8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes.19 Although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force.19 Additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males.20 Other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture.21 In aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0.4g.15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females.15 Taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss.22, 23, 24 Regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced muscle atrophy. However, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse.8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males.9,10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males.9 We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains.25 There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains,26,27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study,19,20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files.18 It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses. Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise.28 These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females.29,30 The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods. We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,31 it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females. In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,8 more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.Submission statement The authors certify that the submitted manuscript has not been published previously, is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, and if accepted will not be published elsewhere without the written consent of the copy-write holder.

Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure [lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs)], the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentiation zone (Perilli and Sabatini, 2010; Lee et al., 2013). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and meristematic cells of the proximal/distal meristems, and differentiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation/differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination (Scheres, 2007; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cell—which is separate from the QC—divides to form transit-amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (Scheres, 2007; Perilli et al., 2012). Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in Bennett and Scheres, 2010; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011; Lee et al., 2013). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Friml et al., 2003; Blilou et al., 2005). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem (Sabatini et al., 1999). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) (Grieneisen et al., 2007). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewicz et al., 2007). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hormones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes (Zhu et al., 2013). Upon binding of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1/SERK3)(Bücherl et al., 2013), and the fully activated BRI1/BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassinazole resistant 1/BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1/BES2) and BZR2/BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development (He et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1/BES1 is crucial for BR activities (Wang et al., 2002; Yin et al., 2002), and this localization is dependent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1/BES1 proteins (Gampala et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2010). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1/BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway (Li and Nam, 2002; Yan et al., 2009). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth (Tang et al., 2011). BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations (Müssig et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2007). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such as bes1-D, show premature cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of meristematic cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of provascular and QC cells (Fàbregas et al., 2013). Recently two BR transcriptional targets— brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRAVO) and ethylene response factor 115 (ERF115)—regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified (Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014). BRAVO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRAVO (Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulating ERF115 expression (Heyman et al., 2013). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulation/re-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distribution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expression regulation of BRAVO, ERF115, and other root-regulating genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-/BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner.",
    "methods": "",
    "results": "Results Both BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways stimulate mitotic reactivation of QC cells The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011; Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and results in CSC differentiation (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR-regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips of pBZR1:BZR1-YFP plants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) (Fig. 1A). It was found that, contrary to a previous report (Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014), supplying BL in the medium enhanced nuclear localization of BZR1 in the cells of the SCN area, so that concentrated nuclear expression was found in the root tip cells including the QC, cells above the QC, the CSC, and CCs (Fig. 1A). Similar localization of BZR1 was evident within 15min when BL was applied to 7-d-old seedlings (data not shown). This implies that not only the reported BES1- but also the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway may actively be involved in QC division and the distal CSC differentiation. To assess roles of the BZR1-mediated signalling pathway in these developmental processes, whether the BR and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway modulates the mitotically inactive status of the QC was investigated. Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M BL showed an increased frequency of mitotically activated QC cells, such that 58% of plants had two layers of QC cells with periclinal division by 7 d after germination (DAG) as determined by morphologic lineage (Fig. 1B). In comparison, 5% of untreated Col-0 plants harboured double layers of QC cells. Consistent with a previous report (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011), more than 80% of plants with the bes1-D BR-signalling enhancing mutation in an En-2 background showed reactivated QC cell layers by 7 DAG, increasing to 100% by 14 DAG (Fig 1B, C; Supplementary Table S3, available at JXB online). It was next examined whether BZR1-mediated BR signalling results in similar QC reactivation. It was found that the QC was also frequently reactivated in BR-signalling enhanced bzr1-D plants, such that two QC layers were observed in 50% of the plants by 7 DAG and in 75% of the plants by 14 DAG (Fig. 1B, C; Supplementary Table S3). This QC reactivation was less frequent than that in bes1-D plants, but was greatly enhanced compared with Col-0 and BR-signalling defective bri1-116 plants, which hardly ever showed QC division at 7 DAG. Introduction of bzr1-D clearly reactivated the QC of bri1-116 (divided QCs were present in 37% of the bri1-116/bzr1-D plants by 7 DAG and 69% by 14 DAG), which implies that BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling is actively involved in reactivation of QC division. WOX5 expression in the embryonic cell lineage leads to QC formation and is involved in maintaining the stem cell state in a non-autonomous manner (Haeker et al., 2004; Sarkar et al., 2007). It was demonstrated that the QC marker WOX5 was expressed in both divided QC cells while a cortex marker (pC O 2::YFP H2B, Heidstra et al., 2004), was unchanged in its expression pattern when these plants were grown on medium containing BL (Fig. 1D). SCARECROW (SCR) is required for specification of QC identity, stem cell homeostasis and asymmetric cell division (Sabatini et al., 2003; Moubayidin et al., 2013). In this study, the SCR reporter plants grown on medium containing BL reactivated QC cell division as determined by morphologic cell lineage but, unexpectedly, SCR protein accumulated predominantly in the upper QC in most BL-treated cells. To verify the effect of BR on QC division, bzr1-D was crossed with different cell-specific marker lines (Fig. 1D). For bzr1-D×pWOX5::GFP, 50% of the plants showed GFP expression in both the upper and lower cells of the QC whereas the other 50% showed expression only in the upper cell. In most bzr1-D×pSCR::GFP, the GFP signal was present only in the upper cell of the QC. This lack of WOX5 and SCR expression in the rootward QC cells may indicate an asymmetric QC division and loss of functional QC identity. Ethylene overexpressor 1 (ETO1) and CULLIN3 (CUL3) are a part of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that modulates the level of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 5 (ACS5) catalysing the rate-limiting step of ethylene biosynthesis. It was previously reported that the gain-of-function eto1-11 mutant overproduces ethylene and promotes QC cell division (Ortega-Martinez et al., 2007). In this regard, it was tested whether the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway interacts with ETO1-promoted ethylene pathway in the regulation of the QC cell division. bzr1-D plants grown for 8 DAG showed QC cell division at a frequency of 74% (Fig. 1E). Treatment of neither an ethylene action inhibitor AgNO3 nor biosynthetic inhibitors, aminoethoxy-vinylglycine (AVG) and CoCl2, interfered with this bzr1-D-induced QC cell division. Similarly, treatment of eto1-11 mutants with BRZ, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor (Asami et al., 2000), did not significantly influence the QC reactivation frequency of eto1-11 plants (Fig. 1F). Moreover, both eto1-11 genetic background provoking QC cell division at a frequency of 61% and treatment of BL inducing cell division at a frequency of 45% additively coordinated the promotion of QC cell reactivation, thus BL-treated eto1-11 plants showed two-layered reactivated QC cells at a frequency of 97%. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting BZR1-mediated QC reactivation, expression of WOX5, SCR, and SHR genes was significantly increased by both short-term (3h, Fig. 1G) and long-term (7 DAG, Fig. 1H) treatments of BL. Consistent with BR-induced up-regulation, their expression was significantly repressed in BR signalling-defective bri1-116 plants, but greatly increased in signalling-enhanced bzr1-D plants and bri1-116/bzr1-D double mutants (Fig. 1I). In addition, BL treatment greatly suppressed gene expression of BRAVO (a negative regulator of QC divisions; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and increased the expression of ERF115 (a positive regulator of QC division; Heyman et al., 2013) in both the short-term and long-term treated Col-0 plants (Fig. 1G, H). Again, their expression was tightly controlled in a BRI1/BZR1-mediated signalling-dependent manner (Fig. 1I). Expression of BRAVO and ERF115 was similarly regulated in bes1-D plants to those of bzr1-D plants. Expression of genes regulating ethylene biosynthesis was also examined, and it was found that expression of CUL3, ACS5, and ETO1 was not regulated by BR treatment nor was it different in bzr1-D or bes1-D plants compared with the Col-0 or En-2 plants, respectively (Fig 1G–I). These results support the conclusion that BRs promote QC cell division independently from the ethylene pathway. BRs apparently exert opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in a concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner Results presented thus far have shown that the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway was able to reactivate and produce multiple layers of the QC (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S3 available at JXB online). In addition, BL treatment greatly enhanced expression of a columella initial marker, J2341, and expanded its expression to the QC, CC, and other root tip cells (Fig. 1D). These observations, together with BL-induced intense nuclear localization of BZR1 in the QC, CSCs, and CCs (Fig. 1A), prompted an investigation of the effects of BR on the maintenance and differentiation of distal CSCs by examining the development of starch-accumulated columella cells. First, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was measured for Col-0 (Fig. 2A) and BR biosynthesis-defective de-etiolated2 (det2; Noguchi et al., 1999) (Fig. 2B) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 10−15 to 10−9 M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS-PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration-dependent manner in both Col-0 and det2 plants. Less than 10% of Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60% and 82% of Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M and 10−9 M, respectively, contained two layers of QC (Fig. 2A, D). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treatment. Most Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15% of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (25–30%) by the 10−15 M to 10−11 M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52% by the 10−10 M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57% seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43% with three layers of CCs (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M BL showed 25% seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68% with three layers of CCs, and 7% with two layers of CCs. These concentration-dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL-treated det2 plants (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, treatment of Col-0 plants with a higher concentration of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development: it promoted CSC differentiation and the resulting CC development. Seventeen percent of Col-0 plants grown on 10−9 M BL had two layers of CSCs, which is far below the frequency compared with those of the plants grown on 10−15 M to 10−11 M of BL, and is about the same frequency as with mock-treated plants. Moreover, plants with no CSC (whose starch granules of cells resided underneath the QC were stained with PI) were present at a frequency of 18%, which was hardly observed in the mock- and lower BL-treated Col-0 plants (Fig. 2A, D). Consistent with this observation, an increased frequency of plants with a higher number of CC layers was observed in plants grown on medium containing 10−9 M BL than in plants grown with lower concentrations of BL. Similar observations were previously reported in Col-0 plants treated with 4×10−9 M BL and the bes1-D BR gain-of-function mutant (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in BL-treated det2 plants (Fig. 2B). Treatment of BR-deficient det2 plants with higher concentrations of BL further increased the number of CSC layers and dramatically decreased the number of CC layers accordingly. These results strongly indicate that BRs differentially regulate distal CSC differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner: they inhibit the stem cell differentiation at low concentrations and promote it at higher concentrations. In support of data presented here, Col-0 plants grown on media containing BK, an inhibitor of BIN2 (a negative regulator of the BR signalling pathway) (De Rybel et al, 2009) showed similar results to plants treated with lower concentrations of BL (data not shown). Also of note was that BL treatments not only modulated CSC differentiation, as determined by counting the number of cell layers stained with PI or below the stained cells, but also weakened the intensity of PI staining (Fig. 2D). At the extreme, most Col-0 plants treated with 10−9 M BL had 1–3 cells in the lowest layers that were not stained at all. This result implies that BR may be involved in starch development as well as differentiation of the distal meristem. Next, to investigate the BRI1/BZR1-dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR-related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011), bes1-D plants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation (Fig. 2C, E). Twenty percent of En-2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80% carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70% of bes1-D plants harboured two-layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion of bes1-D plants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52% of the bes1-D plants had single-layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83% of En-2 plants carried single-layered CSCs and the remaining 17% had two-layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in the bes1-D in that 16% of the plants had five layers, 39% four layers, and 45% three layers. In comparison, En-2 plants showed 3% with five-layered, 27% with four-layered, and the remaining 70% with three-layered CCs. Comparing Col-0 plants with bri1-116, bzr1-D, and bri1-116/bzr1-D plants, 17% of Col-0 plants had two-layered QCs and the remaining 83% showed single-layered QCs by 8 DAG on MS media (Fig. 2C, E). In the same population of Col-0 plants, it was found that 90% of plants carried single-layered CSCs and a half developed four-layered CCs while the other half developed five-layered CCs. In comparison, the frequency of plants with single-layered QCs and CSCs in a BR-signalling defective mutant was slightly increased so that 98% of the bri1-116 plants carried single-layered QC or CSC. This implies that a defective BR signalling pathway may result in retardation of QC or CSC cell division or differentiation. Development of CCs was also slightly inhibited compared with the Col-0 plants: 20% of bri1-116 plants had five-layered, 72% four-layered, and the remaining 8% had three-layered CCs. Interestingly, a similar trend of reduction in CC layers was also observed in the BRZ-treated Col plants (data not shown). A BR-signalling enhanced mutant, bzr1-D, showed an increased frequency of plants with two-layered QCs as expected (80% with two-layered and the remaining 20% with single-layered plants). In addition, the frequency of plants with two-layered CSCs also dramatically increased (45% with two-layered and the rest with single-layered plants) as seen in the case of BL-treated Col-0 plants. Concurrently, the frequency of plants with fewer CC layers in the bzr1-D mutant was greatly increased in that 32% of the plants had four CC layers and the remaining 68% had three-layered CCs. A double mutant of the BR signal pathway, bri1-116/bzr1-D, had a similar frequency of plants with QC layers to bzr1-D and an intermediate frequency of plants with CSC and CC layers between bri1-116 and bzr1-1D. These results imply that differentiation of CSC and the resulting development of CC are under the control of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, and that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, in opposition to BES1-mediated signalling, inhibits the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying development of starch-filled columella cells. In addition, it seems that a defect in either BR biosynthesis (in the case of BRZ-treated Col plants) or in the signalling pathway (in the case of bri1-116) show similar results to BL treatment and BZR1-mediated signal enhancement. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts on the auxin pathway and shows an antagonistic effect on auxin-stimulated CSC differentiation The auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction of WOX5 transcription in the QC (Wang et al., 2005; Ding and Friml, 2010). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect of the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway involves interaction with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col-0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single-layered CSC and the remaining 10% of plants had two layers of CSCs (Fig. 3A, B). In the same population, 23% of the Col-0 plants had five- or six-layered, 64% had four-layered, and 13% had three-layered CCs. As reported previously (Ding and Friml, 2010), Col-0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single-layered CSCs in NAA-treated Col-0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52% from 90% in the untreated Col-0 plants. Moreover, 48% of the NAA-treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA-treated plants with more CC layers increased significantly: 30% of the auxin-treated plants carried six-layered CCs, 35% with five-layered, and the remaining 35% had four-layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO-IAA, Yoshimoto et al., 2012) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers compared with those of Col-0 plants. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts upstream of auxin in the regulation of CSC differentiation. (A) Effects of auxin-related chemicals on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Col-0 and bzr1-D plants. (B) Pictures of representative seedlings used for the cell layer measurement presented in (A). Seedlings were grown for 8 DAG on 1/2 MS agar media in the absence or presence of NAA (10−6 M) and PEO-IAA (2×10−5 M). The CSC and CC layers were identified as described in Fig. 2. n>50 seedlings for each treatment. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)It has been shown in BL-treated Col-0 and bzr1-D plants that the frequency of plants with a higher number of CSC layers was increased and the number of CC layers was decreased compared with those of Col plants (Figs 2A–C and 3A). However, NAA greatly negated the effects of the bzr1-D mutation, so that it led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of plants with fewer CSC layers and subsequent enhanced differentiation of CSC into CC layers, as in the case of Col-0 plants treated with the same chemicals (Fig. 3A, B). For example, 32% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried no CSC layer while only 6% of the untreated plants had no CSC layer. For CC layers, 58% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried five-layered CSCs while only 5% were observed in untreated plants. In addition, treatment of PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants slightly augmented the bzr1-D mutation effect, so that the frequency of plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers was slightly increased compared with the untreated bzr1-D plants. For example, 45% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried two-layered CSCs while 31% of the untreated plants had two-layered CSCs. For CC layers, 72% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried four-layered CSCs while this was observed in 66% of the untreated plants. Nonetheless, it was noticed that treatment of NAA or PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants did not completely lead to frequencies of CSC and CC layers observed in Col-0 plants treated by the same auxin-related chemicals. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR regulation on CSC differentiation and the following CC development partly act on the auxin action antagonistically, and a part of BZR1-mediated BR regulation for these developments may act in parallel to auxin. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expression/subcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed (Blilou et al., 2005). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem (Friml et al., 2002). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip using DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP plants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells (Fig. 4A, C), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls (Fig. 4B). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL (Fig. 4A). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10−10 M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10−10 M)-treated DR5::GUS seedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, the DR5::GFP expression domain in bzr1-D plants and mx3 transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form of BZR1 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP) moved to the proximal area (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, some DR5::GUS plants treated with 10−9 M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs (Fig. 4A). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL (Fig. 2A, D). As expected, the gradual expression of DR5::GUS and correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (Fig. 4C). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip. The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins (Grieneisen et al., 2007). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regulation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation (Friml et al., 2002; Blilou et al., 2005). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localization of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col-0 and PIN reporter plants for 3h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the expression of PINs in a concentration-dependent manner: treatment of Col-0 roots for a short period (3h) with BR at low concentration (5×10−10 M) greatly suppressed expression of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 genes whereas treatment with a higher concentration of BL (5×10−6 M) resulted in enhanced expression of PIN7 (Fig. 5A). A similar down-regulation of PIN gene expression was also observed for plants growing on a MS solid medium containing 5×10−10 M BL for a long period (7 DAG) (Fig. 5B). This regulation of PIN genes, especially for PIN4, was dependent on BRI1-/BZR1-mediated signalling pathways so that gene expression of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 was significantly enhanced in a bri1-116 background compared with the Col-0 plants. On the other hand, expression was significantly down-regulated (PIN4), slightly increased (PIN3) without statistical significance, or maintained at the Col-0 control level (PIN7) in bzr1-D plants (Fig. 5C). Moreover, up-regulation of the PIN genes by bri1-116 mutation was partly negated by the bzr1-D mutation background in bri1-116/bzr1-D double mutants. This bzr1-D down-regulation effect of PIN genes resembles exogenous BL treatment at lower concentrations. In contrast, PIN7 expression was greatly increased in bes1-D mutants, which resembles the gene expression in plants treated with a higher concentration of BL. These results are consistent with the observation that BR has opposing effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manners. Next, the PIN reporter plants were treated with BL, as done for the gene expression analysis, and PIN protein expression and subcellular localization was examined (Fig. 5D–F). Without BL treatment, PIN3-GFP protein of pPIN3::PIN3-GFP plants in this experimental condition accumulated in the cell membrane of CSC and CC1 to the CC3 with predominant expression in CC1 and CC2 (Fig. 5D, F; upper panel). In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (10−6 M) for 3h, the PIN3 expression domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3. At the same time, the characteristic plasma membrane-localized PIN3 pattern was gradually diminished, and PIN3 appeared in endosome- or vesicle-like internal structures (Fig. 5D) at a frequency of 25% in mock-treated plants, which jumped to 65% in the BL-treated plants (Fig. 5E). Finally, growing PIN3 reporter seedlings on medium supplemented with 10−10 M BL for 7 DAG resulted in a significant decrease in the number of PIN3 expression layers and intensity of the PIN3 protein expressed (Fig. 5F). For example, 44.4% of the reporter plants showed PIN3-GFP expression in >3 columella cell layers with high expression level while 27.8 % expressed in 1–2 columella cell layers with low expression intensity. In contrast, BL-treated plants displayed 36.8% of plants with expression in >3 columella cell layers with high or medium expression intensity, and 57.9% of plants showed expression in one columella cell layer with low expression intensity. PIN4-GFP protein showed a nonpolar localization mainly in the membrane of CC1 to CC3 with prominent basal accumulation (Fig. 5F; middle panels). PIN7-GFP protein showed a similar expression pattern with prominent expression in CC2 (Fig. 5F; lower panel). Similar to the BL-treated PIN3::PIN3-GFP plants, treatment of BL (10−10 M) to pPIN4::PIN4-GFP and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP plants for 7 DAG resulted in a reduction in expression layers and intensity of reporter proteins. In conclusion, the BR signalling pathway modulates PIN gene expression and protein localization, which may lead to proximal relocation of the auxin maximum in the root tip. BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1-dependent manner Transcriptional regulation of many protein factors plays an important role in the establishment, maintenance, and differentiation of the root apical meristem (reviewed in Lee et al., 2013). In this report, results have shown that BR-induced and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway regulates expression of several root-regulating genes including PINs and WOX5. To have a better understanding of how BR regulates CSC differentiation, transcriptional expression of other key root-regulating genes was examined in the presence or absence of BL. SOMBRERO (SMB) and FEZ proteins antagonistically regulate distal stem cell differentiation through transcriptional negative feedback regulation: FEZ promotes periclinal root cap-forming cell divisions and SMB negatively regulates FEZ activity, repressing stem cell-like divisions in the root cap daughter cells (Willemsen et al., 2008). Therefore, it was determined whether BR regulates expression of SMB and FEZ and whether the mode of this regulation is opposite for these genes. In Col-0 plants, BL up-regulated SMB expression whereas it down-regulated FEZ expression for short- and long-treatment with both low and high concentrations of BL (Fig. 6A, B). In bri1-116 plants, SMB expression was down-regulated but recovered to the level of Col-0 plants by introducing a bzr1-D mutation (bri1-116/bzr1-D, Fig. 6C). Given the fact that the smb-3 mutant has more CC layers and fez-2 has fewer CC layers (Willemsen et al., 2008), these results indicate that the BR-induced up-regulation of SMB and down-regulation of FEZ may contribute to the BR-induced and BZR1-mediated suppression of CSC differentiation. In support of this idea, FEZ expression was significantly down-regulated in bzr1-D plants. BEARSKIN 1 (BRN1) and BRN2, together with SMB, directly activate transcription of both vascular nac domain (VND) and nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor (NST) to regulate cell maturation in the root cap, which undergoes terminal differentiation and detachment from the root (Bennett et al., 2010). The results showed that BR up-regulated BRN2 expression in Col-0 plants during both short- and long-term treatment, and that this was under the control of BRI1/BZR1-mediated gene expression (Fig. 6A–C). The expression of BRN1 in Col-0 plants was not significantly changed by short-term treatment of BL, but was slightly decreased by prolonged treatment with 5×10−10 M of BL. Interestingly, its expression was enhanced in bes1-D plants. Further studies are needed to carefully analyse how this regulation of gene expression is linked to BR- and BZR1-mediated root cap maturation. Since BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1 or BES1-dependent manner in this system, it was tested whether BZR1 or BES1 binds to the promoter of these genes in vivo by performing ChIP-qPCR analysis using pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1-GFP plants. It was found that BRAVO and ERF115 contain at least one or two BZR1 and/or BES1-binding motifs in their promoter regions (Fig. 6D), and this is consistent with the previous result showing that their expression was tightly controlled by BRI1/BZR1-mediated signalling (Fig. 1I). PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 genes contain at least one BZR1- and BES1-binding motif, and these results are strongly supported by a previous report demonstrating that BZR1 may bind to PIN3, PIN4, PIN7 as evidenced by ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip) performed using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the BZR1-CFP protein from the BZR1 promoter (Sun et al., 2010). The BRN1 gene had at least one BZR1 and BES1-binding motif (Fig. 6D), but their effect on gene expression was different from each other (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data indicate that BR-induced nuclear BZR1 regulates expression of several key root-controlling genes by binding to their promoters, which may be resulting in BR-induced modulation of root stem cell division and differentiation in the root tip area including columella cell layers.",
    "discussion": "Discussion A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short-range non-cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state (van den Berg et al., 1997; Scheres, 2007). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (see Supplementary Figure S3 at JXB online for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down-regulating expression of BRAVO repressor while at the same time up-regulating ERF115, a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1-/BES1- and BL dose-dependent. The BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch-filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). Similarly, application of low concentrations of exogenous BL (~ ≤10−10 M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, while higher concentrations of BL (≥10−9 M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling. Similarly, bes1-D seedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark- and light-grown conditions (Yin et al., 2002) whereas bzr1-D seedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light (Wang et al., 2002). It has also been reported that BES1 acts as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor (He et al., 2005; Yin et al., 2005). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1-/BES1-dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration-dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC-regulating genes, such as FEZ and BRN1, seem to be differentially regulated in bzr1-D and bes1-D plants. BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development (Lee et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013 for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport (Bao et al., 2004), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). Transcript profiling and ChIP-chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signalling (Sun et al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that BRs down-regulate transcriptional expression of PINs and change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation of PIN genes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Epidermis-driven BR signalling and activity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele-localized PINs (PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7) (Hacham et al., 2011), but modulates transcriptional expression of PIN2 and PIN4 and their accumulation in the epidermis/cortex and columella in a post-transcriptional manner (Hacham et al., 2012). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR-directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR-mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink-driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin-driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss-of-function mutant Atpin4 exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling (Friml et al., 2002). Recent studies showed that auxin-induced repression of WOX5 results in enhanced CSC differentiation (Ding and Friml, 2010). The BL-treated plants and bzr1-D plants with enhanced BR signalling used here exhibited a decreased level of auxin in the distal root area and increased expression of WOX5. Concomitantly, they exhibited reactivated QCs, an increased number of undifferentiated CSC layers, and a corresponding decreased number of columella cell layers. In summary, these findings indicate that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibits auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation in Arabidopsis roots through action that is antagonistic to the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. It is also possible that BR-driven nuclear BZR1 directly binds to the promoter of root-regulating genes such as PINs, BRAVO, ERF115, FEZ, and BRN1, and independently regulates QC division and the distal stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of WOX5 and thus maintains quiescence of the QC and suppresses differentiation of the columella initials (Zhang et al., 2010). This phenomenon of ABA-induced WOX5 expression and promotion of stem cell maintenance is opposite to the BZR1-mediated WOX5 induction and reactivation of QC division in root tips that was observed in this study. Based on these apparently contradictory reports, it is highly plausible that differential regulation or mode of action of each hormone is involved in multiple cellular processes in distinctive root tissues or cell types, such as the QC, CSC, and CC. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify their mode of action and interactomes by dissecting details of these regulatory frameworks and establishing their interaction with other hormones. It has been demonstrated that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting this observation, treatment of ethylene biosynthetic precursor ACC promoted QC division without promoting BZR1 nuclear accumulation in the QC (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell-type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated (Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dissect the connections among the dose-dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling molecules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF-binding DR5-based auxin-inducible reporter (Ulmasov et al., 1997; Barbez et al., 2013) and an Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor (DII-VENUS; Brunoud et al., 2012) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolution in a single-cell-based tobacco system and in planta. Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR-regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understanding of BR-regulated meristem function in plants.",

Copyright notice ID: 4507784 PMID: 26136267 Highlight Brassinosteroids (BRs) lead to ectopic activation of quiescent centre division as well as modulation of the columella stem cells differentiation in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. Key words: Auxin, brassinosteroid, BZR1, columella stem cell, PINs, quiescent centre (QC), root apical meristem, root development.Abstract Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.Introduction The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) (Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, 2010). Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascular tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure [lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs)], the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentiation zone (Perilli and Sabatini, 2010; Lee et al., 2013). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and meristematic cells of the proximal/distal meristems, and differentiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation/differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination (Scheres, 2007; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cell—which is separate from the QC—divides to form transit-amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (Scheres, 2007; Perilli et al., 2012). Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in Bennett and Scheres, 2010; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011; Lee et al., 2013). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Friml et al., 2003; Blilou et al., 2005). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem (Sabatini et al., 1999). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) (Grieneisen et al., 2007). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewicz et al., 2007). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hormones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes (Zhu et al., 2013). Upon binding of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1/SERK3)(Bücherl et al., 2013), and the fully activated BRI1/BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassinazole resistant 1/BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1/BES2) and BZR2/BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development (He et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1/BES1 is crucial for BR activities (Wang et al., 2002; Yin et al., 2002), and this localization is dependent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1/BES1 proteins (Gampala et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2010). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1/BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway (Li and Nam, 2002; Yan et al., 2009). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth (Tang et al., 2011). BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations (Müssig et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2007). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such as bes1-D, show premature cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of meristematic cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of provascular and QC cells (Fàbregas et al., 2013). Recently two BR transcriptional targets— brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRAVO) and ethylene response factor 115 (ERF115)—regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified (Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014). BRAVO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRAVO (Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulating ERF115 expression (Heyman et al., 2013). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulation/re-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distribution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expression regulation of BRAVO, ERF115, and other root-regulating genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-/BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner.Materials and methods Plant materials and growth conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant eto1-11 and BR-related mutants (det2, bri1-116, bzr1-D, and bri1-116/bzr1-D), and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant bes1-D plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulating gene expression analysis. pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1-GFP plants were used for BZR1 subcellular localization study and ChIP-qPCR assays. Promoter-driven reporter seeds were kindly provided by Dr Wang at Carnegie Institution for Science, USA (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP, pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP, and 35S::BES1-GFP); Dr Laux at the University of Freiburg, Germany (pWOX5::GFP); Dr Benfey at Duke University, USA (pSCR::SCR-GFP); Dr Guilfoyle at University of Missouri, Columbia, USA (DR5::GFP and DR5::GUS); Dr Friml at Ghent University, Belgium (pPIN3::PIN3-GFP, pPIN4::PIN4-GFP, and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP); and Dr Scheres at Ultrecht University, The Netherlands (pCo2::YFP H2B, and J2341). The following plants were generated: bzr1-D x pWOX5::GFP, bzr1-D x pSCR::SCR-GFP, bzr1-D x pC O 2::YFP H2B, DR5::GFP x bzr1-D, and DR5::GFP x mx3 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP). These reporter seedlings were used to trace expression and behaviour of the fusion proteins under the confocal laser-scanning microscope.

These sterilized seeds were then sown on 1/2 MS agar medium containing 0.8% phytoagar (pH 5.7) in the presence or absence of the indicated chemicals. Plants were grown in a growth chamber operating under a cycle of 16h light and 8h dark at 23–25 °C with 70% humidity.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Staining and detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method of Jefferson (1987), with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90% acetone for 20min and infiltrated with staining buffer [0.1M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10mM EDTA, 2.5mM K4Fe(CN)6·3H20, and 1mg/ml X- GLUC]. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS-PI staining method. mPS-PI staining was performed according to the method of Truernit et al. (2008) with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described in Figs 2, 3 and 4). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and then incubated in 1% periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4g chloral hydrate, 1ml glycerol, and 2ml water) for 5min to observe fluorescence or reflection signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)Confocal microscopy PI, YFP/GFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488nm) and a He/Ne 1 ion laser (543nm). For observation of PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 543nm to collect the PI signal at 595–615nm or excited at 488nm to detect GFP signal at 493–545nm or YFP signal at 521–560nm. For observation of mPS-PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 488nm and the emission was collected at 520–720nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485–491nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software.Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from root tissues using the Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) and treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed by the SYBR green method using the Applied Biosystems Step One Plus System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The expression of each transcript was normalized against the amount of UBC1 control in each sample. CPD was used as a control for BR-repressed genes. The results were reported as expression relative to the Col-0 mock control (Figs 1G, 1H, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B) or Col-0 or En-2 genetic control (Figs 1I, 5C, and 6C). Three to five biological replicates were included in each experiment, and the data were statistically analysed using the Student’s t-test. Primers used for the qRT-PCRs are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 (available at JXB online). Fig. 6.

(A–C) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of root-controlling genes in BL-treated Col-0 and BR-related mutant plants. Plants were grown and expression of root-regulating genes was analysed for short-term BL-treated plants (A), long-term BL-treated plants (B), and BL-related mutants (C) as described in Fig. 1G–I. (D) ChIP-qPCR assay of the BZR1- and BES1- binding cis-motif of root-regulating genes. BZR1- and BES1-bound chromatin DNA fragments were isolated from roots of week-old Col-0, pBZR1::BZR1-YFP, and p35S::BES1-GFP plants using anti-BZR1 antibodies. Next, quantitative PCR analysis was performed with the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S2 as described in Materials and methods. Each primer set amplifies a region of the promoter simplified in Supplementary Figure S2 (available at JXB online) containing the BZR1-binding BRRE sequence (5′-CGTGT/CG-3′, He et al., 2005) and E-box (5′-CANNTG-3′, Yin et al., 2005). Promoters of UBC30 and PP2A genes were used as negative controls for BZR1- and BES1-binding motif. The promoter of DWF4 was used as a positive control (Sun et al., 2010). All ChIP-qPCR analysis was repeated with a minimum of triple biological replicates and the data were statistically analysed by the Student’s t-test.ChIP-qPCR assay ChIP experiments were performed as previously described with minor modifications (Gendrel et al., 2005) using the non-transgenic Columbia-0, plants expressing native promoter-driven BZR1-GFP (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP), and plants constitutively expressing BES1-GFP (p35S::BES1-GFP). In brief, week-old seedlings were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and the chromatin DNA fragments (~500bp in length) were isolated from their nuclei of root tissues to retrieve BZR1 or BES1-binding DNA fragments using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, UK). The bound DNA fragments were then extracted using the Gel/PCR DNA fragments extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Korea) and the amount of the bound DNA was measured by performing real-time PCRs with the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S2 (available at JXB online) using equal amounts of DNA from the input and the CoIP fractions.Results Both BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways stimulate mitotic reactivation of QC cells The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011; Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and results in CSC differentiation (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR-regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips of pBZR1:BZR1-YFP plants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) (Fig. 1A). It was found that, contrary to a previous report (Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014), supplying BL in the medium enhanced nuclear localization of BZR1 in the cells of the SCN area, so that concentrated nuclear expression was found in the root tip cells including the QC, cells above the QC, the CSC, and CCs (Fig. 1A). Similar localization of BZR1 was evident within 15min when BL was applied to 7-d-old seedlings (data not shown). This implies that not only the reported BES1- but also the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway may actively be involved in QC division and the distal CSC differentiation. To assess roles of the BZR1-mediated signalling pathway in these developmental processes, whether the BR and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway modulates the mitotically inactive status of the QC was investigated. Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M BL showed an increased frequency of mitotically activated QC cells, such that 58% of plants had two layers of QC cells with periclinal division by 7 d after germination (DAG) as determined by morphologic lineage (Fig. 1B). In comparison, 5% of untreated Col-0 plants harboured double layers of QC cells. Consistent with a previous report (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011), more than 80% of plants with the bes1-D BR-signalling enhancing mutation in an En-2 background showed reactivated QC cell layers by 7 DAG, increasing to 100% by 14 DAG (Fig 1B, C; Supplementary Table S3, available at JXB online). It was next examined whether BZR1-mediated BR signalling results in similar QC reactivation. It was found that the QC was also frequently reactivated in BR-signalling enhanced bzr1-D plants, such that two QC layers were observed in 50% of the plants by 7 DAG and in 75% of the plants by 14 DAG (Fig. 1B, C; Supplementary Table S3). This QC reactivation was less frequent than that in bes1-D plants, but was greatly enhanced compared with Col-0 and BR-signalling defective bri1-116 plants, which hardly ever showed QC division at 7 DAG. Introduction of bzr1-D clearly reactivated the QC of bri1-116 (divided QCs were present in 37% of the bri1-116/bzr1-D plants by 7 DAG and 69% by 14 DAG), which implies that BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling is actively involved in reactivation of QC division. WOX5 expression in the embryonic cell lineage leads to QC formation and is involved in maintaining the stem cell state in a non-autonomous manner (Haeker et al., 2004; Sarkar et al., 2007). It was demonstrated that the QC marker WOX5 was expressed in both divided QC cells while a cortex marker (pC O 2::YFP H2B, Heidstra et al., 2004), was unchanged in its expression pattern when these plants were grown on medium containing BL (Fig. 1D). SCARECROW (SCR) is required for specification of QC identity, stem cell homeostasis and asymmetric cell division (Sabatini et al., 2003; Moubayidin et al., 2013). In this study, the SCR reporter plants grown on medium containing BL reactivated QC cell division as determined by morphologic cell lineage but, unexpectedly, SCR protein accumulated predominantly in the upper QC in most BL-treated cells. To verify the effect of BR on QC division, bzr1-D was crossed with different cell-specific marker lines (Fig. 1D). For bzr1-D×pWOX5::GFP, 50% of the plants showed GFP expression in both the upper and lower cells of the QC whereas the other 50% showed expression only in the upper cell. In most bzr1-D×pSCR::GFP, the GFP signal was present only in the upper cell of the QC. This lack of WOX5 and SCR expression in the rootward QC cells may indicate an asymmetric QC division and loss of functional QC identity. Ethylene overexpressor 1 (ETO1) and CULLIN3 (CUL3) are a part of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that modulates the level of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 5 (ACS5) catalysing the rate-limiting step of ethylene biosynthesis. It was previously reported that the gain-of-function eto1-11 mutant overproduces ethylene and promotes QC cell division (Ortega-Martinez et al., 2007). In this regard, it was tested whether the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway interacts with ETO1-promoted ethylene pathway in the regulation of the QC cell division. bzr1-D plants grown for 8 DAG showed QC cell division at a frequency of 74% (Fig. 1E). Treatment of neither an ethylene action inhibitor AgNO3 nor biosynthetic inhibitors, aminoethoxy-vinylglycine (AVG) and CoCl2, interfered with this bzr1-D-induced QC cell division. Similarly, treatment of eto1-11 mutants with BRZ, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor (Asami et al., 2000), did not significantly influence the QC reactivation frequency of eto1-11 plants (Fig. 1F). Moreover, both eto1-11 genetic background provoking QC cell division at a frequency of 61% and treatment of BL inducing cell division at a frequency of 45% additively coordinated the promotion of QC cell reactivation, thus BL-treated eto1-11 plants showed two-layered reactivated QC cells at a frequency of 97%. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting BZR1-mediated QC reactivation, expression of WOX5, SCR, and SHR genes was significantly increased by both short-term (3h, Fig. 1G) and long-term (7 DAG, Fig. 1H) treatments of BL. Consistent with BR-induced up-regulation, their expression was significantly repressed in BR signalling-defective bri1-116 plants, but greatly increased in signalling-enhanced bzr1-D plants and bri1-116/bzr1-D double mutants (Fig. 1I). In addition, BL treatment greatly suppressed gene expression of BRAVO (a negative regulator of QC divisions; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and increased the expression of ERF115 (a positive regulator of QC division; Heyman et al., 2013) in both the short-term and long-term treated Col-0 plants (Fig. 1G, H). Again, their expression was tightly controlled in a BRI1/BZR1-mediated signalling-dependent manner (Fig. 1I). Expression of BRAVO and ERF115 was similarly regulated in bes1-D plants to those of bzr1-D plants. Expression of genes regulating ethylene biosynthesis was also examined, and it was found that expression of CUL3, ACS5, and ETO1 was not regulated by BR treatment nor was it different in bzr1-D or bes1-D plants compared with the Col-0 or En-2 plants, respectively (Fig 1G–I). These results support the conclusion that BRs promote QC cell division independently from the ethylene pathway.BRs apparently exert opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in a concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner Results presented thus far have shown that the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway was able to reactivate and produce multiple layers of the QC (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S3 available at JXB online). In addition, BL treatment greatly enhanced expression of a columella initial marker, J2341, and expanded its expression to the QC, CC, and other root tip cells (Fig. 1D). These observations, together with BL-induced intense nuclear localization of BZR1 in the QC, CSCs, and CCs (Fig. 1A), prompted an investigation of the effects of BR on the maintenance and differentiation of distal CSCs by examining the development of starch-accumulated columella cells. First, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was measured for Col-0 (Fig. 2A) and BR biosynthesis-defective de-etiolated2 (det2; Noguchi et al., 1999) (Fig. 2B) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 10−15 to 10−9 M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS-PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration-dependent manner in both Col-0 and det2 plants. Less than 10% of Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60% and 82% of Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M and 10−9 M, respectively, contained two layers of QC (Fig. 2A, D). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treatment. Most Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15% of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (25–30%) by the 10−15 M to 10−11 M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52% by the 10−10 M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57% seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43% with three layers of CCs (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 10−10 M BL showed 25% seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68% with three layers of CCs, and 7% with two layers of CCs. These concentration-dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL-treated det2 plants (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, treatment of Col-0 plants with a higher concentration of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development: it promoted CSC differentiation and the resulting CC development. Seventeen percent of Col-0 plants grown on 10−9 M BL had two layers of CSCs, which is far below the frequency compared with those of the plants grown on 10−15 M to 10−11 M of BL, and is about the same frequency as with mock-treated plants. Moreover, plants with no CSC (whose starch granules of cells resided underneath the QC were stained with PI) were present at a frequency of 18%, which was hardly observed in the mock- and lower BL-treated Col-0 plants (Fig. 2A, D). Consistent with this observation, an increased frequency of plants with a higher number of CC layers was observed in plants grown on medium containing 10−9 M BL than in plants grown with lower concentrations of BL. Similar observations were previously reported in Col-0 plants treated with 4×10−9 M BL and the bes1-D BR gain-of-function mutant (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in BL-treated det2 plants (Fig. 2B). Treatment of BR-deficient det2 plants with higher concentrations of BL further increased the number of CSC layers and dramatically decreased the number of CC layers accordingly. These results strongly indicate that BRs differentially regulate distal CSC differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner: they inhibit the stem cell differentiation at low concentrations and promote it at higher concentrations. In support of data presented here, Col-0 plants grown on media containing BK, an inhibitor of BIN2 (a negative regulator of the BR signalling pathway) (De Rybel et al, 2009) showed similar results to plants treated with lower concentrations of BL (data not shown). Also of note was that BL treatments not only modulated CSC differentiation, as determined by counting the number of cell layers stained with PI or below the stained cells, but also weakened the intensity of PI staining (Fig. 2D). At the extreme, most Col-0 plants treated with 10−9 M BL had 1–3 cells in the lowest layers that were not stained at all. This result implies that BR may be involved in starch development as well as differentiation of the distal meristem. Next, to investigate the BRI1/BZR1-dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR-related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011), bes1-D plants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation (Fig. 2C, E). Twenty percent of En-2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80% carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70% of bes1-D plants harboured two-layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion of bes1-D plants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52% of the bes1-D plants had single-layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83% of En-2 plants carried single-layered CSCs and the remaining 17% had two-layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in the bes1-D in that 16% of the plants had five layers, 39% four layers, and 45% three layers. In comparison, En-2 plants showed 3% with five-layered, 27% with four-layered, and the remaining 70% with three-layered CCs. Comparing Col-0 plants with bri1-116, bzr1-D, and bri1-116/bzr1-D plants, 17% of Col-0 plants had two-layered QCs and the remaining 83% showed single-layered QCs by 8 DAG on MS media (Fig. 2C, E). In the same population of Col-0 plants, it was found that 90% of plants carried single-layered CSCs and a half developed four-layered CCs while the other half developed five-layered CCs. In comparison, the frequency of plants with single-layered QCs and CSCs in a BR-signalling defective mutant was slightly increased so that 98% of the bri1-116 plants carried single-layered QC or CSC. This implies that a defective BR signalling pathway may result in retardation of QC or CSC cell division or differentiation. Development of CCs was also slightly inhibited compared with the Col-0 plants: 20% of bri1-116 plants had five-layered, 72% four-layered, and the remaining 8% had three-layered CCs. Interestingly, a similar trend of reduction in CC layers was also observed in the BRZ-treated Col plants (data not shown). A BR-signalling enhanced mutant, bzr1-D, showed an increased frequency of plants with two-layered QCs as expected (80% with two-layered and the remaining 20% with single-layered plants). In addition, the frequency of plants with two-layered CSCs also dramatically increased (45% with two-layered and the rest with single-layered plants) as seen in the case of BL-treated Col-0 plants. Concurrently, the frequency of plants with fewer CC layers in the bzr1-D mutant was greatly increased in that 32% of the plants had four CC layers and the remaining 68% had three-layered CCs. A double mutant of the BR signal pathway, bri1-116/bzr1-D, had a similar frequency of plants with QC layers to bzr1-D and an intermediate frequency of plants with CSC and CC layers between bri1-116 and bzr1-1D. These results imply that differentiation of CSC and the resulting development of CC are under the control of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, and that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, in opposition to BES1-mediated signalling, inhibits the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying development of starch-filled columella cells. In addition, it seems that a defect in either BR biosynthesis (in the case of BRZ-treated Col plants) or in the signalling pathway (in the case of bri1-116) show similar results to BL treatment and BZR1-mediated signal enhancement.BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts on the auxin pathway and shows an antagonistic effect on auxin-stimulated CSC differentiation The auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction of WOX5 transcription in the QC (Wang et al., 2005; Ding and Friml, 2010). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect of the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway involves interaction with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col-0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single-layered CSC and the remaining 10% of plants had two layers of CSCs (Fig. 3A, B). In the same population, 23% of the Col-0 plants had five- or six-layered, 64% had four-layered, and 13% had three-layered CCs. As reported previously (Ding and Friml, 2010), Col-0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single-layered CSCs in NAA-treated Col-0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52% from 90% in the untreated Col-0 plants. Moreover, 48% of the NAA-treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA-treated plants with more CC layers increased significantly: 30% of the auxin-treated plants carried six-layered CCs, 35% with five-layered, and the remaining 35% had four-layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO-IAA, Yoshimoto et al., 2012) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers compared with those of Col-0 plants. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts upstream of auxin in the regulation of CSC differentiation. (A) Effects of auxin-related chemicals on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Col-0 and bzr1-D plants. (B) Pictures of representative seedlings used for the cell layer measurement presented in (A). Seedlings were grown for 8 DAG on 1/2 MS agar media in the absence or presence of NAA (10−6 M) and PEO-IAA (2×10−5 M). The CSC and CC layers were identified as described in Fig. 2. n>50 seedlings for each treatment. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)It has been shown in BL-treated Col-0 and bzr1-D plants that the frequency of plants with a higher number of CSC layers was increased and the number of CC layers was decreased compared with those of Col plants (Figs 2A–C and 3A). However, NAA greatly negated the effects of the bzr1-D mutation, so that it led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of plants with fewer CSC layers and subsequent enhanced differentiation of CSC into CC layers, as in the case of Col-0 plants treated with the same chemicals (Fig. 3A, B). For example, 32% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried no CSC layer while only 6% of the untreated plants had no CSC layer. For CC layers, 58% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried five-layered CSCs while only 5% were observed in untreated plants. In addition, treatment of PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants slightly augmented the bzr1-D mutation effect, so that the frequency of plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers was slightly increased compared with the untreated bzr1-D plants. For example, 45% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried two-layered CSCs while 31% of the untreated plants had two-layered CSCs. For CC layers, 72% of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried four-layered CSCs while this was observed in 66% of the untreated plants. Nonetheless, it was noticed that treatment of NAA or PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants did not completely lead to frequencies of CSC and CC layers observed in Col-0 plants treated by the same auxin-related chemicals. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR regulation on CSC differentiation and the following CC development partly act on the auxin action antagonistically, and a part of BZR1-mediated BR regulation for these developments may act in parallel to auxin.BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expression/subcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed (Blilou et al., 2005). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem (Friml et al., 2002). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip using DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP plants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells (Fig. 4A, C), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls (Fig. 4B). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL (Fig. 4A). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10−10 M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10−10 M)-treated DR5::GUS seedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, the DR5::GFP expression domain in bzr1-D plants and mx3 transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form of BZR1 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP) moved to the proximal area (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, some DR5::GUS plants treated with 10−9 M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs (Fig. 4A). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL (Fig. 2A, D). As expected, the gradual expression of DR5::GUS and correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (Fig. 4C). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip. The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins (Grieneisen et al., 2007). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regulation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation (Friml et al., 2002; Blilou et al., 2005). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localization of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col-0 and PIN reporter plants for 3h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the expression of PINs in a concentration-dependent manner: treatment of Col-0 roots for a short period (3h) with BR at low concentration (5×10−10 M) greatly suppressed expression of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 genes whereas treatment with a higher concentration of BL (5×10−6 M) resulted in enhanced expression of PIN7 (Fig. 5A). A similar down-regulation of PIN gene expression was also observed for plants growing on a MS solid medium containing 5×10−10 M BL for a long period (7 DAG) (Fig. 5B). This regulation of PIN genes, especially for PIN4, was dependent on BRI1-/BZR1-mediated signalling pathways so that gene expression of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 was significantly enhanced in a bri1-116 background compared with the Col-0 plants. On the other hand, expression was significantly down-regulated (PIN4), slightly increased (PIN3) without statistical significance, or maintained at the Col-0 control level (PIN7) in bzr1-D plants (Fig. 5C). Moreover, up-regulation of the PIN genes by bri1-116 mutation was partly negated by the bzr1-D mutation background in bri1-116/bzr1-D double mutants. This bzr1-D down-regulation effect of PIN genes resembles exogenous BL treatment at lower concentrations. In contrast, PIN7 expression was greatly increased in bes1-D mutants, which resembles the gene expression in plants treated with a higher concentration of BL. These results are consistent with the observation that BR has opposing effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manners. Next, the PIN reporter plants were treated with BL, as done for the gene expression analysis, and PIN protein expression and subcellular localization was examined (Fig. 5D–F). Without BL treatment, PIN3-GFP protein of pPIN3::PIN3-GFP plants in this experimental condition accumulated in the cell membrane of CSC and CC1 to the CC3 with predominant expression in CC1 and CC2 (Fig. 5D, F; upper panel). In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (10−6 M) for 3h, the PIN3 expression domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3. At the same time, the characteristic plasma membrane-localized PIN3 pattern was gradually diminished, and PIN3 appeared in endosome- or vesicle-like internal structures (Fig. 5D) at a frequency of 25% in mock-treated plants, which jumped to 65% in the BL-treated plants (Fig. 5E). Finally, growing PIN3 reporter seedlings on medium supplemented with 10−10 M BL for 7 DAG resulted in a significant decrease in the number of PIN3 expression layers and intensity of the PIN3 protein expressed (Fig. 5F). For example, 44.4% of the reporter plants showed PIN3-GFP expression in >3 columella cell layers with high expression level while 27.8 % expressed in 1–2 columella cell layers with low expression intensity. In contrast, BL-treated plants displayed 36.8% of plants with expression in >3 columella cell layers with high or medium expression intensity, and 57.9% of plants showed expression in one columella cell layer with low expression intensity. PIN4-GFP protein showed a nonpolar localization mainly in the membrane of CC1 to CC3 with prominent basal accumulation (Fig. 5F; middle panels). PIN7-GFP protein showed a similar expression pattern with prominent expression in CC2 (Fig. 5F; lower panel). Similar to the BL-treated PIN3::PIN3-GFP plants, treatment of BL (10−10 M) to pPIN4::PIN4-GFP and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP plants for 7 DAG resulted in a reduction in expression layers and intensity of reporter proteins. In conclusion, the BR signalling pathway modulates PIN gene expression and protein localization, which may lead to proximal relocation of the auxin maximum in the root tip.BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1-dependent manner Transcriptional regulation of many protein factors plays an important role in the establishment, maintenance, and differentiation of the root apical meristem (reviewed in Lee et al., 2013). In this report, results have shown that BR-induced and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway regulates expression of several root-regulating genes including PINs and WOX5. To have a better understanding of how BR regulates CSC differentiation, transcriptional expression of other key root-regulating genes was examined in the presence or absence of BL. SOMBRERO (SMB) and FEZ proteins antagonistically regulate distal stem cell differentiation through transcriptional negative feedback regulation: FEZ promotes periclinal root cap-forming cell divisions and SMB negatively regulates FEZ activity, repressing stem cell-like divisions in the root cap daughter cells (Willemsen et al., 2008). Therefore, it was determined whether BR regulates expression of SMB and FEZ and whether the mode of this regulation is opposite for these genes. In Col-0 plants, BL up-regulated SMB expression whereas it down-regulated FEZ expression for short- and long-treatment with both low and high concentrations of BL (Fig. 6A, B). In bri1-116 plants, SMB expression was down-regulated but recovered to the level of Col-0 plants by introducing a bzr1-D mutation (bri1-116/bzr1-D, Fig. 6C). Given the fact that the smb-3 mutant has more CC layers and fez-2 has fewer CC layers (Willemsen et al., 2008), these results indicate that the BR-induced up-regulation of SMB and down-regulation of FEZ may contribute to the BR-induced and BZR1-mediated suppression of CSC differentiation. In support of this idea, FEZ expression was significantly down-regulated in bzr1-D plants. BEARSKIN 1 (BRN1) and BRN2, together with SMB, directly activate transcription of both vascular nac domain (VND) and nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor (NST) to regulate cell maturation in the root cap, which undergoes terminal differentiation and detachment from the root (Bennett et al., 2010). The results showed that BR up-regulated BRN2 expression in Col-0 plants during both short- and long-term treatment, and that this was under the control of BRI1/BZR1-mediated gene expression (Fig. 6A–C). The expression of BRN1 in Col-0 plants was not significantly changed by short-term treatment of BL, but was slightly decreased by prolonged treatment with 5×10−10 M of BL. Interestingly, its expression was enhanced in bes1-D plants. Further studies are needed to carefully analyse how this regulation of gene expression is linked to BR- and BZR1-mediated root cap maturation. Since BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1 or BES1-dependent manner in this system, it was tested whether BZR1 or BES1 binds to the promoter of these genes in vivo by performing ChIP-qPCR analysis using pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1-GFP plants. It was found that BRAVO and ERF115 contain at least one or two BZR1 and/or BES1-binding motifs in their promoter regions (Fig. 6D), and this is consistent with the previous result showing that their expression was tightly controlled by BRI1/BZR1-mediated signalling (Fig. 1I). PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 genes contain at least one BZR1- and BES1-binding motif, and these results are strongly supported by a previous report demonstrating that BZR1 may bind to PIN3, PIN4, PIN7 as evidenced by ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip) performed using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the BZR1-CFP protein from the BZR1 promoter (Sun et al., 2010). The BRN1 gene had at least one BZR1 and BES1-binding motif (Fig. 6D), but their effect on gene expression was different from each other (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data indicate that BR-induced nuclear BZR1 regulates expression of several key root-controlling genes by binding to their promoters, which may be resulting in BR-induced modulation of root stem cell division and differentiation in the root tip area including columella cell layers.Discussion A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short-range non-cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state (van den Berg et al., 1997; Scheres, 2007). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (see Supplementary Figure S3 at JXB online for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down-regulating expression of BRAVO repressor while at the same time up-regulating ERF115, a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1-/BES1- and BL dose-dependent. The BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch-filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011). Similarly, application of low concentrations of exogenous BL (~ ≤10−10 M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, while higher concentrations of BL (≥10−9 M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling. Similarly, bes1-D seedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark- and light-grown conditions (Yin et al., 2002) whereas bzr1-D seedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light (Wang et al., 2002). It has also been reported that BES1 acts as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor (He et al., 2005; Yin et al., 2005). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1-/BES1-dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration-dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC-regulating genes, such as FEZ and BRN1, seem to be differentially regulated in bzr1-D and bes1-D plants. BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development (Lee et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013 for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport (Bao et al., 2004), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). Transcript profiling and ChIP-chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signalling (Sun et al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that BRs down-regulate transcriptional expression of PINs and change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation of PIN genes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Epidermis-driven BR signalling and activity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele-localized PINs (PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7) (Hacham et al., 2011), but modulates transcriptional expression of PIN2 and PIN4 and their accumulation in the epidermis/cortex and columella in a post-transcriptional manner (Hacham et al., 2012). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR-directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR-mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink-driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin-driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss-of-function mutant Atpin4 exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling (Friml et al., 2002). Recent studies showed that auxin-induced repression of WOX5 results in enhanced CSC differentiation (Ding and Friml, 2010). The BL-treated plants and bzr1-D plants with enhanced BR signalling used here exhibited a decreased level of auxin in the distal root area and increased expression of WOX5. Concomitantly, they exhibited reactivated QCs, an increased number of undifferentiated CSC layers, and a corresponding decreased number of columella cell layers. In summary, these findings indicate that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibits auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation in Arabidopsis roots through action that is antagonistic to the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. It is also possible that BR-driven nuclear BZR1 directly binds to the promoter of root-regulating genes such as PINs, BRAVO, ERF115, FEZ, and BRN1, and independently regulates QC division and the distal stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of WOX5 and thus maintains quiescence of the QC and suppresses differentiation of the columella initials (Zhang et al., 2010). This phenomenon of ABA-induced WOX5 expression and promotion of stem cell maintenance is opposite to the BZR1-mediated WOX5 induction and reactivation of QC division in root tips that was observed in this study. Based on these apparently contradictory reports, it is highly plausible that differential regulation or mode of action of each hormone is involved in multiple cellular processes in distinctive root tissues or cell types, such as the QC, CSC, and CC. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify their mode of action and interactomes by dissecting details of these regulatory frameworks and establishing their interaction with other hormones. It has been demonstrated that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting this observation, treatment of ethylene biosynthetic precursor ACC promoted QC division without promoting BZR1 nuclear accumulation in the QC (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell-type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated (Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dissect the connections among the dose-dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling molecules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF-binding DR5-based auxin-inducible reporter (Ulmasov et al., 1997; Barbez et al., 2013) and an Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor (DII-VENUS; Brunoud et al., 2012) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolution in a single-cell-based tobacco system and in planta. Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR-regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understanding of BR-regulated meristem function in plants.Supplementary material Supplementary data are available at JXB online.

Copyright notice ID: 4349987 PMID: 25587034 Abstract To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress. Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress (HS)1 by all living organisms. When exposed to high temperature, plants have sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis and minimize cell damage. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) mediate gene expression changes leading to the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that confer thermotolerance to plants (1, 2, 3). In recent years, there has been considerable progress in identifying the signaling steps that enable plants to respond to heat stress at the molecular level. These include: activation of bZIP transcription factors by heat-induced proteolytic cleavage (4); inhibition of transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) (5); accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by RBOHD activation (6); and reduced H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes of heat-regulated genes, which would be expected to stimulate transcription of these genes (7). Many reports also provide evidence that membrane-localized calcium channels can act as sensors for increased temperature in plant cells (8, 9). The increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) caused by calcium influx from the extracellular matrix is an early critical step in the HS signal transduction pathway (10). In responding to this calcium influx, calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin and calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are activated. Calmodulin binds to a calmodulin-binding protein kinase, which in turn, activates heat-regulated changes in gene expression by phosphorylating HSF (11, 12, 13). CDPKs, on the other hand, might regulate plant heat-shock responses by activating multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (14). Despite considerable progress in studying the mechanisms of heat-shock signal transduction, our understanding of the heat signal perception and early signaling transduction mechanism is still very limited. Therefore, identifying novel proteins that regulate early heat-shock responses should help decoding high-temperature sensing and responding mechanism in planta. Along with advances in genome sequencing, new proteomic technologies have now emerged as an important tool in studying signal transduction mechanisms (15). Compared with traditional genetic studies, which rely on phenotypes caused by altering gene activity, proteomics not only provides real-time monitoring of abundance changes of certain proteins during cell and tissue responses to stimuli, but also reveals their mechanisms of function and regulation, such as post-translational modifications and protein–protein interaction. In this study, we used the two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) technology to find microsome-associated proteins whose level changes rapidly after heat-shock, and identified a set of membrane proteins that change abundance in response to a five-minute heat treatment. Among these proteins was annexin 1 (AtANN1), and here we demonstrate that this protein plays a key role in plant heat-stress responses by mediating a heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plant Materials and Heat Shock Treatment Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized using 75% (v/v) ethanol and sowed in glass plates containing 25 ml growth medium containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) salt, 1.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Plates were stratified at 4 °C in darkness for 3 days. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 22 °C under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) for 1 week. For heat shock treatment, the glass plates were wrapped with general kitchen plastic wrap and submerged in a water bath at the indicated temperature for different periods. The seedlings were returned to 22 °C under long-day to recover for 1 week before taking pictures for analysis. All the data showed in this study has been performed at least three times with similar results. Representative data from one repetition are shown in the figures.2D-DIGE Protein Sample Preparation Because we were interested in finding heat shock-regulated proteins whose level changed rapidly, we used a water bath for our heat shock proteomic studies to make sure all the seedlings were instantly subjected to similar temperature at same time. To prepare the seedlings for 2D-DIGE protein sample extraction, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in liquid medium containing 1/2 MS salt and 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under long day at 22 °C for 1 week. To avoid a nutrient shock effect, half of the old medium was transferred into a new container and incubated at 37 °C in the water bath, whereas the other half of the medium was kept at 22 °C with the seedlings. When the temperature of the water bath medium reached 37 °C, half of the seedlings were transferred into the medium to initiate the heat shock treatment. After heat shock treatment for 5 min, seedlings were harvested by filtering through a nylon mesh, quick tap-dried with tissue paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomal proteins were extracted as described previously (16), and dissolved in DIGE buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS) at a concentration around 5–10 μg/μl.2D-DIGE Procedure and Image Analysis Protein for 2D-DIGE analysis was labeled with CyDyeTM DIGE fluor minimal labeling kit (GE Healthcare). In brief, 10 μl microsomal protein from control or heat treated sample was mixed with 0.25 μl of Tris-HCl (1.5 m, pH 8.8) and 0.5 μl of 100 nm Cy3 or Cy5, respectively, and incubated in darkness at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl 10 mm lysine and incubating with the protein on ice for 10 min. The Cy3- and Cy5- labeled pair of control and heat treated samples were combined, and to the mix was added 9 μl of 1 m DTT, 4.5 μl of IPG buffer, pH 4–7. One hundred-micrograms of unlabeled protein each from control and heat-treated samples was then added to make the total protein amount in the mixture around 300 μg. The DIGE buffer was used to adjust the final volume to 450 μl for separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using 24 cm Immobiline Dry Strips, pH 4–7. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to (16). DIGE images were acquired using a Typhoon trio scanner (GE healthcare). At least six biological repeats were performed, and labeling of two pairs of biological repeat samples was swapped to avoid identifying proteins that are preferentially labeled by a specific CyDye. Spots that showed consistent heat shock regulated changes in at least five biological repeat samples were picked using a robotic spot picker (GE healthcare).Protein In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Identification Protein in-gel digestion was performed as described previously (17). Extracted peptides in 0.1% formic acid were separated using a 100 μm ×150 mm C18 reverse phase column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350 nl/min, and eluted using a linear acetonitrile (ACN) gradient (0–45%) with 0.1% formic acid over 60 min using a nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into a LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an uncoated 15 μm inner diameter spraying needle with 2.1 kV electrospray voltage at 220 °C. Peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode with m/z range between 400 and 2000. Charged peaks over 1000 counts were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% normalized collision energy and activation Q value was set to 0.25. The dynamic exclusion activation time was set to 30 s to prevent same m/z ions from being selected after its acquisition. CID product ions were analyzed on the linear ion trap in centroid mode. Complete LC-MS/MS peak lists were searched against database generated from Arabidopsis subset of the nr database (date 12/12/2012, 257,035 entries searched), using the SEQUEST search algorithm, which is part of the BioWorks 3.3.1 data analysis software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide mass range was set to 400–5000 amu. The precursor ions' tolerance and fragment ions' tolerance were set to 2.00 amu and 1.00 amu, respectively. Enzymatic digestion was specified as trypsin, with a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was allowed as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation were allowed as variable modification. Search result option filter was set as the following: Delta CN ≥ 0.1; Xcorr (±1, 2, 3) = 1.75, 2.5, 3.0; peptide probability≤0.01.Isolation of Annexin T-DNA Mutants T-DNA insertional mutant for AtANN1 (SALK_132169, SAIK_414_C01, WiscDsLox477–480P11), AtANN2 (SALK_054223) and AtANN6 (SALK_112492) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org), and are all in Columbia (Col-0) background. The identified ann1–2 mutant was used to cross with ann2 mutant. F3 segregated ann1–2/ann2 double homozygous mutant were used for heat stress tolerance analysis. The gene specific primers used for genotyping the mutants were: 5′-gcctgcttcagcttttgtatg-3′ (left) and 5′-aacgctaccgacacaacattc-3′ (right) for SALK_132169; 5′-tgctccttctgatgatgctg-3′ (left) and 5′-ccaataaagcatcacgctca-3′ (right) for SAIL_414_C01; 5′-tggactcttgatccaccaga-3′ (left) and 5′-gagcaacaagcatgtcctca-3′ (right) for SALK_054223; 5′-ggcgtctctcaaaattccag-3′ (left) and 5′-caccagaaagctctccgtct-3′ (right) for SALK_112492. The transcript abundance of AtANN1 and AtANN2 in wild type and mutant seedlings was determined by semi-quantitative Reverse transcription PCR using 5′-atggcgactcttaaggtttc-3′ (left) and 5′-agcatcatcttcaccgagaag-3′ (right) for AtANN1 and gene specific genotyping primer set for SALK_054223 and SALK_112492.Plasmid Construction and Transformation Full-length CDS of AtANN1 were amplified by PCR, cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and subcloned into Gateway compatible binary vector pEarleyGate 100 by LR clonase (Invitrogen). The construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation and transformed into Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype) by the floral dipping method. Transgenic plants were selected by spraying plants with 5 μg/ml Basta (Finale). All transgenic lines used in this study are single insertional homozygous T3 lines.Expression Analysis of HSFs and HSPs by RT-PCR and Western Blot Wild type and ann1–2/ann2 double mutant seedlings were grown in the same glass plates containing 15 ml growth medium (1/2 MS salt, 1.5% sucrose, and 0.8% agar) for 1 week at 22 °C under long-day condition. For heat shock treatment, the plates were placed into a growth chamber with temperature set at 37 °C. Seedlings were harvested at different time intervals and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RT-PCR analysis of the expression level of various HSFs transcript, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using ExScriptTM RT reagent kit (Takara) according to manufacturer's instruction. Primer pairs used for RT-PCR analysis were: 5′-atgatgaacccgtttctcccggaag-3′ and 5′-ggaggtggaagccaaactctcatcac-3′ for HSF A7A; 5′-atggaagaactgaaagtggaaat-3′ and 5′-aggttccgaaccaagaaaacccatt-3′ for HSF A2; 5′-atgacggctgtgacggcggcgcaaag-3′ and 5′-gttgcagactttgctgcttttccac-3′ for HSF B1; 5′-acagatttcgctaaagatttgctt-3′ and 5′-cgcttcttcttcttcttcaatctc-3′ for HSF B2A. For protein abundance analysis of HSPs, frozen tissues were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen, boiled with 2× SDS sampling buffer, loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with different antibodies specifically against various HSPs (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) and detected with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce).Ca2+ Measurement Using Aequorin Aequorin luminescence measurement was performed according to (18), with slight modifications. Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing cytosolic 35S::Aequorin were grown in 1/2 MS salt containing medium for 10 days under long day at 22 °C. Seedlings (n ≥ 15 per treatment) were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated in dark with a calcium-measurement buffer (0.1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MES, 5 μm coelenterazine-h) at 22 °C for 6 h. The seedlings were quick rinsed two times with the calcium-measurement buffer, 100 μl 22 °C (control) or 37 °C (heat shock) calcium measurement buffer was quickly added to each well, and the plate was loaded into a microplate luminometer (Centro LB 960, Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN) that is at room temperature (control) or has been prewarmed to 37 °C (heat shock). Aequorin luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 0.5 s every 30 s. After 45 counts, 100 μl reconstitution solution (2 m CaCl2, 20% ethanol) was injected and luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 10 more cycles, 0.5 s each. Percentage reconstitution value was calculated by dividing the luminescence signal recorded at each time point by the highest reconstitution luminescence value recorded in each well, respectively, for wild type, ann1 and ann1/2 mutants. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37 °C by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22 °C.Determination of Total Ca2+ in Plant Tissues Fifty seven-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in 1/2 MS medium supplied with 1% sucrose were grouped as one sample and oven dried at 65 °C overnight. After recording the dry weights, the dried plants were digested with 5 ml HNO3 at 100 °C for 4 h. The digested mixture was transferred to a volumetric flask, and diluted precisely to 100 ml with double distilled water. Total plant Ca2+ concentration was determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotomer (Model AA-240Z, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).RESULTS The Effect of HS Temperature and Duration on the Survival of Arabidopsis Seedlings Increased environmental temperature triggers heat-shock responses (HSR) in plants; however, if the temperature rises above a certain limit, or the duration of the high temperature is too long, plants will not be able to survive. To study the HS response of plant cells, the treatment used should be strong enough to stimulate the HSR, but at the same time mild enough not to kill the plant. In order to find a proper heat-shock treatment condition for our proteomic studies, plates containing one-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were treated at a range of temperatures and treatment durations, and post-treatment survival rates were calculated after the seedlings recovered at 22 °C for 1 week. Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings in a 42 °C water bath up to 10 min did not induce irreversible damage to seedlings, whereas treatment with a 42 °C water bath for 30 min killed almost all of the seedlings. In comparison, seedlings treated with a 37 °C water bath for 30 min survived (Fig. 1). As 37 °C has been previously shown to induce HSR (9, 11, 12), a 37 °C water bath was used as our treatment temperature during the following proteomic studies. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The effect of heat shock temperature and duration on the survival of Arabidopsis seedlings. One-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were heat shock treated at different temperatures for the indicated time period and allowed to recover at 22 °C for 7 days before taking pictures for comparison.Identification of Microsomal Proteins Whose Level Changes Rapidly After Heat Shock Heat shock stimulates a rapid increase of the [Ca2+]cyt. This increase can be seen as early as 1 min after heat treatment, and reaches the maximum around 5 mins (11). In order to study the early cellular responses stimulated by HS, we exposed one-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings to 37 °C for 5 mins and harvested them for 2D-DIGE analysis. Protein samples from control and treated seedlings were analyzed in at least six biological-repeat experiments. In average, over 1500 protein spots were detected in each gel (Fig. 2A). Examination of the DIGE images identified over 49 spots that showed consistent abundance changes induced by heat shock. Surprisingly, the abundance of most spots was increased by heat treatment, and only a few showed decreased levels. These spots of interest were picked, digested in gel by trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A total of 27 heat-shock-regulated protein spots, which represented 19 unique proteins, were successfully identified (Table I). Functional classification showed these proteins are involved in processes such as hormone biosynthesis, protein translation, calcium signaling, cellular metabolism, and protein folding (chaperone). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab 2D DIGE analysis of heat-regulated microsomal proteins identified AtANN1 as an early heat-responsive protein. A, Microsomal protein from Col-0 seedlings treated with 37 °C for 5 min was labeled with Cy5, and microsomal protein from untreated seedlings was labeled with Cy3. The proteins were then separated using 24 cm, pH 4–7, IPG strips and a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.

Using polyclonal antibody raised specific against a 31 amino acid sequence from AtANN1 (amino acids 200–231) (19), we confirmed the 2D-DIGE result in which AtANN1 protein levels increased in the microsomal fraction after 5 mins of HS (Fig. 2C). We then isolated Transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants of AtANN1 gene to investigate if AtANN1 plays a significant role in HS responses in Arabidopsis. We obtained three insertion mutants for AtANN1, and these alleles were named as ann1–1 (SalK_132169), ann1–2 (Sail_414_C01), and ann1–3 (WiscDsLox477–480P11; Fig. 3A). The T-DNA insertion sites in these alleles were located at the 5′ UTR of the AtANN1 gene (ann1–1) or within different positions of its second and third exon (ann1–2 and ann1–3), respectively (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of these T-DNA mutants showed that the expression of AtANN1 in ann1–2 and ann1–3 is not detectable, whereas the expression of AtANN1 in ann1–1 was not affected (Fig. 3B). We then compared the basal thermotolerance of these T-DNA insertional mutants with wild-type seedlings. One-week-old seedlings were subjected to 45 °C water bath for 13 min, and then allowed to recover at 22 °C for another week before they were photographed and calculate their survival rate. Consistent with the expression of endogenous AtANN1 level, ann1–2 and ann1–3 seedlings were hypersensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas heat sensitivity of ann1–1 seedlings was similar to wild-type plants (Fig. 3C, 3D).

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AtANN1, AtANN2, and AtANN6 are all closely related, with AtANN2 and AtANN6 having 75% identity at the amino acid level (20). There is expression and immunolocalization evidence suggesting that AtANN1 and AtANN2 have both distinct and overlapping functions in Arabidopsis (21, 22). To investigate if other annexins also participate in plant HS responses, we isolated T-DNA insertion mutants for AtANN2 and AtANN6 and tested basal thermotolerance of the mutant seedlings (Fig. 4A, 4B). The sensitivity of ann2 mutants to heat-shock treatment is higher than wild type but lower than ann1–2 mutants (Fig. 4C). In contrast, knocking out the expression of AtANN6 did not alter the sensitivity of the mutant to heat-shock treatment (Fig. 4C). We then generated an ann1–2/ann2 double mutant by crossing ann2 with ann1–2, and found the ann1–2/ann2 double mutant seedlings were more sensitive to heat stress treatment than the ann1–2 single mutants. These results indicated AtANN1 and AtANN2, but not AtANN6, play redundant roles in regulating plant heat-shock responses. Fig. 4.

Scale bar represents 1 cm.Heat Stress-Induced Expression of HSF and HSP is Impaired in ann1/2 Mutant Heat stress-induced expression of HSFs and HSPs plays an important role in the acquisition of thermotolerance by plants. To investigate whether the susceptibility of annexin mutants to heat stress is related to the level of endogenous HSFs and HSPs, the heat-induced expression of different HSFs and HSPs were analyzed in seedlings of wild type and ann1–2/ann2 double mutants. Under normal conditions, expression of HSFs is either not detected or at a similar level in both wild type and ann1–2/ann2 double mutants. Thirty minutes of heat shock induces a dramatic increase of HSFs expression in wild-type seedlings. In comparison, the increase in expression of HSFs in ann1–2/ann2 double mutants is much smaller (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed for the expression of HSPs. Before heat-shock treatment, the protein levels of the HSP70, HSP90, and HSP17.7 in ann1–2/ann2 double mutants were similar to wild type. After heat shock at 37 °C for 3 h, the protein abundance of these three proteins in wild-type seedlings was significantly higher than in those of the ann1–2/ann2 mutants (Fig. 5B). The reduced expression of HSFs and HSPs in ann1–2/ann2 mutants after heat treatment suggests annexin is required for the early changes in gene expression induced by heat shock. Fig. 5.

Rubisco large subunit stained by Ponceau S is shown as the equal-loading control.Plants Overexpressing AtANN1 are more Resistant to Heat-Shock Treatment To further confirm the function of annexin in plants' heat-shock response, we overexpressed AtANN1 in ann1–2 mutant background. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression level of AtANN1 in two transgenic lines, OX-1 and OX-2, were both higher than in wild type. Seedlings overexpressing AtANN1 were more resistant to heat-shock treatment than wild-type seedlings. The average survival rate of annexin-overexpressing seedlings was 20% higher than wild-type seedlings, and the difference is statistically significant (Fig. 6). This result demonstrates that the expression level of annexin is directly related to the basal thermotolerance of young Arabidopsis seedlings. Fig. 6.

Error bars represent ±S.D.Suppressing the Expression of AtANN1 and AtANN2 Inhibits Heat-Shock-Induced Increase in Intracellular Calcium Levels Prior reports indicated that AtANN1 could function to increase the Ca2+ permeability of plasma membranes during plant stress responses (23, 24). In order to test whether heat-induced calcium transport is altered in AtANN1 loss-of-function mutants, we crossed the ann1–2 and ann1–2/ann2 mutants with transgenic plants expressing 35S::Aequorin (25), F3 segregant lines that were homozygous for 35S::Aequorin/ann1–2 and 35S::Aequorin/ann1–2/ann2 mutants were chosen and used for monitoring heat shock stimulated changes in [Ca2+]cyt. RT-PCR showed the expression of AtANN1 and AtANN2 is not detectable in our 35S::Aequorin expressing ann1–2/ann2 double knockout mutant (Fig. 7A). Measurement of cytosolic calcium concentration showed the highest luminescence signal emitted by reconstituted aequorin is lower in 35S::Aequorin expressing ann1–2 and ann1–2/ann2 mutants (Fig. 7B), which might be caused by the lower total calcium abundance in the seedlings (Fig. 7C). Because there is a difference in the reconstituted luminescence signals observed between wild type and the mutants, we used percentage reconstitution values to determine the relative luminescence in response to heat-shock treatment for wild type and mutants seedlings. As shown in Fig. 7D, in consistent with previous reports (11), heat-shock treatment induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt within 5 min in wild type, ann1–2, and ann1–2/ann2 mutants. The heat induced [Ca2+]cyt continues to increase in wild type and reaches the highest peak around 12 min. In comparison, this prolonged increase in the heat induced [Ca2+]cyt was diminished in ann1–2 mutant and absent in ann1–2/ann2 double mutant (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that AtANN1 and AtANN2 function is important for the normal heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt in Arabidopsis. Fig. 7.

D, Time-course measurement of aequorin signal in wild type, ann1 and ann1/2 mutants. Seedlings were treated with or without heat shock. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37 °C by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22 °C. These experiments have been repeated at least three times, and the trends are similar. Data shown here is from one representative experiment.DISCUSSION The heat-induced rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt is considered to be an essential step in plant responses to heat stress. Prior reports showed this increase is regulated by plasma membrane-localized cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) (8, 9) and phospholipase C9 (PLC9) (26), but there may be other calcium channels or membrane-localized proteins involved in regulating this rapid and dynamic change in [Ca2+]cyt in response to HS treatment. Because of prior studies showing that AtANN1 promoted the Ca2+ permeability of plasma membranes, we selected it for further study from the microsomal proteins in Arabidopsis seedlings whose level changed rapidly after heat shock. We found that AtANN1 plays an important role in regulating heat-shock tolerance in Arabidopsis seedlings and that seedlings knocked out in their expression of AtANN1 show impaired calcium influx in response to heat-shock treatment. These results suggest AtANN1 is a new component in regulating heat-shock-induced elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in plant cells. Annexins bind membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Although they appear to have diverse functions, it has become clear that certain annexins play important roles in abiotic stress responses (20, 27). For example, ectopic expression of a Brassica annexin in Arabidopsis provides tolerance to drought, salinity and osmotic stress (28), and overexpression of AtANN1 in Arabidopsis increases both drought tolerance in plants (29), and salinity tolerance in seeds (30). There are also previous studies linking annexins to heat-stress responses in plants. For example, a recent proteomic study analyzing heat stress in radish leaves found that the level of an annexin protein increased at 12 h, and then decreased at 24 h in response to 40 °C heat treatment (31). Chu et al. also identified an annexin protein from the embryonic axes of sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) that was up-regulated by heat treatment. Ectopic expression of this lotus annexin in Arabidopsis conferred resistance to heat treatment in seed germination (32). In this study, we discovered that Arabidopsis AtANN1 is an early participant in a plant's response to heat treatment. The increase in abundance of AtANN1 in the microsomal membrane fraction can be observed after only 5 min of heat treatment. Among the eight annexins in the Arabidopsis genome, AtANN1 is the most abundant and appears to be a multifunctional protein (33). We found that knocking out the expression of either endogenous AtANN1 or AtANN2 makes mutants hypersensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas knocking out the expression AtANN6 does not alter the sensitivity of the mutant, indicating AtANN1 and AtANN2, but not AtANN6, are functionally redundant in regulating plant basal thermotolerance. Correspondingly, Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing AtANN1 were more resistant to heat stress. Furthermore, heat induced expression of HSFs and HSPs is attenuated in ann1–2/ann2 double mutant. Taken together, these results suggest AtANN1 and AtANN2 are critical components of plants' adaptive responses to environmental heat stress. There are numerous reports documenting AtANN1 functions as a calcium-permeable channel-like protein in response to abiotic stress, but most of the data was obtained from patch clamp experiments of spheroplasts and protoplasts of root epidermal cells (23, 24, 34). Here, using an aequorin reporting system, we found AtANN1 and AtANN2 play a role in regulating the elevation of [Ca2+]cyt induced by heat shock in whole seedlings. We found that heat-induced change in [Ca2+]cyt was greatly reduced in ann1 mutant and was even lower in ann1–2/ann2 double mutant, which suggests that AtANN1 and AtANN2 are important components of the channel transport system that regulates heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. However, heat shock still induces a small increase in [Ca2+]cyt in the ann1–2/ann2 double mutant, especially in the first 5 min of heat shock treatment, which might be caused by the function of other proteins that facilitate Ca2+ uptake, such as CNGCs in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, the total calcium concentration in ann1 and ann1/2 mutant seedlings is lower than wild-type control seedlings. However, future studies are needed to determine whether the reduced calcium accumulation is caused by the reduced calcium influx in ann1 and ann1/2 mutants. In conclusion, we found that the abundance of AtANN1 protein in membranes increased rapidly in response to 5 min heat-shock treatment, and that AtANN1 is critical for plant heat-shock responses. Although it is still unresolved whether AtANN1 acts directly as a calcium-permeable channel in vivo or facilitates this calcium transport by some other mechanism (35, 36, 37), our results strongly suggest that in addition to previously characterized calcium-permeable channels, annexins are a significant component of the molecular machinery that promotes the heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. However, our data provide no evidence that AtANN1 functions as a heat sensor during plant heat-shock responses. Consequently, we propose that an elevated environmental temperature is first perceived by membrane sensors like CNGCs, which allows for an initial calcium influx into the cytosol. This increased [Ca2+]cyt would activate cytosolic AtANN1, recruiting it directly to membranes. The association of AtANN1 with membranes could then either form a calcium channel by itself or activate another calcium channel to allow more calcium influx into the cell needed to fully activate plant heat-shock responses.Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Xiaodong Xu (Hebei Normal University, China) for providing 35S::Aequorin expressing transgenic plants.

    "abstract": "Summary A previous study has demonstrated that the treatment of Arabidopsis plants with chemical inhibitors of apyrase enzymes increases their sensitivity to herbicides. In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide‐potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.

    "introduction": "Introduction Fungal pathogens cause devastating losses of crops and postharvest fruits worldwide (Chen et al., 2008). Many chemical fungicides have been used in high doses and frequent intervals to prevent these losses by killing different fungal species. The global market for fungicides was estimated to be over $7.4 billion in 2005 (Morton and Staub, 2008) and is expected to rise to over $20 billion by 2017 (Israel, 2013). To reduce the risk of crop disease and enhance the safety of food, new effective fungicides or strategies to increase the potency of current fungicides need to be developed. One limitation to the potency of fungicides is their rapid detoxification by fungi via their sequestration or export across the plasma membrane. Fungi use diverse cellular mechanisms for the export of xenobiotics. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, together with major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters, are the most extensively studied families of transporters involved in fungal efflux mechanisms (Perlin et al., 2014). ABC and MFS multidrug transporters promote fungicide resistance in plant‐pathogenic fungi. In the grey mould Botrytis cinerea, the ABC transporter BcatrD acts synergistically with the MFS transporter Bcmfs1 to mediate sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance (Hayashi et al., 2001, 2002). In addition, in B. cinerea, an ABC transporter is important for the detoxification of the plant fungitoxin camalexin, which is secreted by Arabidopsis in response to abiotic and biotic stress (Stefanato et al., 2009). Further, an ABC transporter (BcatrB) in B. cinerea is up‐regulated by treatment with the grapevine phytoalexin resveratrol and the fungicide fenpiclonil (Schoonbeek et al., 2001). Consistent with these findings, a B. cinerea ABC transporter mutant (ΔBcatrB) shows increased sensitivity to resveratrol and fenpiclonil during its infection of grapevine, suggesting that BcatrB provides protection against the activity of plant defence compounds and fungicides in B. cinerea. Chemical agents that inhibit the activity of ABC transporters help prevent the disease caused by growth of the pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola on wheat seedlings, although these agents do not synergize the effectiveness of the fungicide cyproconazole (Roohparvar et al., 2007). More recently, another fungal ABC transporter protein has been shown to play a role in providing resistance to fungicides in Clonostchys rosea (Dubey et al., 2014). Any inhibition of the fungal toxin efflux mechanism would increase the potency of fungicides. For example, in the citrus green mould Penicillium digitatum, disruption of the ABC transporter gene PMRI causes a loss of DMI resistance. The effect of blocking transporter activity on fungal resistance to fungicides was also explored by Reimann and Deising (2005). They used confocal fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide stains to indirectly evaluate the resistance of fungi to the fungicide azoxystrobin after the application of a transport inhibitor. They first documented that plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence in stained Pyrenophora tritici‐repentis results from energy‐dependent efflux transporter activity. Then, they found that the addition of the NG5‐13a transporter inhibitor eliminated plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence. The addition of this compound to fungicides allowed chemical control of fungicide‐resistant isolates of the wheat fungal pathogen. These results provide indirect evidence that efflux transporters contribute to fungicide resistance in P. tritici‐repentis. Other authors have also noted that ABC transporters play a key role in aiding the resistance of pathogenic fungi to fungicides by exporting fungicides (e.g. Coleman and Mylonakis, 2009; Kretschmer et al., 2009; Perlin et al., 2014; Sang et al., 2015). Plants also detoxify xenobiotics by exporting them, and a previous report has documented that overexpression of either an ABCB1 homologue (AtPgp1) or an apyrase (NTPDase) enzyme (AtAPY1) confers multiherbicide resistance to Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Windsor et al., 2003). Furthermore, inhibitors of apyrase enzyme activity suppress the ability of plants to export herbicides and thus increase their sensitivity to these toxins (Windsor et al., 2003). Consistent with these findings are the results of Liu et al. (2012), who showed that genetic suppression of apyrase expression decreased the transport of the growth hormone auxin, a process known to be dependent on the activity of ABCB transporters (Peer et al., 2011). A key function of certain apyrases is to help maintain a low steady state of extracellular ATP (eATP) (Knowles, 2011; Lim et al., 2014), which is a known regulator of diverse responses in plants and animals (Clark et al., 2014). The blocking of apyrase expression or activity increases [eATP] (Lim et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2007), and increasing [eATP] promotes the retention of herbicides (Windsor et al., 2003) and suppresses polar auxin transport (Tang et al., 2003), implying that increased [eATP], similar to the blocking of apyrase activity, inhibits the activity of ABC transporters. Taken together, these results support a dual role for apyrases and ABC transporters in herbicide resistance and auxin transport, and indicate that disruption of apyrase activity can inhibit ABC transport activity and thus block the continued efflux of toxic compounds. The ability of apyrase inhibitors to suppress the export of herbicides from plant cells by inhibiting ABCB transport activity raises the possibility that they could suppress the export of fungicides from pathogenic fungi and thus enhance the potency of fungicides. To the extent that apyrase inhibitors are as effective against fungal ABC transporters as they are against plant ABCB transporters, they could enhance the fungicidal potency of fungicides, just as they enhance the herbicidal potency of herbicides. Apyrases have been well studied in animal and plant cells (Clark et al., 2014; Knowles, 2011), but have been less well characterized in plant‐pathogenic fungi (Sansom, 2012; Sansom et al., 2008). In animal and plant cells, there are both surface‐localized and Golgi‐localized apyrases (Knowles, 2011). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are only two apyrases, and both are Golgi localized, where they have been demonstrated to play roles in glycosylation processes in the Golgi lumen (Abeijon et al., 1993; Gao et al., 1999). In other fungal species, there also appear to be Golgi‐localized apyrases, based on experimental evidence, as well as on sequence analyses that predict their cellular localization. Golgi‐localized apyrases have been characterized in non‐pathogenic and pathogenic fungi, where they play an important role in secretion and cell wall processes (Herrero et al., 2002; Lopez‐Esparza et al., 2013; Uccelletti et al., 2007). However, there is also some evidence for surface‐localized ecto‐apyrase activity in human fungal pathogens (Collopy‐Junior et al., 2006; Junior et al., 2005; Kiffer‐Moreira et al., 2010). In addition to apyrases, there are also fungal ectophosphatases that can hydrolyse eATP and eADP, even though their K m for these substrates is much higher than that of apyrases. Ectophosphatases have been shown to play important roles in processes of nutrition, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, virulence and infection, and so they could affect fungal resistance to fungicides in other ways (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014). Adhesion to host cells is the first step in the establishment of a fungal infection, and ectophosphatases may be one of the first proteins of pathogens that come into contact with host cells. Recent results have indicated that these ectophosphatase activities increase the potency of fungi to adhere to host cells (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014). The objective of this study was to determine whether or not four specific apyrase inhibitors (AI.1 [N‐(m‐tolyl)‐(1,1′‐biphenyl)‐4‐sulfonamide], AI.10 (S‐heptyl‐2‐oxo‐2H‐chromene‐3‐carbothioate), AI.13 {3‐[N‐(4‐bromophenyl)sulfamoyl]‐N‐(3‐nitrophenyl)benzamide} and AI.15 {(E)‐3‐methyl‐N′‐[1‐(naphthalen‐2‐yl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide}) enhance the potency of the commonly available fungicides to more effectively restrict the growth of several plant‐pathogenic fungal species.",

    "results": "Results Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of pathogenic fungal apyrases A multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the primary structure of the apyrases from different pathogenic fungi differ in the size of their C‐terminal ends from the known plant apyrases (Fig. S1a, see Supporting Information). The apyrases of Colletotrichum graminicola and Verticillium dahliae are close to each other and lie on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree, whereas those in B. cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum lie on different branches (Fig. S1b). Apyrase inhibitors differentially enhance the effects of fungicides on the growth of plant fungal pathogens The effects of apyrase inhibitors NGXT191 (in this study AI.1) (Clark et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Windsor et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007) and NGXT1913 (AI.13) (Clark et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2012) on plant growth and development have been reported previously. In addition to these two apyrase inhibitors, we used two further apyrase inhibitors (AI.10 and AI.15) in this study (Fig. 1). These four apyrase inhibitors did not affect the growth of F. oxysporum by themselves at the concentrations used in this study (Fig. S2, see Supporting Information). In addition, AI.1 and AI.13 did not affect the growth of C. graminicola and V. dahlia by themselves at the concentrations used (data not shown). However, all four of these apyrase inhibitors differentially enhanced the effect of fungicides (copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole) against the five different plant‐pathogenic fungi, as judged by the plate assays used (Wang et al., 2012) and described in detail in the following sections. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Chemical structure, systematic names and molecular formulae of the apyrase inhibitors (AIs) used in this study.Botrytis cinerea The only apyrase inhibitor that showed a statistically significant effect on the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit B. cinerea fungal growth was AI.1. When AI.1 was combined with copper octanoate, it had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea, showing 22% more growth inhibition than copper octanoate treatment alone (Fig. 2a). All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil and propiconazole on the growth of B. cinerea (Fig. 2b,c). Inhibitor AI.10 was the least effective of the four inhibitors at potentiating the growth inhibition caused by myclobutanil and propiconazole. Figure 2.

Although combining any of the four inhibitors with propiconazole resulted in a statistically significant effect on the ability of this fungicide to inhibit the growth of C. graminicola, the difference relative to propiconazole alone was not large (Fig. 3c). The most effective inhibitor at potentiating the growth inhibitory effects of each of the three fungicides on C. graminicola was AI.1. Figure 3.

In the presence of each of the inhibitors, the fungicide propiconazole had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of F. oxysporum relative to propiconazole alone (Figs 4 and 5c).

Similarly, all four apyrase inhibitors combined with myclobutanil or propiconazole resulted in a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the growth of S. sclerotiorum relative to treatment with either of these fungicides alone (Fig. 6b,c). However, the effects of the inhibitors on the ability of propiconazole to inhibit growth were less than 10% relative to propiconazole alone. Figure 6.

All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil on the growth of V. dahliae (Fig. 7b). In contrast, although all four inhibitors statistically significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of propiconazole on the growth of V. dahliae, this effect was not as significant (Fig. 7c).

Apyrase inhibitors differentially increase the retention of propiconazole in B. cinerea, C. graminicola and S. sclerotiorum In order to test a postulated mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of fungicides to inhibit fungal growth, we assayed the levels of propiconazole retained in three fungal species when only a fungicide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent was applied relative to when the fungicide was applied with one of the apyrase inhibitors in DMSO. Treatment with AI.13 + propiconazole for 12 days resulted in a significantly higher retention of propiconazole (two‐fold) in B. cinerea compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8a). Similarly, treatment with AI.1 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in a significantly higher level (two‐fold) of propiconazole retained in C. graminicola compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8b). Moreover, in S. sclerotiorum, treatment with AI.10 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in an approximately two‐fold increased retention of propiconazole compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8c).

Apyrase inhibitors suppress apyrase activity released by fungi into growth media Apyrase activity, defined as nucleoside triphosphate‐diphosphohydrolase activity that is insensitive to inhibition by molybdate and ascorbic acid, does not hydrolyse AMP substrates and has a pH optimum near neutral (Knowles, 2011), was identified in the growth media of B. cinerea and F. oxysporum, and partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, as used to partially purify pea apyrase (Chen et al., 1987). Inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 each inhibited the apyrase activity precipitated by both 50% and 80% ammonium sulfate treatments (Fig. 9). In the enzyme preparation from B. cinerea the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 65–96%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 59–65% (Fig. 9a). For F. oxysporum the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 49–50%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 33–65% (Fig. 9b). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Apyrase inhibitors suppress the apyrase activity released by fungi into the growth medium. (a) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Botrytis cinerea that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. (b) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Fusarium oxysporum that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. Pi, inorganic phosphate. Apyrase suppression results in increased [eATP] in fungal growth media When a fungal culture of F. oxysporum was treated with DMSO and 65 µm apyrase inhibitor AI.1, [eATP] increased over the control level at 24 h, and increased further up to 48 h. It then declined at 72 h. At 24, 48 and 72 h, the increased [eATP] was significantly higher than that of the DMSO control (Fig. S3, see Supporting Information). Addition of either ATP or ATPγS does not enhance the fungicidal effect The addition of 12 mm ATP and 2.14 mm myclobutanil to a fungal culture of B. cinerea yielded a growth inhibition area of 83 mm2, far less than the inhibition area observed for this pathogen in Fig. 2b using myclobutanil combinations with any one of the apyrase inhibitors tested. To test whether ATPγS, which is poorly hydrolysable, would be more effective than ATP, we assayed its ability to enhance the potency of copper octanoate. As shown in Fig. S4 (see Supporting Information), ATPγS was also ineffective in increasing fungicidal activity.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Consistent with previous reports showing that apyrase inhibitors can enhance the potency of herbicides (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003), our data show that apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of different fungicides when compared with fungicide treatment alone (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). At the concentrations used, the apyrase inhibitors tested here did not affect the growth of fungi by themselves (Fig. S2), just as, by themselves, they do not inhibit the growth of plants at concentrations that increase herbicide effectiveness. In contrast, pretreatment of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, with anti‐psychotic drugs that can inhibit ecto‐NTPDases (ecto‐apyrases) does suppress the effectiveness of this fungus in infecting rice (Long et al., 2015). To address the question of whether the addition of inhibitors affects efflux mechanisms, our mass spectroscopy study showed that fungi grown with fungicides together with inhibitors retain more than two‐fold more fungicide inside their hyphae than fungi grown only with fungicides (Fig. 8), just as plants grown with herbicide–inhibitor mixtures retain more herbicide than those treated with herbicide alone (Windsor et al., 2003). Taken together these observations indicate that apyrase inhibitors function similarly in fungi as they do in higher plants, and that apyrase activity and efflux transport activity are linked in fungi as they are in plants. A plausible interpretation of the fungicide retention data (Fig. 8) is that the apyrase inhibitors can reduce the activity of ATP‐driven efflux transportation of fungicides out of the hyphae of several pathogenic fungi. Because a number of different efflux transporters are probably involved in fungicide efflux in the different pathogenic fungi tested, the results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the apyrase inhibitors are active against a broad range of transporters. Alternatively, the mass spectroscopy data could be interpreted to mean that the inhibitors shift the equilibrium between uptake and efflux of the fungicide more towards uptake in these fungi, although there are no previous data to indicate that the inhibitors affect uptake mechanisms. Apyrases have unique phosphatase activity and are the most potent phosphatases (have the lowest K m) for the hydrolysis of tri‐ and dinucleotides. The apyrase inhibitors used in these studies were selected in a screen which demonstrated that they were more effective against apyrases than against alkaline or acid phosphatases or luciferases (Windsor et al., 2002). One possible mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the effectiveness of fungicides is similar to the manner in which they have been postulated to increase herbicidal action in plants, which is by disruption of the ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane, resulting in a reduction in the ATP‐driven efflux activity of ABC transporters (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003). In both plant and animal cells, ABC transporters can release ATP into the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Abraham et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011); thus, it is possible that certain fungal ABC transporters could also efflux ATP when transporting toxins from the cell. The inhibition of apyrase activity would then be expected to increase eATP levels, and, as a result, the inside–outside ATP concentration gradient would decrease, and, according to models first published in animal systems (Abraham et al., 1993), the fungal cells would become less able to export fungicides, leading to the inhibition of growth. Although we observed that treatment with apyrase inhibitors increased [eATP] in the media in which fungi were growing (Fig. S3), simply adding ATP or ATPγS to the media with fungicides did not increase the potency of the fungicides (Fig. S4). This result is in contrast with that observed by Windsor et al. (2003) in plants, where an increase in [ATP] in the applied herbicides increased their herbicidal activity. The greater effectiveness of apyrase inhibitors over the applied ATP or ATPγS in enhancing the potency of fungicides may be related to the hydrophobic character of fungal cell walls. As noted above, according to current models, the likely site of action for either apyrase inhibitors or eATP is the plasma membrane. The fungal cell wall contains lipids and waxes, and may also contain hydrophobin proteins, making it rather resistant to penetration by hydrophilic substances (Ross, 2001). Apyrase inhibitors are relatively hydrophobic and would be able to diffuse through the wall better than hydrophilic ATP or ATPγS molecules. Thus, although the inhibitors could, by blocking ecto‐apyrase activity at the plasma membrane, increase [eATP] at that site, externally applied ATP or ATPγS might be repelled at the wall surface and thus not alter significantly the gradient of ATP across the plasma membrane. An alternative mechanism for inhibitor enhancement of fungicidal activity could be that the inhibitors may function to disrupt apyrase activity in the Golgi, the main subcellular site of apyrase function in yeast (Abeijon et al., 1993). The inhibitors are sufficiently hydrophobic to enter cells and interact with Golgi‐localized apyrases. Based on the known functions of apyrases in yeast, this action would be expected to block both the glycosylation of many membrane proteins, including efflux transporters, and their insertion into the plasma membrane, and both of these effects would probably diminish efflux transporter activity in the pathogenic fungi studied. The testing of this hypothesis would require the development of immunological, cytological and biochemical tools to study the locale of both apyrases and efflux transporters in pathogenic fungi and the post‐translational modification of the transporters. Any discussion on the different potential modes of action of apyrase inhibitors should note their ability to inhibit other phosphatases that could be present in fungal walls or inside fungal cells. To the extent that they penetrate into cells, the inhibitors could suppress the activity of intracellular apyrases and phosphatases, and this, too, could contribute to their enhancement of fungicidal activity. Table S1 (see Supporting Information) summarizes previously published data on the relative effectiveness of the four inhibitors used in these studies in blocking the activity of apyrase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and luciferase. Although the relative specificity of the inhibitors varies, the one feature they have in common is that they are all more effective in inhibiting apyrase than any other phosphatase. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out inhibitor effects on intracellular and extracellular enzymes other than apyrase. The different inhibitors used have different potencies to inhibit potato apyrase (Windsor et al., 2003, 2002), and so it was important to assay whether they inhibit equally the apyrase activities found in extracts of the different pathogens. For these experiments, apyrase activity found in the growth media for B. cinerea and F. oxysporum was used. Apyrase activity can be partially purified from crude extracts of both pea (Chen et al., 1987) and Arabidopsis (data not shown) by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and may be found in pellets precipitated by both 50% and 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 both inhibited all the apyrase preparations tested, but were more potent against the B. cinerea apyrase than the F. oxysporum apyrase, a result consistent with our observation that the inhibitors enhanced fungicidal activity more strongly against B. cinerea than against F. oxysporum. To better document the differential effectiveness of different apyrase inhibitors against different apyrases from fungal pathogens, tests should be performed with fully purified apyrases from these pathogens. With regard to their field use, apyrase inhibitors mixed with fungicides would typically be applied to seeds or to mature stages of crop growth. Thus the inhibitor–fungicide mixture would rarely be used at the same time as herbicides, which are typically applied to kill weeds at the seedling stage of crop growth. The inhibitors themselves have no negative effects on plant growth (Windsor et al., 2003), and so it is unlikely that the presence of apyrase inhibitors in fungicides when they are used on plants would have any negative effects on the plants. In recent years, it has become clear that plant apyrases also play a role in biotic defence responses (Cao et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2014). The best‐studied example of plant apyrase involvement in the ability of plants to defend themselves against fungal pathogens is that of the pea ecto‐apyrase PsAPY1 (Amano et al., 2013; Shiraishi, 2013; Toyoda et al., 2012). A suppressor molecule produced by the fungal pathogen, Mycosphaerella pinodes, regulates the activity of this pea apyrase (Toyoda et al., 2012). Ectopic expression of PsAPY1 in Nicotiana increased resistance to pathogen attack (Shiraishi, 2013). Similarly, other recent findings have indicated that transient expression of a Medicago truncatula apyrase in Nicotiana benthamiana limits necrotic lesions formed in response to attack from a fungal pathogen (Toyoda et al., 2014), and an extracellular apyrase in peas plays a key role in plant defence against fungal pathogenesis before the onset of pathogen‐associated molecular pattern (PAMP)‐triggered immunity (Toyoda et al., 2016). Previous data have indicated that apyrase activity is strongly linked to efflux transporter activity in plants. The most likely interpretation of the new data presented here in fungi is that this linkage is also true in fungi. Although the molecular mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors disrupt the efflux of toxins has not yet been defined, the fact that these inhibitors promote the retention of pesticides in both plants and fungi suggests that the apyrase–efflux transporter relationship has been functionally conserved in evolution. Independent of these theoretical considerations, our findings may have practical utility for the creation of advanced formulations of more potent fungicides that will aid in the control of pathogenic fungi and help to prevent devastating crop loss. The plate assays reported here raise the question of whether apyrase inhibitors would enhance the potency of fungicides and provide pathogen protection to plants in glasshouse or field studies. Field trials have begun, and although not reported here, an initial study of wheat seeds infected by a mixture of pathogenic fungi, including species of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium and Cladosporium, revealed that apyrase inhibitor AI.1 significantly enhanced the potency of tebuconazole (a close relative of propiconazole) to prevent fungal growth on the seeds. The reduction of fungal counts on the seeds treated with a mixture of tebuconazole and AI.1 was more than 50% greater than the reduction seen with tebuconazole treatment alone. These results offer promise that the apyrase inhibitors studied here may become valuable aids in efforts to reduce the heavy losses inflicted by pathogenic fungi on major crops each year.",

In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide‐potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi. Keywords: ABC transporters, copper octanoate, myclobutanil, plant pathogens, propiconazoleIntroduction Fungal pathogens cause devastating losses of crops and postharvest fruits worldwide (Chen et al., 2008). Many chemical fungicides have been used in high doses and frequent intervals to prevent these losses by killing different fungal species. The global market for fungicides was estimated to be over $7.4 billion in 2005 (Morton and Staub, 2008) and is expected to rise to over $20 billion by 2017 (Israel, 2013). To reduce the risk of crop disease and enhance the safety of food, new effective fungicides or strategies to increase the potency of current fungicides need to be developed. One limitation to the potency of fungicides is their rapid detoxification by fungi via their sequestration or export across the plasma membrane. Fungi use diverse cellular mechanisms for the export of xenobiotics. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, together with major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters, are the most extensively studied families of transporters involved in fungal efflux mechanisms (Perlin et al., 2014). ABC and MFS multidrug transporters promote fungicide resistance in plant‐pathogenic fungi. In the grey mould Botrytis cinerea, the ABC transporter BcatrD acts synergistically with the MFS transporter Bcmfs1 to mediate sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance (Hayashi et al., 2001, 2002). In addition, in B. cinerea, an ABC transporter is important for the detoxification of the plant fungitoxin camalexin, which is secreted by Arabidopsis in response to abiotic and biotic stress (Stefanato et al., 2009). Further, an ABC transporter (BcatrB) in B. cinerea is up‐regulated by treatment with the grapevine phytoalexin resveratrol and the fungicide fenpiclonil (Schoonbeek et al., 2001). Consistent with these findings, a B. cinerea ABC transporter mutant (ΔBcatrB) shows increased sensitivity to resveratrol and fenpiclonil during its infection of grapevine, suggesting that BcatrB provides protection against the activity of plant defence compounds and fungicides in B. cinerea. Chemical agents that inhibit the activity of ABC transporters help prevent the disease caused by growth of the pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola on wheat seedlings, although these agents do not synergize the effectiveness of the fungicide cyproconazole (Roohparvar et al., 2007). More recently, another fungal ABC transporter protein has been shown to play a role in providing resistance to fungicides in Clonostchys rosea (Dubey et al., 2014). Any inhibition of the fungal toxin efflux mechanism would increase the potency of fungicides. For example, in the citrus green mould Penicillium digitatum, disruption of the ABC transporter gene PMRI causes a loss of DMI resistance. The effect of blocking transporter activity on fungal resistance to fungicides was also explored by Reimann and Deising (2005). They used confocal fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide stains to indirectly evaluate the resistance of fungi to the fungicide azoxystrobin after the application of a transport inhibitor. They first documented that plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence in stained Pyrenophora tritici‐repentis results from energy‐dependent efflux transporter activity. Then, they found that the addition of the NG5‐13a transporter inhibitor eliminated plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence. The addition of this compound to fungicides allowed chemical control of fungicide‐resistant isolates of the wheat fungal pathogen. These results provide indirect evidence that efflux transporters contribute to fungicide resistance in P. tritici‐repentis. Other authors have also noted that ABC transporters play a key role in aiding the resistance of pathogenic fungi to fungicides by exporting fungicides (e.g. Coleman and Mylonakis, 2009; Kretschmer et al., 2009; Perlin et al., 2014; Sang et al., 2015). Plants also detoxify xenobiotics by exporting them, and a previous report has documented that overexpression of either an ABCB1 homologue (AtPgp1) or an apyrase (NTPDase) enzyme (AtAPY1) confers multiherbicide resistance to Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Windsor et al., 2003). Furthermore, inhibitors of apyrase enzyme activity suppress the ability of plants to export herbicides and thus increase their sensitivity to these toxins (Windsor et al., 2003). Consistent with these findings are the results of Liu et al. (2012), who showed that genetic suppression of apyrase expression decreased the transport of the growth hormone auxin, a process known to be dependent on the activity of ABCB transporters (Peer et al., 2011). A key function of certain apyrases is to help maintain a low steady state of extracellular ATP (eATP) (Knowles, 2011; Lim et al., 2014), which is a known regulator of diverse responses in plants and animals (Clark et al., 2014). The blocking of apyrase expression or activity increases [eATP] (Lim et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2007), and increasing [eATP] promotes the retention of herbicides (Windsor et al., 2003) and suppresses polar auxin transport (Tang et al., 2003), implying that increased [eATP], similar to the blocking of apyrase activity, inhibits the activity of ABC transporters. Taken together, these results support a dual role for apyrases and ABC transporters in herbicide resistance and auxin transport, and indicate that disruption of apyrase activity can inhibit ABC transport activity and thus block the continued efflux of toxic compounds. The ability of apyrase inhibitors to suppress the export of herbicides from plant cells by inhibiting ABCB transport activity raises the possibility that they could suppress the export of fungicides from pathogenic fungi and thus enhance the potency of fungicides. To the extent that apyrase inhibitors are as effective against fungal ABC transporters as they are against plant ABCB transporters, they could enhance the fungicidal potency of fungicides, just as they enhance the herbicidal potency of herbicides. Apyrases have been well studied in animal and plant cells (Clark et al., 2014; Knowles, 2011), but have been less well characterized in plant‐pathogenic fungi (Sansom, 2012; Sansom et al., 2008). In animal and plant cells, there are both surface‐localized and Golgi‐localized apyrases (Knowles, 2011). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are only two apyrases, and both are Golgi localized, where they have been demonstrated to play roles in glycosylation processes in the Golgi lumen (Abeijon et al., 1993; Gao et al., 1999). In other fungal species, there also appear to be Golgi‐localized apyrases, based on experimental evidence, as well as on sequence analyses that predict their cellular localization. Golgi‐localized apyrases have been characterized in non‐pathogenic and pathogenic fungi, where they play an important role in secretion and cell wall processes (Herrero et al., 2002; Lopez‐Esparza et al., 2013; Uccelletti et al., 2007). However, there is also some evidence for surface‐localized ecto‐apyrase activity in human fungal pathogens (Collopy‐Junior et al., 2006; Junior et al., 2005; Kiffer‐Moreira et al., 2010). In addition to apyrases, there are also fungal ectophosphatases that can hydrolyse eATP and eADP, even though their K m for these substrates is much higher than that of apyrases. Ectophosphatases have been shown to play important roles in processes of nutrition, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, virulence and infection, and so they could affect fungal resistance to fungicides in other ways (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014). Adhesion to host cells is the first step in the establishment of a fungal infection, and ectophosphatases may be one of the first proteins of pathogens that come into contact with host cells. Recent results have indicated that these ectophosphatase activities increase the potency of fungi to adhere to host cells (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014). The objective of this study was to determine whether or not four specific apyrase inhibitors (AI.1 [N‐(m‐tolyl)‐(1,1′‐biphenyl)‐4‐sulfonamide], AI.10 (S‐heptyl‐2‐oxo‐2H‐chromene‐3‐carbothioate), AI.13 {3‐[N‐(4‐bromophenyl)sulfamoyl]‐N‐(3‐nitrophenyl)benzamide} and AI.15 {(E)‐3‐methyl‐N′‐[1‐(naphthalen‐2‐yl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide}) enhance the potency of the commonly available fungicides to more effectively restrict the growth of several plant‐pathogenic fungal species.Results Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of pathogenic fungal apyrases A multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the primary structure of the apyrases from different pathogenic fungi differ in the size of their C‐terminal ends from the known plant apyrases (Fig. S1a, see Supporting Information). The apyrases of Colletotrichum graminicola and Verticillium dahliae are close to each other and lie on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree, whereas those in B. cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum lie on different branches (Fig. S1b).Apyrase inhibitors differentially enhance the effects of fungicides on the growth of plant fungal pathogens The effects of apyrase inhibitors NGXT191 (in this study AI.1) (Clark et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Windsor et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007) and NGXT1913 (AI.13) (Clark et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2012) on plant growth and development have been reported previously. In addition to these two apyrase inhibitors, we used two further apyrase inhibitors (AI.10 and AI.15) in this study (Fig. 1). These four apyrase inhibitors did not affect the growth of F. oxysporum by themselves at the concentrations used in this study (Fig. S2, see Supporting Information). In addition, AI.1 and AI.13 did not affect the growth of C. graminicola and V. dahlia by themselves at the concentrations used (data not shown). However, all four of these apyrase inhibitors differentially enhanced the effect of fungicides (copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole) against the five different plant‐pathogenic fungi, as judged by the plate assays used (Wang et al., 2012) and described in detail in the following sections. Figure 1.

When AI.1 was combined with copper octanoate, it had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea, showing 22% more growth inhibition than copper octanoate treatment alone (Fig. 2a). All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil and propiconazole on the growth of B. cinerea (Fig. 2b,c). Inhibitor AI.10 was the least effective of the four inhibitors at potentiating the growth inhibition caused by myclobutanil and propiconazole. Figure 2.

Although combining any of the four inhibitors with propiconazole resulted in a statistically significant effect on the ability of this fungicide to inhibit the growth of C. graminicola, the difference relative to propiconazole alone was not large (Fig. 3c). The most effective inhibitor at potentiating the growth inhibitory effects of each of the three fungicides on C. graminicola was AI.1. Figure 3.

In the presence of each of the inhibitors, the fungicide propiconazole had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of F. oxysporum relative to propiconazole alone (Figs 4 and 5c).

Similarly, all four apyrase inhibitors combined with myclobutanil or propiconazole resulted in a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the growth of S. sclerotiorum relative to treatment with either of these fungicides alone (Fig. 6b,c). However, the effects of the inhibitors on the ability of propiconazole to inhibit growth were less than 10% relative to propiconazole alone. Figure 6.

All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil on the growth of V. dahliae (Fig. 7b). In contrast, although all four inhibitors statistically significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of propiconazole on the growth of V. dahliae, this effect was not as significant (Fig. 7c).

Treatment with AI.13 + propiconazole for 12 days resulted in a significantly higher retention of propiconazole (two‐fold) in B. cinerea compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8a). Similarly, treatment with AI.1 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in a significantly higher level (two‐fold) of propiconazole retained in C. graminicola compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8b). Moreover, in S. sclerotiorum, treatment with AI.10 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in an approximately two‐fold increased retention of propiconazole compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8c).

Inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 each inhibited the apyrase activity precipitated by both 50% and 80% ammonium sulfate treatments (Fig. 9). In the enzyme preparation from B. cinerea the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 65–96%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 59–65% (Fig. 9a). For F. oxysporum the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 49–50%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 33–65% (Fig. 9b). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Apyrase inhibitors suppress the apyrase activity released by fungi into the growth medium. (a) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Botrytis cinerea that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. (b) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Fusarium oxysporum that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. Pi, inorganic phosphate.Apyrase suppression results in increased [eATP] in fungal growth media When a fungal culture of F. oxysporum was treated with DMSO and 65 µm apyrase inhibitor AI.1, [eATP] increased over the control level at 24 h, and increased further up to 48 h. It then declined at 72 h. At 24, 48 and 72 h, the increased [eATP] was significantly higher than that of the DMSO control (Fig. S3, see Supporting Information).Addition of either ATP or ATPγS does not enhance the fungicidal effect The addition of 12 mm ATP and 2.14 mm myclobutanil to a fungal culture of B. cinerea yielded a growth inhibition area of 83 mm2, far less than the inhibition area observed for this pathogen in Fig. 2b using myclobutanil combinations with any one of the apyrase inhibitors tested. To test whether ATPγS, which is poorly hydrolysable, would be more effective than ATP, we assayed its ability to enhance the potency of copper octanoate. As shown in Fig. S4 (see Supporting Information), ATPγS was also ineffective in increasing fungicidal activity.Discussion Consistent with previous reports showing that apyrase inhibitors can enhance the potency of herbicides (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003), our data show that apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of different fungicides when compared with fungicide treatment alone (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). At the concentrations used, the apyrase inhibitors tested here did not affect the growth of fungi by themselves (Fig. S2), just as, by themselves, they do not inhibit the growth of plants at concentrations that increase herbicide effectiveness. In contrast, pretreatment of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, with anti‐psychotic drugs that can inhibit ecto‐NTPDases (ecto‐apyrases) does suppress the effectiveness of this fungus in infecting rice (Long et al., 2015). To address the question of whether the addition of inhibitors affects efflux mechanisms, our mass spectroscopy study showed that fungi grown with fungicides together with inhibitors retain more than two‐fold more fungicide inside their hyphae than fungi grown only with fungicides (Fig. 8), just as plants grown with herbicide–inhibitor mixtures retain more herbicide than those treated with herbicide alone (Windsor et al., 2003). Taken together these observations indicate that apyrase inhibitors function similarly in fungi as they do in higher plants, and that apyrase activity and efflux transport activity are linked in fungi as they are in plants. A plausible interpretation of the fungicide retention data (Fig. 8) is that the apyrase inhibitors can reduce the activity of ATP‐driven efflux transportation of fungicides out of the hyphae of several pathogenic fungi. Because a number of different efflux transporters are probably involved in fungicide efflux in the different pathogenic fungi tested, the results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the apyrase inhibitors are active against a broad range of transporters. Alternatively, the mass spectroscopy data could be interpreted to mean that the inhibitors shift the equilibrium between uptake and efflux of the fungicide more towards uptake in these fungi, although there are no previous data to indicate that the inhibitors affect uptake mechanisms. Apyrases have unique phosphatase activity and are the most potent phosphatases (have the lowest K m) for the hydrolysis of tri‐ and dinucleotides. The apyrase inhibitors used in these studies were selected in a screen which demonstrated that they were more effective against apyrases than against alkaline or acid phosphatases or luciferases (Windsor et al., 2002). One possible mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the effectiveness of fungicides is similar to the manner in which they have been postulated to increase herbicidal action in plants, which is by disruption of the ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane, resulting in a reduction in the ATP‐driven efflux activity of ABC transporters (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003). In both plant and animal cells, ABC transporters can release ATP into the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Abraham et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011); thus, it is possible that certain fungal ABC transporters could also efflux ATP when transporting toxins from the cell. The inhibition of apyrase activity would then be expected to increase eATP levels, and, as a result, the inside–outside ATP concentration gradient would decrease, and, according to models first published in animal systems (Abraham et al., 1993), the fungal cells would become less able to export fungicides, leading to the inhibition of growth. Although we observed that treatment with apyrase inhibitors increased [eATP] in the media in which fungi were growing (Fig. S3), simply adding ATP or ATPγS to the media with fungicides did not increase the potency of the fungicides (Fig. S4). This result is in contrast with that observed by Windsor et al. (2003) in plants, where an increase in [ATP] in the applied herbicides increased their herbicidal activity. The greater effectiveness of apyrase inhibitors over the applied ATP or ATPγS in enhancing the potency of fungicides may be related to the hydrophobic character of fungal cell walls. As noted above, according to current models, the likely site of action for either apyrase inhibitors or eATP is the plasma membrane. The fungal cell wall contains lipids and waxes, and may also contain hydrophobin proteins, making it rather resistant to penetration by hydrophilic substances (Ross, 2001). Apyrase inhibitors are relatively hydrophobic and would be able to diffuse through the wall better than hydrophilic ATP or ATPγS molecules. Thus, although the inhibitors could, by blocking ecto‐apyrase activity at the plasma membrane, increase [eATP] at that site, externally applied ATP or ATPγS might be repelled at the wall surface and thus not alter significantly the gradient of ATP across the plasma membrane. An alternative mechanism for inhibitor enhancement of fungicidal activity could be that the inhibitors may function to disrupt apyrase activity in the Golgi, the main subcellular site of apyrase function in yeast (Abeijon et al., 1993). The inhibitors are sufficiently hydrophobic to enter cells and interact with Golgi‐localized apyrases. Based on the known functions of apyrases in yeast, this action would be expected to block both the glycosylation of many membrane proteins, including efflux transporters, and their insertion into the plasma membrane, and both of these effects would probably diminish efflux transporter activity in the pathogenic fungi studied. The testing of this hypothesis would require the development of immunological, cytological and biochemical tools to study the locale of both apyrases and efflux transporters in pathogenic fungi and the post‐translational modification of the transporters. Any discussion on the different potential modes of action of apyrase inhibitors should note their ability to inhibit other phosphatases that could be present in fungal walls or inside fungal cells. To the extent that they penetrate into cells, the inhibitors could suppress the activity of intracellular apyrases and phosphatases, and this, too, could contribute to their enhancement of fungicidal activity. Table S1 (see Supporting Information) summarizes previously published data on the relative effectiveness of the four inhibitors used in these studies in blocking the activity of apyrase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and luciferase. Although the relative specificity of the inhibitors varies, the one feature they have in common is that they are all more effective in inhibiting apyrase than any other phosphatase. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out inhibitor effects on intracellular and extracellular enzymes other than apyrase. The different inhibitors used have different potencies to inhibit potato apyrase (Windsor et al., 2003, 2002), and so it was important to assay whether they inhibit equally the apyrase activities found in extracts of the different pathogens. For these experiments, apyrase activity found in the growth media for B. cinerea and F. oxysporum was used. Apyrase activity can be partially purified from crude extracts of both pea (Chen et al., 1987) and Arabidopsis (data not shown) by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and may be found in pellets precipitated by both 50% and 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 both inhibited all the apyrase preparations tested, but were more potent against the B. cinerea apyrase than the F. oxysporum apyrase, a result consistent with our observation that the inhibitors enhanced fungicidal activity more strongly against B. cinerea than against F. oxysporum. To better document the differential effectiveness of different apyrase inhibitors against different apyrases from fungal pathogens, tests should be performed with fully purified apyrases from these pathogens. With regard to their field use, apyrase inhibitors mixed with fungicides would typically be applied to seeds or to mature stages of crop growth. Thus the inhibitor–fungicide mixture would rarely be used at the same time as herbicides, which are typically applied to kill weeds at the seedling stage of crop growth. The inhibitors themselves have no negative effects on plant growth (Windsor et al., 2003), and so it is unlikely that the presence of apyrase inhibitors in fungicides when they are used on plants would have any negative effects on the plants. In recent years, it has become clear that plant apyrases also play a role in biotic defence responses (Cao et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2014). The best‐studied example of plant apyrase involvement in the ability of plants to defend themselves against fungal pathogens is that of the pea ecto‐apyrase PsAPY1 (Amano et al., 2013; Shiraishi, 2013; Toyoda et al., 2012). A suppressor molecule produced by the fungal pathogen, Mycosphaerella pinodes, regulates the activity of this pea apyrase (Toyoda et al., 2012). Ectopic expression of PsAPY1 in Nicotiana increased resistance to pathogen attack (Shiraishi, 2013). Similarly, other recent findings have indicated that transient expression of a Medicago truncatula apyrase in Nicotiana benthamiana limits necrotic lesions formed in response to attack from a fungal pathogen (Toyoda et al., 2014), and an extracellular apyrase in peas plays a key role in plant defence against fungal pathogenesis before the onset of pathogen‐associated molecular pattern (PAMP)‐triggered immunity (Toyoda et al., 2016). Previous data have indicated that apyrase activity is strongly linked to efflux transporter activity in plants. The most likely interpretation of the new data presented here in fungi is that this linkage is also true in fungi. Although the molecular mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors disrupt the efflux of toxins has not yet been defined, the fact that these inhibitors promote the retention of pesticides in both plants and fungi suggests that the apyrase–efflux transporter relationship has been functionally conserved in evolution. Independent of these theoretical considerations, our findings may have practical utility for the creation of advanced formulations of more potent fungicides that will aid in the control of pathogenic fungi and help to prevent devastating crop loss. The plate assays reported here raise the question of whether apyrase inhibitors would enhance the potency of fungicides and provide pathogen protection to plants in glasshouse or field studies. Field trials have begun, and although not reported here, an initial study of wheat seeds infected by a mixture of pathogenic fungi, including species of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium and Cladosporium, revealed that apyrase inhibitor AI.1 significantly enhanced the potency of tebuconazole (a close relative of propiconazole) to prevent fungal growth on the seeds. The reduction of fungal counts on the seeds treated with a mixture of tebuconazole and AI.1 was more than 50% greater than the reduction seen with tebuconazole treatment alone. These results offer promise that the apyrase inhibitors studied here may become valuable aids in efforts to reduce the heavy losses inflicted by pathogenic fungi on major crops each year.Experimental Procedures Fungal strain and growth media The plant‐pathogenic fungal strains B. cinerea, C. graminicola, F. oxysporum, S. sclerotiorum and V. dahliae were obtained from the Institute for Plant Genomics & Biotechnology, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX, USA. Potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was routinely used for the growth of different pathogenic fungal strains.Apyrase inhibitors and fungicides Apyrase inhibitors NGXT191 (AI.1), AI.10, NGXT1913 (AI.13) and AI.15 were used in this study. The fungicides copper octanoate (C16H30CuO4), myclobutanil (C15H17ClN4) and propiconazole (C15H17Cl2N3O2) were used. The concentrations of these compounds were as follows: copper octanoate, 285 mm; myclobutanil, 2.14 mm; propiconazole, 4.64 mm.Fungal growth test Standard antifungal susceptibility disc tests were performed to determine any potentiating effect of apyrase inhibitors on the growth of the pathogenic fungi. Wild‐type strains of the pathogenic fungi were plated on PGA medium (pH 5.6) with Whatman paper discs containing fungicides at the centre of the plate. Plates containing either apyrase inhibitors (65 μm) or an equal concentration of DMSO solvent (0.05%) served as experimental controls, and when either was applied alone, it did not affect the growth of pathogenic fungi. Plates were incubated at 30 ºC for 7 days (C. graminicola and S. sclerotiorum) or 12 days (B. cinerea, F. oxysporum and V. dahliae), depending on the growth rate of the fungi. Plates were photographed, and the zone of fungal growth inhibition was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). All the tests were performed with five replicates. The experiments were performed twice. Results were analysed for statistical significance using Student's t‐tests.Mass spectrometry sample preparation and protein estimation After fungicide treatment, both the DMSO control and the apyrase inhibitor‐grown tissue were collected and washed twice with 1 mL of potato dextrose liquid medium (pH 5.6) at 3000 g for 5 min. The tissue was frozen with liquid N2 and homogenized with a homogenizer with 0.3 mL of 85% methanol. It was then centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min at 4 ºC. The supernatant was collected and protein was quantified using a Direct Detect® Spectrometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).Fungicide quantification by mass spectrometry For mass spectrometry quantification, the D5 propiconazole (C15H12Cl2N3O2D5) standard was obtained from Analytical Standard Solutions (A2S), Saint Jean d'Illac, France as a 10‐ppm solution in acetonitrile (C2H3N). An 8‐µL aliquot of each sample was injected with 0.3 µL of the 10‐ppm standard. For propiconazole analysis, solvent B was acetonitrile and solvent A was water. The liquid chromatography (LC) program was a linear gradient from 5% B to 95% B over 4 min, followed by a 4‐min hold at 95% B. The ionization source was an Agilent Jet Stream (Santa Clara, CA, USA) source in positive mode Electrospray ionization (ESI) with a drying gas temperature of 350 ºC, drying gas flow of 13 L/min, sheath gas temperature of 350 ºC, nebulizer pressure of 40 psi, V cap of 2900 V, nozzle voltage of 1500 V, fragmenter voltage of 150 V and skimmer voltage of 65 V. The column was a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm) with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 narrow‐bore guard column (12.5 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm). Each sample was run in triplicate. The target (C15H17Cl2N3O2) and D5 standard (C15H12Cl2N3O2D5) eluted at 4.3 min and were observed as [M + H]+ and [M – Cl]+ ions. The areas of the extracted ion chromatograms for propiconazole ([C15H17Cl2N3O2 + H]+ at 342 and [C15H17Cl2N3O2 – Cl]+ at 306) and the D5 standard ([C15H12D5Cl2N3O2 + H]+ at 347 and [C15H12D5Cl2N3O2 – Cl]+ at 311) were found, and the ratio of the areas was determined. The area value was divided by the protein value to calculate the final amount of propiconazole inside the propiconazole‐ and propiconazole + apyrase inhibitor‐treated fungus.Assay of [eATP] in fungal growth media The plant‐pathogenic fungus F. oxysporum was inoculated on 5 mL of potato dextrose broth (pH 5.6) containing apyrase inhibitor AI.1 (65 µm). DMSO (0.05%) served as an experimental control. The liquid culture was kept at 30 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm for the indicated number of days. Two hours before media collection, the tubes were removed from the shaker and kept still. Three individual samples of 50 µL of medium were removed from each tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until ATP measurements were made. The [ATP] in the growth media was determined using the ENLITEN ATP Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) according to the method of Lim et al. (2014). In all cases, three biological replicates and three technical replicates were included in the average.Assay of phosphatase activity in fungal growth media and its inhibition by AI.1 and AI.13 Fusarium oxysporum and B. cinerea were grown in potato dextrose medium for 48 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to pellet down the fungal hyphae. Clear supernatant was taken to assay the phosphatase activity in the fungal growth media. Soluble fungal proteins were precipitated at 4 ºC by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 until the entire solid was dissolved in the solution up to 50% saturation. After 15 min of stirring, proteins were centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min to pellet down the precipitate. Additional (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant up to 80% saturation, and the solution was centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min to pellet down the precipitate. After the (NH4)2SO4 precipitations, proteins from the 50% and 80% (NH4)2SO4 precipitations were separately desalted, quantified and assayed for phosphatase activity with 60 mm Hepes [4‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐1‐piperazineethanesulfonic acid)], 3 mm MgCl2 and a selection of one of the following conditions: 3 mm ATP, ADP or AMP nucleotide at pH 4, pH 5.6, pH 7, pH 8 or pH 9.5. Only at pH 7 were 1.12 mm ascorbic acid and 0.8 mm ammonium molybdate added to inhibit acid and alkaline phosphatases. Samples were incubated at 30 ºC at 150 rpm with or without inhibitors. In this assay, two inhibitors (AI.1 and AI.13) were dissolved in 0.05% (v/v) DMSO at 65 µm concentration. Inorganic phosphate concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the phosphomolybdenum complex at 820 nm (Chen et al., 1956).Supporting information Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's website: Fig. S1 (a) Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of apyrases (nucleoside triphosphate‐diphosphohydrolases) from different plants and pathogenic fungi.

Copyright notice ID: 6130020 PMID: 30018170 ANN1 and ANN2 regulate Arabidopsis primary root growth by facilitating post-phloem transport of sugar in root tips.Abstract Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants. Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have been found in all plants and vertebrate species. Their tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is evolutionarily conserved in all species (Morgan et al., 2004, 2006; Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2012). In plants, annexins have been localized in many parts of the cell, including the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, vacuolar membranes, and the nucleus. Certain annexins are also found in the extracellular matrix as secreted proteins. On the molecular level, certain plant annexins serve as components of calcium channels or regulate calcium channel activity to help initiate and amplify calcium signals in plants (Laohavisit et al., 2010; Laohavisit and Davies, 2011; Davies, 2014). On the cellular level, one of the earliest functions discovered for annexins in plant cells was meditation of vesicle trafficking and secretion (Konopka-Postupolska and Clark, 2017). On the whole-plant level, key discoveries of annexin function have been carried out using mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), where there are eight different annexins that show differential expression patterns (Cantero et al., 2006). Several of these mutant studies show that certain Arabidopsis annexins function to provide stress tolerance in response to a variety of stress conditions (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009; Dalal et al., 2014; Richards et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2017). For example, overexpression of ANN1 in Arabidopsis results in increased antioxidant activity and confers drought tolerance (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009). Plant annexins are expressed in all stages of plant growth and development. Recently, Thieme et al. (2015) found that some Arabidopsis annexin transcripts can be transported across the whole plant by phloem sap. Annexin proteins have also been identified in the phloem sap of several different plant species (Kehr, 2006), and in Arabidopsis, ANN1 was found in phloem exudate of rosette leaves (Guelette et al., 2012). Immunolocalization of a pea annexin protein in young developing sieve elements led to the suggestion that annexins may play a role in phloem cell development (Clark et al., 1992). In situ transcript localization studies found that ANN1 is expressed in phloem and phloem parenchyma in Arabidopsis seedlings (Clark et al., 2001). However, the physiological importance of annexins in phloem remains undefined. Phloem transport links sources to sinks and is a key passageway for communication between leaves and roots. Sugars generated from photosynthetic leaves (source organs) and transported through the phloem to roots (sink organs) serve both as metabolic substrates to fuel plant growth and development and as signals that integrate plant responses to environmental stimuli, hormones, and changes in nutrition status (Martin et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2003; Smeekens et al., 2010; Lastdrager et al., 2014; Ljung et al., 2015; Dobrenel et al., 2016; Dodds and Lagudah, 2016; Kühn, 2016; Li and Sheen, 2016; Baena-González and Hanson, 2017). Plants have developed complex sugar-sensing systems to monitor and respond to continuous fluctuations in sugar status caused by the circadian clock and frequent environmental changes (Stitt and Zeeman, 2012). Multiple recent studies have revealed significant roles of sugar in plant growth (Lastdrager et al., 2014) and development (Wingler, 2018). For example, sugar availability to axillary buds is a key determinant for shoot branching. Removal of pea shoot tips induces a sufficient flow of sugar into axillary buds to repress the expression of the branching inhibitor gene Branched1, which highlights the importance of sugars in mediating apical dominance (Mason et al., 2014). Sugars in photosynthetic leaves function as mobile signals to repress the expression of microRNA156 and thus promote the maturation of juvenile plants (Yu et al., 2013). Important sugar responses are also found in roots, whose growth depends on Suc transported from photosynthetic leaves. This dependence underscores the importance of understanding the effects of sugars on root growth and development. Although sugar controls primary and lateral root growth in a dose-dependent manner (Freixes et al., 2002), sugar demand in roots continuously changes due to environmental signals (Lemoine et al., 2013) and developmental stages. Having a sugar-sensing system in roots that can efficiently monitor sugar levels would be important for root and whole-plant growth. However, studies of sugar signaling in roots are generally scant. Root growth is closely associated with sugar concentrations (Thompson et al., 2017). Greater soluble sugar content has been found in fast-growing roots of pruned barley plants, whereas slow-growing barley roots contain less soluble sugar (Farrar and Jones, 1986). Suc generated by photosynthesis in cotyledons is required to regulate primary root growth (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012). Suc promotes primary root elongation in a dose-dependent manner. The higher the exogenous Suc concentration, the faster primary roots elongate (Freixes et al., 2002). Furthermore, the finding that neighboring secondary roots in the same root system have different growth rates in their elongation zone as a function of local sugar concentration also favors the conclusion that sugar is a major determinant of root growth (Freixes et al., 2002). Because local sugar concentrations play critical roles in regulating root growth, it is important to learn more about the mechanisms that control sugar transport into the growing zones of the root. Sugars generated by photosynthesis in leaves are loaded into sieve elements of the phloem and then delivered by phloem into roots (De Schepper et al., 2013). According to pressure flow theory, it is the osmotic differential in phloem sieve elements that drives the bulk flow from source photosynthetic organs to sink organs such as roots. After sugar reaches its destination, it must be unloaded from phloem sieve elements into surrounding cells. Ross-Elliott et al. (2017) have proposed that after sugar reaches the connecting tissue between conducting phloem and sink tissues, called protophloem, it is unloaded into surrounding cells through funnel plasmodesmata and then diffuses freely along a concentration gradient into cells of the root tip in a symplastic way. The unloading of sugar into the elongation zone, mitotic zone, and root cap accommodates the high-energy demands of fast-growing regions in roots. Here, we describe the effect of knocking out two of the eight members of the annexin gene family in Arabidopsis, namely ANN1 and ANN2, on the diffusion of sugars from the unloading zone to root tips, and we discuss how these two annexins play an important mechanistic role in post-phloem transport of sugars into root tips. RESULTS Inhibition of Primary Root Growth in ANN1 and ANN2 Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc Independent of Its Osmotic Effects In 3-d-old seedlings, all ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants (ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1) had primary root lengths that were significantly shorter compared to wild type when grown on agar plates containing no Suc (Fig. 1, A and B). However, these knockout mutants had the same hypocotyl lengths compared to that in wild type (Supplemental Fig. S1). To rule out that the differences in primary root lengths were due to differences in germination, we also measured growth rates in both mutants and wild type under the same condition (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the root length data, the primary roots of ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 grew significantly slower compared to that in wild type. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Inhibition of primary root growth in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants is rescued by exogenous Suc independent of its osmotic effects. A, Representative images comparing primary root growth of 3-d-old Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 mutant seedlings grown on vertical Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing either no Suc, 1% mannitol, or 2% Suc. Bars, 5 mm. B, C, and D, Primary root lengths (left graphs) and growth rates (right graphs) of 3-d-old wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 seedlings grown on vertical MS plates containing either no Suc (B), 2% Suc (C), or 1% mannitol (D). Data are means ± sd (n = 16–20) of three independent experiments. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).This inhibition of primary root growth observed in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants was rescued by 2% Suc (Fig. 1, A and C). This rescue was not due to the osmotic effect of Suc in agar plates, since equimolar concentrations of mannitol did not rescue the primary root growth inhibition in ANN1 and ANN2 mutants (Fig. 1, A and D). Similar results were also found in 1% sorbitol and 1% o-methyl-Glc treatments (Supplemental Fig. S2, C and D), indicating that Suc functioned either as a carbon source or a signal to rescue the primary root growth inhibition in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants. Since Suc can be catalyzed by invertase into Fru and Glc, we also tested 1% Glc and 1% Fru treatments (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Both Glc and Fru also rescued primary root growth inhibition in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants.Inhibition of Root Cap Development in ANN1 and ANN2 Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc As observed by light microscopy, knocking out ANN1 or ANN2 affected primary root structures of 4-d-old ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 seedlings when grown without Suc. Starch detection by Lugol staining revealed reduced layers of starch-containing columella cells in ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 compared to that in the wild type (Fig. 2A). In wild type root caps, there are four layers of columella cells with Lugol-stained starch granules in them, whereas only three layers of columella cells were detected in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants. Also, unlike wild-type roots, the roots of ANN1 and ANN2 mutants had no border-like cells around their root caps. These root cap defects in ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 were rescued by 1% Suc (Fig. 2B). When grown with 1% Suc for 4 d, ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 roots showed four layers of starch-containing columella cells like those in wild type with border-like cells attached to the root caps. Figure 2. Open in a new tab ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants have root cap developmental defects when grown without Suc. A and B, Root cap features revealed by Lugol staining of granule starch in columella cells of 4-d-old Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 seedlings with or without 1% Suc. Cells with columella identity were detected by staining with Lugol solution. Ten to thirteen seedlings of each set of wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants were observed. Root tips with stained columella cells of seedlings grown without Suc (A) and with 1% Suc (B). White arrow indicates border-like cells. Bars, 10 μm.Because Lugol staining (Fig. 2A) revealed similar levels of starch granules in ann1-2, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 when seedlings were grown without Suc, ann1-2 was used as a representative line for all ann-mutants in subsequent quantification of root-tip starch levels (Fig. 3). Consistent with Lugol staining, ann1-2 displayed significantly lower levels of starch in root tips compared to that in wild type when grown without Suc (Fig. 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab ann1-mutant root tips contain less starch than wild-type root tips when grown without Suc. Quantitative analysis of starch content levels in root tips of wild-type (Col-0) and ann1-2 seedlings grown without Suc. Starch levels were measured in 2-mm root tips harvested from 10-d-old seedlings grown without Suc. Data represent means ± sd of two replicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).Expression of Photosynthesis-Related Genes and Chlorophyll Accumulation Is Enhanced in ANN1 Knockout Mutants, Dependent on the Absence of Exogenous Suc An RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis comparing the transcript abundance in total mRNA extracted from primary roots of 2-week-old wild type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 grown without Suc in light revealed many differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the primary roots of the mutants. After the DEGs were assigned to gene ontology (GO) terms, the GO analysis in ann1-2 revealed functional enrichment in photosynthesis with seven out of a total of 13 up-regulated GO categories related to photosynthesis (Supplemental Table S1). This indicated significant enhancement in the expression levels of photosynthetic genes in ann1-2 in the absence of exogenous Suc. Although Arabidopsis roots partially turn green when exposed to light, the main energy source that facilitates root growth originates in the leaves (Kobayashi et al., 2012). Thus, we decided to assay transcript levels of photosynthetic genes in the cotyledons of 4-d-old ann1-2, and wild-type seedlings grown without Suc. We assayed 4-d-old seedlings because evidence shows that the dominant roles of sugar to regulate root growth are probably restricted to the first 5 to 6 d before leaf development (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012). Among all the genes in photosynthesis-related GO categories, the top five most up-regulated ones were selected to be analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results showed that four out of five photosynthetic genes were significantly up-regulated in cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings grown without Suc (Fig. 4A). These four genes encode chlorophyll-binding protein 2 (CAB2, LHCB1.1), chlorophyll-binding protein 3 (CAB3, LHCB1.2), and two subunits of PSII light-harvesting complex (PSII, LHB1B1, and LHB1B2).

Values are means ± se (n = 15) of three independent experiments. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).We also quantified the accumulation of chlorophyll in cotyledons of 4-d-old ann1-2 and wild-type seedlings grown without Suc. Consistent with the up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression, cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings showed significantly higher intensity of chlorophyll autofluorescence signal than that in wild-type cotyledons, indicating a higher chlorophyll content in cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings compared to that in the wild type (Fig. 4, B and C). Exogenous Suc reversed the enhanced expression of photosynthetic genes and chlorophyll accumulation in cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings. When grown with 1% Suc, ann1-2 cotyledons showed similar photosynthetic gene expression levels as that in the wild type (Fig. 4D), and accumulation of chlorophyll in these tissues was also comparable (Fig. 4, E and F).Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Induces Accumulation of Soluble Sugars in Primary Roots We quantified neutral soluble sugars in primary roots of ann1-2, ann2-1 and wild type by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using primary roots collected from 1-week-old seedlings grown on agar plates containing no sugars (Supplemental Table S3). Unexpectedly, significantly higher amounts of sugars were detected in both ann1-2 and ann2-1 root tissue relative to that in wild type (Fig. 5A), including significantly higher contents of soluble Glc (Fig. 5B) and Fru (Fig. 5C). Most of the sugar detected was probably in the phloem. Figure 5. Open in a new tab ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutant roots contain significantly more soluble carbohydrates in primary roots when grown without Suc. A to C, Primary roots were harvested from 1-week-old wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown on agar plates containing no Suc. Soluble sugar contents were analyzed by GC/MS to reveal total sugar (A), Glc (B), and Fru (C) contents. Values are means ± SD of triplicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Impairs Post-Phloem Transport in Root Tips Because 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) has been widely used as a phloem-mobile probe (Oparka et al., 1994; Knoblauch et al., 2015), we used CFDA to detect post-phloem transport in wild-type, ann1-2, ann2-1, and the ANN1-overexpressing line 35S:ANN1. 35S:ANN1 seedlings showed significantly longer roots compared to that in the wild type when grown without Suc (Supplemental Fig. S3). All seedlings were grown without Suc for 4 d. After applying CFDA on cotyledons for 30 min, the dye was apparent in the two phloem files in primary roots of ann1-2, ann2-1, 35S:ANN1, and the wild type (Fig. 6A), indicating successful loading of carboxyfluorescein (CF). The wild type showed a characteristic transport pattern of CF along the root cortex (Fig. 6B). However, in ann1-2 and ann2-1, the diffusion of CF in root tips was restricted (Fig. 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutant roots have restricted diffusion of CF to root tips when grown without Suc. A, Representative images showing successful loading of CF in phloem files. White lines indicate edge of root tissue. B, Representative fluorescence micrographs of root tips from wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, ann2-1, and 35S:ANN1 (ANN1 overexpression) seedlings grown without Suc. Bar, 50 μm.

Values are means ± se (n ≥ 8). Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).The post-phloem region has been defined as the region 250 μm behind the root tip (Stadler et al., 2005; Ross-Elliott et al., 2017), so we quantified CF fluorescence in three different areas (transition zone, meristem zone, and root cap) of this post-phloem region in ann1-2, ann2-1, 35S:ANN1, and wild-type roots (Fig. 6C). Significantly lower levels of CF fluorescence were detected in both ann1-2 and ann2-1 roots compared to that in wild type when seedlings were grown without Suc. This significant decrease of CF diffusion was more obvious in root caps, reaching a level more than 50% less compared to that of wild type. In contrast to that in ann1-2 and ann2-1, 35S:ANN1 showed significantly higher levels of CF diffusion in root tips compared to that in wild type by more than 50% in root caps. Taken together, these results indicate that ann1-2 and ann2-1 roots had impaired post-phloem transport; i.e. knocking out ANN1 and ANN2 restricted the diffusion of sugars from the phloem to the root tip.Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Increased ROS Levels and Callose Accumulation in Root Tips Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate plasmodesmata permeability through callose deposition (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009, 2011; Stonebloom et al., 2012). To test whether knocking out ANN1 and ANN2 leads to ROS accumulation in root tips, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), a dye that stains hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was applied to 3-d-old seedlings grown without Suc. Significantly higher levels of stain were detected in root tips of ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to that in wild type when grown without Suc (Fig. 7, A and B). Aniline blue was used to detect callose accumulation in root tips of 3-d-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc, which revealed significantly higher levels of callose deposition in ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to that in wild type (Fig. 7, C and D).

Bar, 50 μm.DISCUSSION ANN1 and ANN2 Knockout Seedlings Show Suc-Dependent Phenotypes The observation that significantly higher contents of soluble sugar were detected by GC/MS analysis in primary roots of ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to those of wild type when grown together without Suc indicated there was successful phloem transport of sugar from shoots to roots in the knockout mutants, yet the mutants had obvious growth and columella cell defects. The fact that these defects were rescued by exogenous Suc independent of its osmotic effects suggested the possibility that ANN1 and ANN2 helped to regulate the post-phloem transport of Suc into root tips. Although successful unloading was detected in both the ANN1 knockout mutant ann1-2 and the ANN2 knockout mutant ann2-1, the diffusion of CFDA into root tips was impaired in both ann1-2 and ann2-1, indicating these mutants had restricted sugar diffusion in fast-growing regions from the unloading zone to root tips. These results are consistent with the conclusion that compromised expression of ANN1 and ANN2 leads to impaired diffusion of sugars in the fast-growing root apex, and this, in turn, inhibits primary root growth. However, further studies quantifying carbohydrate content only in the cap region after laser microdissection are required to confirm this conclusion.Sugar in Regulation of Photosynthesis The regulatory roles of sugar in photosynthetic gene transcripts and photosynthesis capacity have been widely documented (Koch, 1996; Pego et al., 2000). Sugar starvation in plants activates photosynthesis, whereas high sugar levels inhibit photosynthesis (Yu et al., 2015; Sami et al., 2016). Sugar represses the transcriptional activity of photosynthetic gene promoters transiently expressed in maize mesophyll protoplasts (Sheen, 1990). Sugar accumulation in leaves represses photosynthetic gene expression and photosynthesis (Pego et al., 2000). Roots are typical sink organs. Sugar demands in young roots promote photosynthesis in leaves. For example, overexpression of the HIGHER YIELD RICE gene encoding an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR transcription factor leads to increased root length, branching, and strength, which in turn promotes photosynthesis in leaves (Ambavaram et al., 2014). However, the mechanism of how plants monitor sugar levels in roots remains an active area of investigation. Here, we hypothesize that root tips are sugar-sensing tissues, and their sugar status can affect photosynthesis capacity in leaves. As noted above, our results revealed sugar starvation in the actively growing root apex of the ann1-2 and ann2-1 knockout mutants by using CF as a phloem mobile probe. Evidence that this apical sugar starvation led to an up-regulation of photosynthesis was indicated by the up-regulated expression of genes encoding CAB2 (LHCB1.1), CAB3 (LHCB 1.2), and PSII subunits (LHB1B1 and LHB1B2), along with increased chlorophyll contents in ann1-2. The enhancement of photosynthesis in ann1-2 was most likely the change that resulted in the elevated sugar contents observed in primary roots of ann1-2. However, because these accumulated sugars could not reach the root apex due to the defective post-phloem transport of sugars in ann1-2, they failed to rescue primary root growth defects and to reverse the enhancement of photosynthesis. Assuming that sugars accumulate in the phloem and unloading zone without sufficient diffusion into the post-phloem region, this transport defect would lead to sugar starvation in root tips. Because roots can communicate their nutrient status to shoots and induce responses in them (Ko and Helariutta, 2017), the stress of sugar starvation in root tips could initiate a root-to-shoot signal, just as salt stress in roots promote the propagation of Ca2+ waves from roots to shoots (Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). Plausibly, such a signal could help explain how sugar-deprived root tips could induce the up-regulation of photosynthetic genes in leaves. Roots efficiently take up Suc and Glc from the media (Chaudhuri et al., 2008), and consistently, exogenously supplied sugars in the medium successfully rescued primary root growth defects and reversed photosynthesis enhancement in ann1-2. These results favor the conclusion that ANN1 helps control root sugar status, which would result in feedback regulation of photosynthesis. Knocking out ANN1 may result in sugar starvation in roots, which could serve as a signal for plants to up-regulate photosynthesis.Post-Phloem Transport of Sugar to Root Tips Apical sugar concentration in root tips has been considered to play the determinant role in regulating root growth and development (Freixes et al., 2002). The diffusion of CF in root tips of ann1-2 and ann2-1 was restricted, whereas the ANN1-ovexpressing line 35S:ANN1 showed promoted diffusion of CF. We interpreted these results to indicate that knocking out ANN1 and ANN2 restricted symplastic diffusion in post-phloem transport from the unloading zone to root tips and that this restriction impaired primary root growth along with root cap development. Sugar diffuses freely along the concentration gradient through plasmodesmata in the root apex. It is now widely accepted that plasmodesmata are dynamic channels whose permeability is highly regulated during plant growth and development (Sager and Lee, 2014). Callose has been found deposited in the neck region of plasmodesmata and can restrict the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (Luna et al., 2011; Zavaliev et al., 2011). ROS accumulation can increase callose accumulation, which may result in reduced plasmodesmatal transport (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009, 2011; Stonebloom et al., 2012). ANNt1 has antioxidant activity (Gidrol et al., 1996), and this activity may help explain the results of prior studies that documented a link between ANN1 suppression and an increase in ROS levels. For example, the knockout of ANN1 results in the accumulation of higher levels of ROS in leaves compared to that in wild type (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009). Similarly, our results show that knocking out ANN1 and ANN2 leads to hyperaccumulation of ROS in root tips, and, like earlier studies, associates this change with an elevated accumulation of callose. Assuming that some of this accumulated callose is deposited in plasmodesmata, it would restrict plasmodesmatal sugar transport and thus help explain why post-phloem transport of sugar to root tips is inhibited in mutants. In conclusion, our results provide data linking ANN1 and ANN2 to the regulation of primary root growth and development. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants to include an important role in the post-phloem transport of sugars to the root tip, which, in turn, indirectly impacts photosynthetic rates in cotyledons.MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Colombia (Col-0) ecotype was used as the wild type in all experiments. ANN1 (At1g35720) and ANN2 (At5g65020) are studied. Annexin T-DNA insertion mutants including ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, ann1-2/ann2-1, and 35S:ANN1 used in this study were all obtained from Wang et al. (2015). All seeds were surface sterilized by 75% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and 20% bleach (v/v) for 10 min. After washing five times with sterile, deionized water, seeds were sowed on agar plates containing either no Suc, 2% (w/v) Suc, or 1% (w/v) mannitol. Seeds on agar plates were stratified in darkness at 4°C for 3 d. Stratified plates were placed vertically in a growth chamber (Percival AR-66 L; light intensity of 275/µmol m−2 s−1, humidity of approximately 80%, 20°C) in continuous light or in darkness. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma-Aldrich.Lugol Staining of Columella Cells Seedlings grown with 1% Suc or without Suc were submerged in a root cap fixative solution (5% [w/v] formaldehyde, 5% [v/v] acetic acid, and 25% [v/v] ethanol) for 24 h. Lugol staining of root caps was done as described by Hong et al. (2015). Ten to thirteen seedlings were imaged for each genotype with a DIC optics on a Nikon 90i Stereology microscope, using a 60× objective.Starch Quantification Starch levels in 2 mm root tips of 10-d-old wild-type and ann1-2 seedlings grown without Suc were assayed in ethanol extracts using methods described by Bergmeyer (1984), Barratt et al. (2009), and Divya et al. (2010).RNA Extraction Trizol reagent was used in all RNA extraction experiments following the manufacturer’s protocol.RNA-Seq Analysis To elucidate the mechanisms of ANN1 and ANN2 in regulation of primary root growth, we performed a comparative RNA-seq using total RNA from primary roots excised from 2-week-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc in light. Total RNA extracted from primary roots of 2-week-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc was submitted to the Genome Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF) at the University of Texas at Austin. Both library construction and sequencing were performed by GSAF. After filtering low-quality reads and removing adaptor contamination from the raw data of Illumina reads, the following steps were as described by Van Verk et al. (2013) to detect differential expression in ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to Col-0. A cutoff value of a greater than 2-fold change in expression was used to select differentially expressed genes in ann1-2 and ann2-1. To further investigate the biological functions of the DEG in both ann1-2 and ann2-1, we subsequently assigned the DEGs to GO terms. TAIR10 was downloaded for gene function descriptions and GO annotations. Ture-path rule was applied in functional enrichment analysis. A gene annotated with a particular GO term was also annotated with all its parents. To avoid very generic, noninformative terms for analysis, only terms annotating 500 or fewer genes were retained. Genes annotated with a given specific GO term were considered as a gene set. All the gene sets were tested for the statistical significance of enrichment among themselves using the cumulative hypergeometric test. Then a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was also calculated. A false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 was used for significance.RT-qPCR Analysis cDNA was transcribed from RNA by the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher) after DNase I digestion. Ten micrograms cDNA was used for each sample. RT-qPCR was performed on QuantStudio platform (Applied Biosystems) with PowerUp Sybr Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher). Transcripts of cab2 (AT1G29920), cab3 (AT1G29910), LHB1B1 (AT2G34430), LHB1B2 (AT2G34420), ANN1 (AT1G35720), and ANN2 (AT5G65020) under different conditions were studied. Primer sequences used in all RT-qPCR experiments to detect gene expression are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Specificity of gene amplifications were confirmed by melting curves. For each condition tested, three biological replicates for both wild type and ann1-2 with three technical replicates for each biological replicate were used. 2−ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) was used to calculate fold changes. For significant difference between each condition, either one-way ANOVA for three conditions or Student’s t test for two conditions was used.Detection of Chlorophyll Autofluorescence Cotyledons of 4-d-old intact ann1-2 and wild-type seedlings grown either with 1% Suc or without Suc were examined. Chlorophyll autofluorescence 660 to 701 nm was detected with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Fifteen seedlings were examined for ann1-2 and the wild type.GC/MS Analysis Wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings were grown in continuous light on agar plates containing no Suc for a week. Primary roots were collected and washed in sterile water twice. After freeze drying for 2 d, samples were submitted to complex carbohydrate research center at the University of Georgia for GC/MS analysis. Triplicate experiments were carried out.CFDA Application CFDA stock was prepared as 6 mg/mL in acetone and kept at −80°C. A dilution of 1:20 in sterile water was used for application. Wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings were grown on agar plates containing no Suc for 4 d. A cotyledon was grazed by fine tweezers to allow 1 µL CFDA to penetrate. All samples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence 500 to 566 nm was monitored.ROS Detection Three-day-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc were used. Whole seedlings were incubated in the buffer (30 mm KCl and 10 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.15) with 50 µm H2DCFDA for 1 h in darkness at room temperature. Extra dye was washed three times by the buffer before confocal microscopy. All samples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence between 517 and 527 nm was collected.Aniline Blue Staining Three-day-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc were stained by aniline blue (Biosupplies) as described by Ross-Elliott et al. (2017).Confocal Microscopy Confocal imaging was done by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zesis LSM 710) in a set manner, starting with the same image acquisition settings and data processing for all experiments. Fluorescent signals in all samples were recorded in Z stacks. Z-project in Fiji was used to flatten Z stacks either with average intensity for better quantification accuracy or with maximum intensity for better focus in representative images. Relative fold change of fluorescent intensity was calculated by division of the mean fluorescent intensity in wild type. Student’s t test was used to calculate significant difference between samples. Fluorescence was quantified in a way to avoid size difference.Accession Numbers Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank data library under accession numbers At1g35720 (ANN1), At5g65020 (ANN2), At1g29920 (cab2), At1g29910 (cab3), At2g34430 (LHB1B1), and At2g34420 (LHB2B2).Supplemental Data The following supplemental materials are available.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and isolation have negative effects on almost all systems of the human body, and understanding these effects has become a primary objective for enabling long-term space flights. Exposure to microgravity is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, but it might also have detrimental effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and cognition, since spaceflight results in significant volumetric changes in brain grey matter [1]. Furthermore, simulated microgravity in mice induced impairments in immune functions [2]. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are crucial for maintaining a healthy neural environment promoting homeostasis and responding to infection, or injury. Microglial activation can occur in response to a variety of triggers and is dependent on the type of pathological stressor or event [3]. Once activated, microglia not only primarily act as scavenger cells, removing debris and dying neurons [4], but also perform tissue repair and neural regeneration [5]. Microglia also act as second messengers by releasing a number of substances such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4,6]. Prolonged activations can lead to neuronal damage or death, as well as the activation of astrocytes, resulting in further endangerment to neurons and the further recruitment of microglia, thereby perpetuating the inflammatory state [7,8]. There are a number of potentially useful markers for specific microglia states [9]. Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) is a lysosomal protein expressed at low levels by resting microglia and at high levels by activated phagocytic microglia [7,10,11]. CD68 is commonly used to visualize activated microglia in inflammatory responses in the brain and is potentially a suitable candidate for further exploring microgravity-induced microglial activation. Studies have shown that microgravity and bedrest stimulate changes in immune cell response. Monocytes isolated from astronauts exhibit impaired function (reviewed in [12]). Furthermore, plasma concentrations of TNFα, IL-8, IL-1a, growth factors, and leukocyte recruitment chemokines have been observed to be increased in plasma following spaceflights [13]. Following the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the monocyte secretion of IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 significantly reduced, while IL-1β was elevated postflight [14]. During spaceflight, increased white blood cell count and decreased T cell function have been observed in astronaut crews [15]. Studies using blood collected from human bedrest models of head-down tilt-simulating headward fluid shifts in flight found changes in immune cells [16] and cytokine levels. After two-week hindlimb unloading (HU), a rodent model commonly used to simulate weightlessness, microgravity-induced cephalic fluid shifts, bedrest and anhedonia, the mRNA expression of numerous genes impacting immune response, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory was altered in mouse brains [17]. HU also increased microglia activations in spinal cord [18] and neural stem cells [19]. We previously observed an increase in IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17 in the hippocampus after prolonged HU [20], cytokines that are known to be produced and secreted by activated microglia [8,21], and astrocytes [22,23]. Altered gravity was also observed to downregulate ICAM-1 expression in vitro in murine BV-2 microglial cells, while a subtype of smaller cells of BV-2 microglial cells appeared and was assumed to be activated cells [24]. Overall, previous studies showed that microgravity and bedrest both induced immune response in the CNS, but the microglial activations in the hippocampus in in vivo mouse models have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that head-tilt bedrest will result in microglial activations in the hippocampus. It has been established that spaceflight and spaceflight-like stressors cause oxidative stress responses within the hippocampus [25]. Due to the incomplete mitochondrial metabolization of oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl are generated. Behavioral and cognitive changes were associated with altered measures of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and protein and DNA oxidation in the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions implicated in anxiety and spatial memory [26]. The increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to increased cytokine release from microglial cells, potentially indicating increased microglial activations [27,28]. Mitochondrial ROS is generated by activated microglia [29,30], and reducing its production is believed to be a suitable target to prevent the over-activation of microglia [27,28,31]. A mouse model for mitochondrial ROS quenching via the overexpression of the human catalase gene targeted toward the mitochondria (MCAT) has been previously utilized to investigate oxidative stress. MCAT mice have increased lifespan [32], improved age-dependent pathologies [33], reduced radiation-induced neurogenesis depletion [34], cognitive dysfunction, improved outcomes in models of neurological conditions including ataxia-telangiectasia [35], ALS [36], and Alzheimer’s disease [37]. MCAT mice also exhibit improved hippocampal spatial learning and contextual fear memory [26]. Previously, we showed that MCAT mice were protected from simulated microgravity-induced increases in cytokine expression in hippocampus. In our lab, in the MCAT mice, ROS quenching was demonstrated by measuring 4-HNE [38,39], catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation. We have also seen a strong genotype effect in the MCAT mice, with a significantly lower protein abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In a screen of forty-four cytokines and chemokines, fourteen (IFNγ, IL-4, IL-6,IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP-1, MCSF, RANTES, MCP-5, and IP-10) were downregulated in MCAT vs. WT mice [20]. These results suggest that the increased expression of these cytokines in wildtype hindlimb-unloaded mice is indictive of microglial activations and that mitochondrial ROS play an important role in microglial activation; thus, in this study, we used the MCAT mouse model to see if ROS quenching will mitigate HU-induced microglial activation. Understanding the correlations between molecular changes in the brain, behavior, and plasma markers could refine our understanding of the kinetics of neurodegenerative changes and help find early biomarkers before irreversible damage occurs. Increased cytokine expression and neuroinflammation are associated with changes in behavior. There is evidence that inflammatory factors TNFα and IL-1β are associated with increased sick behaviors [40,41,42]. Theses cytokines have also been implicated in anorexic-like behavior [43]. IFNα is known to induce depression in humans [44], and TNFα is involved in depressive-like behavior as well [45]. In a mouse model, HU resulted in anxiety-like behaviors, which were associated with significant changes in the pattern of neural oscillations in the hippocampus [46]. Oxidative stress enhanced this response, and the inhibition of ROS reduced HU-induced anxiety [47]. We previously reported significantly reduced CD4+ T cell numbers and elevation in twelve cytokines in singly, but not socially, housed mice under normal loading conditions [48]. Singly housed mice exposed to simulated microgravity downregulated only one cytokine, IL-13, which is involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and these changes were mitigated in the MCAT mouse model [20]. These data suggest that, under these conditions, social isolation and HU may reflect an epistatic interaction. In this study, we investigated the role of HU alone, without the additional isolation effect, in socially housed animals. MCAT mice were utilized to explore the association between oxidative stress and microglia activation in simulated microgravity. Correlations between microglia activation, cytokine expression and behavior were calculated to further our understanding of the effects of altered gravity on the CNS. In this study, we aim to determine the role of microglia, ROS pathways, and behavior, following head-tilt bedrest to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism behind neuroimmune changes, thus paving the way for future therapies. We hypothesize that head-tilt bedrest will affect microglia activation in the hippocampus and that, in the MCAT model, quenching ROS will mitigate these changes.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Strains In this study, a subset of the socially housed (2 per cage) sixteen-week-old female wild type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice was utilized as described in [20] and [48]. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6. Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033 Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC NAS-16-007-Y2) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). 2.2. Hindlimb Unloading to Produce Head-Down Tilt Mice were assigned to one of four experimental groups (See Supplementary Figure S1; n = 8/group unless otherwise stated) and housed in a custom caging system as previously described [48]. In accordance with our previous work and with most space rodent studies to date, we chose females for this study. Socially housed, normally loaded (NL) controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages. All HU groups were acclimated for three days in HU cages prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23–24 °C with a 12 h light: dark cycle (6 AM:6 PM lights on:off). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlets (Ancare, NY, USA) were provided for enrichment. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the start of HU via CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. 2.3. Sample Collection and Immunohistochemistry The left-brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at −20 °C to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in a mild lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%, Protease Inhibitors (Millipore-Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA) [49]. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000× g for 10 min and supernatants were aliquoted and flash frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Cytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates was analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44-Plex-MD44 (EVE Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada) in which concentration standards are run for each cytokine. To verify the Multiplex method, IL-3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat# ab113345-IL-3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 23225). Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as described for hippocampal homogenates. The results and raw data of plasma and hippocampal cytokines are shown in Rubinstein et al., 2021 [20], and used here for correlations. The right brain hemisphere was embedded in 4% PFA overnight and transferred the next day into 30% sucrose-PBS solution for cryoprotection. After sucrose impregnation, brains were embedded in OCT (OCT compound 4583, Sakura, Nagano, Japan) and frozen at −80 °C until cryosectioning. The brains were sectioned in a cryostat at 40 microns and stained for CD68. Slide-mounted sections were 1x-TBS-buffered at a pH of 7.3 and washed in H2O2 for antigen unmasking. Next, the primary antibody, rat-αmouse CD68 (Abcam ab53444, dilution 1:2000), was introduced in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum After additional TBS washes, the secondary antibody was introduced (biotinylated rabbit-αrat, dilution 1:200 (Vector BA4001) in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum). Amplification and fluorescent staining were performed with a Fluorescein Tyramide System (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA, NEL701A001KT), as described by the manufacturer. The indiscriminate nuclear staining agent 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Labs, Mowry Ave Newark, CA, USA Vectashield, H-1200-10) was used to identify hippocampal regions, and the Allen Brain Atlas was used for reference (http://mouse.brain-map.org/) We chose to analyze 4 brains from each group except NL MCAT group in which 5 brains were analyzed, all with representative sections across the entire hippocampus (CA1/2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)). We used 20X magnification, and 9–15 photos per hippocampus were taken. The unbiased microglia counting in each photo was performed manually counting microglia in each frame, using Image J program (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). 2.4. Mouse Behavioral Analysis Video surveillance: A commercially available surveillance system that allows for both day and night image captures was utilized. The Lorex 4K UHD 8-channel Fusion NVR Security System with 8 “Smart Deterrence” 4K Cameras was utilized. This cage system was designed to not disturb ongoing behavior. The camera was placed horizontally to the cage, and it is affixed to a surface at a distance enabling visibility and the capture of full ambulatory motion and all species’ typical behaviors. Video Sampling: Mice were recorded in their home cage continuously for a 24 h period, and samples of 15 min videos were analyzed using Excel to manually score the duration of various behaviors; time samples were at least 2 h away from the light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions to ensure the acquisition of stable activity levels during each phase of the diurnal cycle. We sampled 15 min from the following time points: 8 AM, 11:30 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM, 12 AM, 2 AM, and 4 AM. Each behavior graph represents the percentage of time the animal spent in engaging in a specific category from the total time measured. Videos images were manually scored in Excel and analyzed for a range of typical mouse behaviors that would indicate normal functioning. To obtain a more general behavioral profile, behaviors were pooled into the following categories: “exploratory”, “social interaction”, “active”, and “rest/sleep”: Exploratory Behavior: burrowing in bedding, climbing, exploratory sniffing, and exploratory ambulation; Social Interaction: chasing, sniffing another mouse, allogrooming, nestlet social engagement, mounting, socializing with another mouse, and pulling another mouse. Active Behavior: active behavior contains exploratory behavior, eating, drinking, sniffing, nestlet manipulation, self-grooming, ambulation, and all social interaction behaviors; Rest/Sleep: rest/Sleep behavior contains sleep and non-directed movement. 2.5. Behavioral Categories Definitions Eating: Mouth is on food. Mouse has visible food in its forepaws and is using its mouth to interact with food piece. Drinking: The animal rears up and licks the nozzle of the drinker. Borrowing: Burrowing in its bedding, which involves the paws and snout and exploring different cage parts. Chasing: Normally loaded animals only. Movement 3 or more steps towards the other mouse, while the other mouse is moving away. Inactive: Stationary in one spot with most of its body not moving. Climbing: Using paws to grip on cage in order to lift body and paws off the ground. Sniffing other mouse: One mouse’s nose in near proximity of another mouse. Alogrooming: Grooming that occurs when one mouse is grooming another mouse. Non-directed movement (during rest/sleep): Movement that is localized to a few grids (3 grids) and does not use more than three-fourths of the animal’s body. Sustained for no longer than 2 s. Exploratory ambulation: Movement that includes sniffing and meets the definition of Stanford’s four stages of exploration: search, attend, approach, and investigate while moving across multiple grids. Nestlet social engagement (described in Tahimic et al., 2019 [48]): In social HU, when one mouse extends beyond the halfway section of the shared cage and grabs a nestlet. Nestlet manipulation: Mouse directly touching nestlet with mouth and/or forepaws. Mounting: Normally loaded animals only. Mouse climbs on top of another mouse or has another mouse on top of it. Sniffing (exploratory): Moving ahead with the nose held in the air. Ambulation: Moving across multiple grids. Self-grooming: Mouse licking its own fur or grooming with paws. With another mouse: Proximity and interaction between mice. Pulling another mouse: While one mouse is climbing, the other pulls it by its mouth. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variances across groups were evaluated by Levene’s test. If variances were equal, a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’ or t-test post hoc was performed. For datasets with unequal variance and/or non-normal distributions, a non-parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Correlations were performed in JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. via multivariate platform and non-parametric Spearman’s ρ test. For all analyses, the threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. HU Increased Activated Microglia in the Hippocampus Increased CD68 levels are indicative of increased microglial activation. Hippocampal sections were stained to visualize and quantify CD68 protein expression (Figure 1A). Wild-type HU mice had a significantly greater number of CD68+ cells than normally loaded wild-type mice (Figure 1B). Interestingly, MCAT HU mice had a significantly lower CD68 count than wild-type HU mice (Figure 1B), indicating that mitochondrial catalase expressions can reduce HU induced microglia activations in the hippocampus.

Correlation of CD68 Count and Hippocampal Cytokines Correlation analysis was performed between hippocampal CD68 count and protein expression of hippocampal cytokines (cytokine raw data are described in [20,50]). In total, the expression of eight proteins (IL-1a, IL-3, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, RANTES, and MIP-3a) had a significant positive correlation with hippocampal CD68 counts (Figure 2). Five pro-inflammatory cytokines were previously identified to be affected by [20], and three of these cytokines are among the ones shown here to have a significant correlation between CD68 counts and cytokine profiles in the hippocampus (IL-3, IL-12, and IL-17).

Changes in Behavior Observed during Light and Dark Cycles Observed animal behaviors were categorized into “active” (Figure 3A), “exploration” (Figure 3B), “social interaction” (Figure 4), and “inactive” (including rest/sleep and non-directional movement during sleep) (Figure 5). During the light cycle, MCAT HU mice showed changes in behavior compared to wild-type HU mice, where reduced social behavior (Figure 4) and an increase in non-directed movement during sleep (Figure 5B) were observed.

All groups showed increased active behavior compared to the light cycle, as expected. Only MCAT HU mice showed increased exploratory behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 3B). For social behavior, only normally loaded mice showed increased behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 4). All groups but normally loaded MCAT mice had decreased rest/sleep behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 5A). During the dark cycle, MCAT HU mice showed higher exploratory behaviors compared to wild-type HU mice (Figure 3B) and higher active and exploratory behaviors compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 3A,B). For social behaviors during the dark cycle, wild-type HU mice showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded wild-type mice (Figure 4), while MCAT HU mice also showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 4). For inactive behavior, rest/sleep activities of normally loaded MCAT mice were greater than normally loaded wild-type mice, where MCAT HU mice were lower than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5A). Moreover, for non-directional movements during rest, wild-type HU mice had more activities than normally loaded wild-type mice, and MCAT HU mice had more activities than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5B). 3.4. Correlations of Categorized Behaviors with Plasma and Hippocampal Cytokines Next, we assessed correlations between categorized animal behavior during dark cycles (in which animals perform most activities) and cytokine protein expression in the hippocampus and in plasma (Figure 6) with the aim to identify potential biomarkers of simulated microgravity consequences. In the hippocampus, correlations, either positive or negative, were observed in 12 cytokines. The activity category with the most correlations was explorative behavior, which was correlated positively with G-CSF and Mip3a and negatively with INF γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, M-CSF, Mip2, and EPO (Figure 6). Next, social interactions were positively correlated with IL-4, Mip2, and EPO and negatively with G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and Mip3a (Figure 6). Inactive behavior correlated positively with INF γ (rho- 0.03, data not shown). For plasma cytokines, active behavior was positively correlated with G-CSF and KC and negatively correlated with Timp1. Inactive behavior was negatively correlated with KC and positively with Timp1 (rho- 0.003 and 0.02, respectively, data not shown). Exploration was positively correlated with IL-20 and negatively with Timp1 (Figure 6). Figure 6.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Microgravity experienced during prolonged spaceflight results in neurological consequences, CNS dysfunction, and potentially impairment in performances [51]. Rodent hindlimb-unloading head-down tilt models have been utilized in ground-based studies to elucidate stress responses in numerous tissues, the immune system, and CNS [52]. Further investigations on the mechanisms of these responses are paramount for the identification of potential biomarkers as well as the development of future countermeasures. Previously, we found that isolation also may impact the response to microgravity by masking its effects [20]. Thus, in this current study, we were interested in assessing the effect of simulated microgravity (without isolation with mice socially housed) on a subset of immune responses of the hippocampus and behavioral outcomes. The hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory, and any alterations in this region can have detrimental consequences on CNS function. HU in mice led to protein changes in the hippocampus, primarily in structural proteins and proteins involved in metabolism [53]. A previous study reported the upregulation of CD68 in the soleus [54] and increased microglia in spinal cord of male mice [18] that underwent HU. However, there remains a gap with respect to HU-induced CD68 responses in the brain. We found, in female mice that underwent HU, increased CD68 in the hippocampus, indicating an HU-induced increased activation of microglia. Deep-space missions will expose crew members to higher levels of radiation in addition to exposure to altered gravity. The exposure of low doses of high-LET radiation can induce inflammatory processes and can change cognition and behaviors [55]. Additionally, sex differences in cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF were observed in radiation exposure [56]. In accordance with our previous work and with most relevant space rodent studies to date [55,57,58], we chose females for this study. The additional reason for using females in our study was that, in studying male behavior, there are a lot of masking effects due to male-to-male aggression when housed in the same cage, and here, social housing was utilized. With the growing number of female astronauts, identifying these responses in females to space environment stressors is increasingly important. Sex differences are an important factor in the hippocampal stress response; thus, we plan to explore these responses to simulated spaceflight in our future studies and to assess if similar results will be seen in males. There are several limitations of the HU model vs. spaceflight. During HU, the forelimbs, head, and upper back remain weightbearing vs. the entire body unloading in space. The HU model does not include the stress of launch and landing, and fluid shifts are not identical. Despite these limitations, this model is widely used and is instrumental in demonstrating physiological changes that occur during unloading [59]. Sleep and ROS quenching have a reciprocal relationship; when there is a lack of sleep, the accumulation of ROS might cause adverse effects [60]. Melatonin, a sleep-inducing agent, decreased abnormal protein nitration, the accumulation of Aβ polypeptides, and extended the lifespan in mice Alzheimer’s model brains [61]. In our study, as expected, mice rest less during the dark cycle; interestingly, in the WT MCAT group, mice were sleeping for the same period of time during the day and night, which could indicate a shift in their circadian rhythm. HU mice present more non-directed movements during rest compared to WT, which is probably led by the discomfort of HU, and these differences will be investigated further in our future studies. Chronic stress is a risk factor for various mental and degenerative disorders, both the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are activated and elicit glucocorticoids and noradrenaline, respectively. These stress pathways have both simulating and suppressant effects on microglia depending on the specific environment [62]. Cytokines not only target microglia [8] but are also secreted by them, and their interactions differ in normal (where cytokines work as signaling molecules) vs. pathological states, where these pathways may spin out of control (e.g., cytokine storm) and cause a cycle of chronic neuroinflammation. Acute and chronic stress, a known circumstance of prolonged spaceflight, have also been shown to induce microglia activation resulting in an enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [10]. Mice that undergo HU have increased circulatory levels of corticosterone [20,48], an indicator of stress. We previously observed that HU resulted in changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines. Four out of these five cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, while IL-12 was downregulated. Additionally, HU elevated neutrophils and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [63] and IL-20 in plasma [20]. Here, hippocampal CD68 was correlated with eight cytokines and chemokines, primarily those involved with T cell responses, further indicating disruptions in the inflammatory status. Prolonged neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive deficits, mood disorders, and stress-related behavior [64]. In this study, twelve hippocampal cytokines and five circulatory cytokines were correlated with changes in exploratory and social behavior during the dark cycle. Additionally, we saw that hippocampal IL-1, IL-13, and Mip3a have positive correlations with both hippocampal microglia activation and negative correlations with social behavior. Similarly, hippocampal IL-10 and IL-12p70, which are positively correlated with activated microglia, have negative correlations with explorative behavior. IL-1 and IL-6 have previously been linked to sick behavior and fatigue, [65] and when neutralized, they ameliorated specific neuropsychiatric symptoms [66]. IL-10 and IL-12 are both produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Mip-3a is a chemokine recently shown to have an important role in the autoimmune pathogenesis of the central nervous system. IL-13 has been shown to control brain inflammation by enhancing activated microglia death and enhancing neuronal survival [67]. It has been suggested before that there is an interplay between cytokines in the CNS and behavior, which probably evolved to promote healing and self-isolating behavior to protect other individuals from becoming infected. However, when this balance is disturbed in age-related cognitive impairments and/or mood disorders, similar immune changes are observed: for example, elevated CCL-11 plasma levels in schizophrenic patients [68]. The negative correlation of the cytokines found here with exploratory behavior, together with the elevated microglial state in the hippocampus, might illuminate similar pathways. It has been shown that IL-10 and IL-12 (P70) levels predict the risk of COVID-19 progression in hypertensive patients [69]; in s similar manner, these cytokines could be used as biomarkers for behavioral and molecular changes driven by neuroinflammation. It is still unclear if cytokines drive stress-induced sickness behaviors or are a consequence of it, but since the impact of these changes is crucial to many behavioral pathologies, finding more links between immune and behavior changes is important for developing more specific therapies. Altered expression levels in the plasma that correlate with inactive behavior (Timp1 and KC) could be useful as biomarkers for astronauts or patients with sedentary lifestyle. The limitation of the correlations found in this study lays in its limited sample number; thus, these results must be verified in larger groups. Previous studies have shown that hindlimb unloading affects the blood–brain barrier’s integrity [70]; in future studies, it would be also interesting to assess whether peripherally infiltrating microglia such as monocytes are present in the brain of hindlimb-unloaded animals. A prolonged inflammatory state has been linked to an increase in oxidative damage [71,72]. Spaceflight and ground-based models have demonstrated oxidative stress affecting the brain and immune response, as reviewed previously [51,71]. Additionally, oxidative stress is associated with physiological and cellular changes in the CNS [71,73]. In an animal chronic social defeat, observed deficits in behavior were attributed to elevated levels of ROS and activated microglia. While activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia are also activated by cytokines released by damaged neurons. HU in mice has been shown to induce oxidative stress in the brain, resulting in lipid peroxidation and the activation of NF-κb [25], a transcription factor that induces the expression pro-inflammatory cytokines. This in turn, induces the formation of ROS, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation further perpetuating the cycle and a chronic inflammatory state. Therefore, we tested whether mitochondrial ROS is a potential mechanism for neuroimmune deficits caused by simulated microgravity. Previously we saw that mitochondrial ROS quenching reduced cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus and mitigated the effects of HU and of social isolation [20]. Here, we observed a reduction in hippocampal CD68 in MCAT mice that underwent HU compared to the WT, indicating an important role of ROS in HU-induced microglia activation and that it is a potential target for countermeasures (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab A schematic cascade of the neuro-consequences of spaceflight adapted from Mhatre et al. [48] with our findings highlighted (in orange oval). Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment/prevention of cognitive changes astronauts experience due to prolonged spaceflight. Microglia activation may be suitable candidates for examining this relationship. Microglia have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease [3], and they may be appropriate targets for prevention or treatment. Overall, our study sheds new light on the underlying mechanism of how simulated microgravity causes neuroinflammation, implicating microglial brain activation, and links this process to behavioral consequences. Additionally, we show that microglial activation in the hippocampus caused by simulated microgravity is mitigated by ROS quenching. Hence, in future studies, it would be interesting to investigate antioxidant treatments in both astronauts and patients with sedentary lifestyles.",

Copyright notice ID: 9695374 PMID: 36362993 Abstract Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth. Keywords: microgravity, CNS, hind limb unloading, microglia, ROS, MCAT1. Introduction Bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and isolation have negative effects on almost all systems of the human body, and understanding these effects has become a primary objective for enabling long-term space flights. Exposure to microgravity is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, but it might also have detrimental effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and cognition, since spaceflight results in significant volumetric changes in brain grey matter [1]. Furthermore, simulated microgravity in mice induced impairments in immune functions [2]. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are crucial for maintaining a healthy neural environment promoting homeostasis and responding to infection, or injury. Microglial activation can occur in response to a variety of triggers and is dependent on the type of pathological stressor or event [3]. Once activated, microglia not only primarily act as scavenger cells, removing debris and dying neurons [4], but also perform tissue repair and neural regeneration [5]. Microglia also act as second messengers by releasing a number of substances such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4,6]. Prolonged activations can lead to neuronal damage or death, as well as the activation of astrocytes, resulting in further endangerment to neurons and the further recruitment of microglia, thereby perpetuating the inflammatory state [7,8]. There are a number of potentially useful markers for specific microglia states [9]. Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) is a lysosomal protein expressed at low levels by resting microglia and at high levels by activated phagocytic microglia [7,10,11]. CD68 is commonly used to visualize activated microglia in inflammatory responses in the brain and is potentially a suitable candidate for further exploring microgravity-induced microglial activation. Studies have shown that microgravity and bedrest stimulate changes in immune cell response. Monocytes isolated from astronauts exhibit impaired function (reviewed in [12]). Furthermore, plasma concentrations of TNFα, IL-8, IL-1a, growth factors, and leukocyte recruitment chemokines have been observed to be increased in plasma following spaceflights [13]. Following the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the monocyte secretion of IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 significantly reduced, while IL-1β was elevated postflight [14]. During spaceflight, increased white blood cell count and decreased T cell function have been observed in astronaut crews [15]. Studies using blood collected from human bedrest models of head-down tilt-simulating headward fluid shifts in flight found changes in immune cells [16] and cytokine levels. After two-week hindlimb unloading (HU), a rodent model commonly used to simulate weightlessness, microgravity-induced cephalic fluid shifts, bedrest and anhedonia, the mRNA expression of numerous genes impacting immune response, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory was altered in mouse brains [17]. HU also increased microglia activations in spinal cord [18] and neural stem cells [19]. We previously observed an increase in IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17 in the hippocampus after prolonged HU [20], cytokines that are known to be produced and secreted by activated microglia [8,21], and astrocytes [22,23]. Altered gravity was also observed to downregulate ICAM-1 expression in vitro in murine BV-2 microglial cells, while a subtype of smaller cells of BV-2 microglial cells appeared and was assumed to be activated cells [24]. Overall, previous studies showed that microgravity and bedrest both induced immune response in the CNS, but the microglial activations in the hippocampus in in vivo mouse models have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that head-tilt bedrest will result in microglial activations in the hippocampus. It has been established that spaceflight and spaceflight-like stressors cause oxidative stress responses within the hippocampus [25]. Due to the incomplete mitochondrial metabolization of oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl are generated. Behavioral and cognitive changes were associated with altered measures of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and protein and DNA oxidation in the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions implicated in anxiety and spatial memory [26]. The increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to increased cytokine release from microglial cells, potentially indicating increased microglial activations [27,28]. Mitochondrial ROS is generated by activated microglia [29,30], and reducing its production is believed to be a suitable target to prevent the over-activation of microglia [27,28,31]. A mouse model for mitochondrial ROS quenching via the overexpression of the human catalase gene targeted toward the mitochondria (MCAT) has been previously utilized to investigate oxidative stress. MCAT mice have increased lifespan [32], improved age-dependent pathologies [33], reduced radiation-induced neurogenesis depletion [34], cognitive dysfunction, improved outcomes in models of neurological conditions including ataxia-telangiectasia [35], ALS [36], and Alzheimer’s disease [37]. MCAT mice also exhibit improved hippocampal spatial learning and contextual fear memory [26]. Previously, we showed that MCAT mice were protected from simulated microgravity-induced increases in cytokine expression in hippocampus. In our lab, in the MCAT mice, ROS quenching was demonstrated by measuring 4-HNE [38,39], catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation. We have also seen a strong genotype effect in the MCAT mice, with a significantly lower protein abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In a screen of forty-four cytokines and chemokines, fourteen (IFNγ, IL-4, IL-6,IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP-1, MCSF, RANTES, MCP-5, and IP-10) were downregulated in MCAT vs. WT mice [20]. These results suggest that the increased expression of these cytokines in wildtype hindlimb-unloaded mice is indictive of microglial activations and that mitochondrial ROS play an important role in microglial activation; thus, in this study, we used the MCAT mouse model to see if ROS quenching will mitigate HU-induced microglial activation. Understanding the correlations between molecular changes in the brain, behavior, and plasma markers could refine our understanding of the kinetics of neurodegenerative changes and help find early biomarkers before irreversible damage occurs. Increased cytokine expression and neuroinflammation are associated with changes in behavior. There is evidence that inflammatory factors TNFα and IL-1β are associated with increased sick behaviors [40,41,42]. Theses cytokines have also been implicated in anorexic-like behavior [43]. IFNα is known to induce depression in humans [44], and TNFα is involved in depressive-like behavior as well [45]. In a mouse model, HU resulted in anxiety-like behaviors, which were associated with significant changes in the pattern of neural oscillations in the hippocampus [46]. Oxidative stress enhanced this response, and the inhibition of ROS reduced HU-induced anxiety [47]. We previously reported significantly reduced CD4+ T cell numbers and elevation in twelve cytokines in singly, but not socially, housed mice under normal loading conditions [48]. Singly housed mice exposed to simulated microgravity downregulated only one cytokine, IL-13, which is involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and these changes were mitigated in the MCAT mouse model [20]. These data suggest that, under these conditions, social isolation and HU may reflect an epistatic interaction. In this study, we investigated the role of HU alone, without the additional isolation effect, in socially housed animals. MCAT mice were utilized to explore the association between oxidative stress and microglia activation in simulated microgravity. Correlations between microglia activation, cytokine expression and behavior were calculated to further our understanding of the effects of altered gravity on the CNS. In this study, we aim to determine the role of microglia, ROS pathways, and behavior, following head-tilt bedrest to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism behind neuroimmune changes, thus paving the way for future therapies. We hypothesize that head-tilt bedrest will affect microglia activation in the hippocampus and that, in the MCAT model, quenching ROS will mitigate these changes.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Strains In this study, a subset of the socially housed (2 per cage) sixteen-week-old female wild type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice was utilized as described in [20] and [48]. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6. Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033 Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC NAS-16-007-Y2) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC).2.2. Hindlimb Unloading to Produce Head-Down Tilt Mice were assigned to one of four experimental groups (See Supplementary Figure S1; n = 8/group unless otherwise stated) and housed in a custom caging system as previously described [48]. In accordance with our previous work and with most space rodent studies to date, we chose females for this study. Socially housed, normally loaded (NL) controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages. All HU groups were acclimated for three days in HU cages prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23–24 °C with a 12 h light: dark cycle (6 AM:6 PM lights on:off). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlets (Ancare, NY, USA) were provided for enrichment. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the start of HU via CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.2.3. Sample Collection and Immunohistochemistry The left-brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at −20 °C to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in a mild lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%, Protease Inhibitors (Millipore-Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA) [49]. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000× g for 10 min and supernatants were aliquoted and flash frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Cytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates was analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44-Plex-MD44 (EVE Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada) in which concentration standards are run for each cytokine. To verify the Multiplex method, IL-3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat# ab113345-IL-3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 23225). Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as described for hippocampal homogenates. The results and raw data of plasma and hippocampal cytokines are shown in Rubinstein et al., 2021 [20], and used here for correlations. The right brain hemisphere was embedded in 4% PFA overnight and transferred the next day into 30% sucrose-PBS solution for cryoprotection. After sucrose impregnation, brains were embedded in OCT (OCT compound 4583, Sakura, Nagano, Japan) and frozen at −80 °C until cryosectioning. The brains were sectioned in a cryostat at 40 microns and stained for CD68. Slide-mounted sections were 1x-TBS-buffered at a pH of 7.3 and washed in H2O2 for antigen unmasking. Next, the primary antibody, rat-αmouse CD68 (Abcam ab53444, dilution 1:2000), was introduced in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum After additional TBS washes, the secondary antibody was introduced (biotinylated rabbit-αrat, dilution 1:200 (Vector BA4001) in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum). Amplification and fluorescent staining were performed with a Fluorescein Tyramide System (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA, NEL701A001KT), as described by the manufacturer. The indiscriminate nuclear staining agent 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Labs, Mowry Ave Newark, CA, USA Vectashield, H-1200-10) was used to identify hippocampal regions, and the Allen Brain Atlas was used for reference (http://mouse.brain-map.org/) We chose to analyze 4 brains from each group except NL MCAT group in which 5 brains were analyzed, all with representative sections across the entire hippocampus (CA1/2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)). We used 20X magnification, and 9–15 photos per hippocampus were taken. The unbiased microglia counting in each photo was performed manually counting microglia in each frame, using Image J program (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).2.4. Mouse Behavioral Analysis Video surveillance: A commercially available surveillance system that allows for both day and night image captures was utilized. The Lorex 4K UHD 8-channel Fusion NVR Security System with 8 “Smart Deterrence” 4K Cameras was utilized. This cage system was designed to not disturb ongoing behavior. The camera was placed horizontally to the cage, and it is affixed to a surface at a distance enabling visibility and the capture of full ambulatory motion and all species’ typical behaviors. Video Sampling: Mice were recorded in their home cage continuously for a 24 h period, and samples of 15 min videos were analyzed using Excel to manually score the duration of various behaviors; time samples were at least 2 h away from the light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions to ensure the acquisition of stable activity levels during each phase of the diurnal cycle. We sampled 15 min from the following time points: 8 AM, 11:30 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM, 12 AM, 2 AM, and 4 AM. Each behavior graph represents the percentage of time the animal spent in engaging in a specific category from the total time measured. Videos images were manually scored in Excel and analyzed for a range of typical mouse behaviors that would indicate normal functioning. To obtain a more general behavioral profile, behaviors were pooled into the following categories: “exploratory”, “social interaction”, “active”, and “rest/sleep”: Exploratory Behavior: burrowing in bedding, climbing, exploratory sniffing, and exploratory ambulation; Social Interaction: chasing, sniffing another mouse, allogrooming, nestlet social engagement, mounting, socializing with another mouse, and pulling another mouse. Active Behavior: active behavior contains exploratory behavior, eating, drinking, sniffing, nestlet manipulation, self-grooming, ambulation, and all social interaction behaviors; Rest/Sleep: rest/Sleep behavior contains sleep and non-directed movement. 2.5. Behavioral Categories Definitions Eating: Mouth is on food. Mouse has visible food in its forepaws and is using its mouth to interact with food piece. Drinking: The animal rears up and licks the nozzle of the drinker. Borrowing: Burrowing in its bedding, which involves the paws and snout and exploring different cage parts. Chasing: Normally loaded animals only. Movement 3 or more steps towards the other mouse, while the other mouse is moving away. Inactive: Stationary in one spot with most of its body not moving. Climbing: Using paws to grip on cage in order to lift body and paws off the ground. Sniffing other mouse: One mouse’s nose in near proximity of another mouse. Alogrooming: Grooming that occurs when one mouse is grooming another mouse. Non-directed movement (during rest/sleep): Movement that is localized to a few grids (3 grids) and does not use more than three-fourths of the animal’s body. Sustained for no longer than 2 s. Exploratory ambulation: Movement that includes sniffing and meets the definition of Stanford’s four stages of exploration: search, attend, approach, and investigate while moving across multiple grids. Nestlet social engagement (described in Tahimic et al., 2019 [48]): In social HU, when one mouse extends beyond the halfway section of the shared cage and grabs a nestlet. Nestlet manipulation: Mouse directly touching nestlet with mouth and/or forepaws. Mounting: Normally loaded animals only. Mouse climbs on top of another mouse or has another mouse on top of it. Sniffing (exploratory): Moving ahead with the nose held in the air. Ambulation: Moving across multiple grids. Self-grooming: Mouse licking its own fur or grooming with paws. With another mouse: Proximity and interaction between mice. Pulling another mouse: While one mouse is climbing, the other pulls it by its mouth.2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variances across groups were evaluated by Levene’s test. If variances were equal, a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’ or t-test post hoc was performed. For datasets with unequal variance and/or non-normal distributions, a non-parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Correlations were performed in JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. via multivariate platform and non-parametric Spearman’s ρ test. For all analyses, the threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.3. Results 3.1. HU Increased Activated Microglia in the Hippocampus Increased CD68 levels are indicative of increased microglial activation. Hippocampal sections were stained to visualize and quantify CD68 protein expression (Figure 1A). Wild-type HU mice had a significantly greater number of CD68+ cells than normally loaded wild-type mice (Figure 1B). Interestingly, MCAT HU mice had a significantly lower CD68 count than wild-type HU mice (Figure 1B), indicating that mitochondrial catalase expressions can reduce HU induced microglia activations in the hippocampus.

Correlation of CD68 Count and Hippocampal Cytokines Correlation analysis was performed between hippocampal CD68 count and protein expression of hippocampal cytokines (cytokine raw data are described in [20,50]). In total, the expression of eight proteins (IL-1a, IL-3, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, RANTES, and MIP-3a) had a significant positive correlation with hippocampal CD68 counts (Figure 2). Five pro-inflammatory cytokines were previously identified to be affected by [20], and three of these cytokines are among the ones shown here to have a significant correlation between CD68 counts and cytokine profiles in the hippocampus (IL-3, IL-12, and IL-17).

Changes in Behavior Observed during Light and Dark Cycles Observed animal behaviors were categorized into “active” (Figure 3A), “exploration” (Figure 3B), “social interaction” (Figure 4), and “inactive” (including rest/sleep and non-directional movement during sleep) (Figure 5). During the light cycle, MCAT HU mice showed changes in behavior compared to wild-type HU mice, where reduced social behavior (Figure 4) and an increase in non-directed movement during sleep (Figure 5B) were observed.

All groups showed increased active behavior compared to the light cycle, as expected. Only MCAT HU mice showed increased exploratory behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 3B). For social behavior, only normally loaded mice showed increased behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 4). All groups but normally loaded MCAT mice had decreased rest/sleep behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 5A). During the dark cycle, MCAT HU mice showed higher exploratory behaviors compared to wild-type HU mice (Figure 3B) and higher active and exploratory behaviors compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 3A,B). For social behaviors during the dark cycle, wild-type HU mice showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded wild-type mice (Figure 4), while MCAT HU mice also showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 4). For inactive behavior, rest/sleep activities of normally loaded MCAT mice were greater than normally loaded wild-type mice, where MCAT HU mice were lower than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5A). Moreover, for non-directional movements during rest, wild-type HU mice had more activities than normally loaded wild-type mice, and MCAT HU mice had more activities than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5B).3.4. Correlations of Categorized Behaviors with Plasma and Hippocampal Cytokines Next, we assessed correlations between categorized animal behavior during dark cycles (in which animals perform most activities) and cytokine protein expression in the hippocampus and in plasma (Figure 6) with the aim to identify potential biomarkers of simulated microgravity consequences. In the hippocampus, correlations, either positive or negative, were observed in 12 cytokines. The activity category with the most correlations was explorative behavior, which was correlated positively with G-CSF and Mip3a and negatively with INF γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, M-CSF, Mip2, and EPO (Figure 6). Next, social interactions were positively correlated with IL-4, Mip2, and EPO and negatively with G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and Mip3a (Figure 6). Inactive behavior correlated positively with INF γ (rho- 0.03, data not shown). For plasma cytokines, active behavior was positively correlated with G-CSF and KC and negatively correlated with Timp1. Inactive behavior was negatively correlated with KC and positively with Timp1 (rho- 0.003 and 0.02, respectively, data not shown). Exploration was positively correlated with IL-20 and negatively with Timp1 (Figure 6). Figure 6.

Discussion Microgravity experienced during prolonged spaceflight results in neurological consequences, CNS dysfunction, and potentially impairment in performances [51]. Rodent hindlimb-unloading head-down tilt models have been utilized in ground-based studies to elucidate stress responses in numerous tissues, the immune system, and CNS [52]. Further investigations on the mechanisms of these responses are paramount for the identification of potential biomarkers as well as the development of future countermeasures. Previously, we found that isolation also may impact the response to microgravity by masking its effects [20]. Thus, in this current study, we were interested in assessing the effect of simulated microgravity (without isolation with mice socially housed) on a subset of immune responses of the hippocampus and behavioral outcomes. The hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory, and any alterations in this region can have detrimental consequences on CNS function. HU in mice led to protein changes in the hippocampus, primarily in structural proteins and proteins involved in metabolism [53]. A previous study reported the upregulation of CD68 in the soleus [54] and increased microglia in spinal cord of male mice [18] that underwent HU. However, there remains a gap with respect to HU-induced CD68 responses in the brain. We found, in female mice that underwent HU, increased CD68 in the hippocampus, indicating an HU-induced increased activation of microglia. Deep-space missions will expose crew members to higher levels of radiation in addition to exposure to altered gravity. The exposure of low doses of high-LET radiation can induce inflammatory processes and can change cognition and behaviors [55]. Additionally, sex differences in cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF were observed in radiation exposure [56]. In accordance with our previous work and with most relevant space rodent studies to date [55,57,58], we chose females for this study. The additional reason for using females in our study was that, in studying male behavior, there are a lot of masking effects due to male-to-male aggression when housed in the same cage, and here, social housing was utilized. With the growing number of female astronauts, identifying these responses in females to space environment stressors is increasingly important. Sex differences are an important factor in the hippocampal stress response; thus, we plan to explore these responses to simulated spaceflight in our future studies and to assess if similar results will be seen in males. There are several limitations of the HU model vs. spaceflight. During HU, the forelimbs, head, and upper back remain weightbearing vs. the entire body unloading in space. The HU model does not include the stress of launch and landing, and fluid shifts are not identical. Despite these limitations, this model is widely used and is instrumental in demonstrating physiological changes that occur during unloading [59]. Sleep and ROS quenching have a reciprocal relationship; when there is a lack of sleep, the accumulation of ROS might cause adverse effects [60]. Melatonin, a sleep-inducing agent, decreased abnormal protein nitration, the accumulation of Aβ polypeptides, and extended the lifespan in mice Alzheimer’s model brains [61]. In our study, as expected, mice rest less during the dark cycle; interestingly, in the WT MCAT group, mice were sleeping for the same period of time during the day and night, which could indicate a shift in their circadian rhythm. HU mice present more non-directed movements during rest compared to WT, which is probably led by the discomfort of HU, and these differences will be investigated further in our future studies. Chronic stress is a risk factor for various mental and degenerative disorders, both the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are activated and elicit glucocorticoids and noradrenaline, respectively. These stress pathways have both simulating and suppressant effects on microglia depending on the specific environment [62]. Cytokines not only target microglia [8] but are also secreted by them, and their interactions differ in normal (where cytokines work as signaling molecules) vs. pathological states, where these pathways may spin out of control (e.g., cytokine storm) and cause a cycle of chronic neuroinflammation. Acute and chronic stress, a known circumstance of prolonged spaceflight, have also been shown to induce microglia activation resulting in an enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [10]. Mice that undergo HU have increased circulatory levels of corticosterone [20,48], an indicator of stress. We previously observed that HU resulted in changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines. Four out of these five cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, while IL-12 was downregulated. Additionally, HU elevated neutrophils and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [63] and IL-20 in plasma [20]. Here, hippocampal CD68 was correlated with eight cytokines and chemokines, primarily those involved with T cell responses, further indicating disruptions in the inflammatory status. Prolonged neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive deficits, mood disorders, and stress-related behavior [64]. In this study, twelve hippocampal cytokines and five circulatory cytokines were correlated with changes in exploratory and social behavior during the dark cycle. Additionally, we saw that hippocampal IL-1, IL-13, and Mip3a have positive correlations with both hippocampal microglia activation and negative correlations with social behavior. Similarly, hippocampal IL-10 and IL-12p70, which are positively correlated with activated microglia, have negative correlations with explorative behavior. IL-1 and IL-6 have previously been linked to sick behavior and fatigue, [65] and when neutralized, they ameliorated specific neuropsychiatric symptoms [66]. IL-10 and IL-12 are both produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Mip-3a is a chemokine recently shown to have an important role in the autoimmune pathogenesis of the central nervous system. IL-13 has been shown to control brain inflammation by enhancing activated microglia death and enhancing neuronal survival [67]. It has been suggested before that there is an interplay between cytokines in the CNS and behavior, which probably evolved to promote healing and self-isolating behavior to protect other individuals from becoming infected. However, when this balance is disturbed in age-related cognitive impairments and/or mood disorders, similar immune changes are observed: for example, elevated CCL-11 plasma levels in schizophrenic patients [68]. The negative correlation of the cytokines found here with exploratory behavior, together with the elevated microglial state in the hippocampus, might illuminate similar pathways. It has been shown that IL-10 and IL-12 (P70) levels predict the risk of COVID-19 progression in hypertensive patients [69]; in s similar manner, these cytokines could be used as biomarkers for behavioral and molecular changes driven by neuroinflammation. It is still unclear if cytokines drive stress-induced sickness behaviors or are a consequence of it, but since the impact of these changes is crucial to many behavioral pathologies, finding more links between immune and behavior changes is important for developing more specific therapies. Altered expression levels in the plasma that correlate with inactive behavior (Timp1 and KC) could be useful as biomarkers for astronauts or patients with sedentary lifestyle. The limitation of the correlations found in this study lays in its limited sample number; thus, these results must be verified in larger groups. Previous studies have shown that hindlimb unloading affects the blood–brain barrier’s integrity [70]; in future studies, it would be also interesting to assess whether peripherally infiltrating microglia such as monocytes are present in the brain of hindlimb-unloaded animals. A prolonged inflammatory state has been linked to an increase in oxidative damage [71,72]. Spaceflight and ground-based models have demonstrated oxidative stress affecting the brain and immune response, as reviewed previously [51,71]. Additionally, oxidative stress is associated with physiological and cellular changes in the CNS [71,73]. In an animal chronic social defeat, observed deficits in behavior were attributed to elevated levels of ROS and activated microglia. While activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia are also activated by cytokines released by damaged neurons. HU in mice has been shown to induce oxidative stress in the brain, resulting in lipid peroxidation and the activation of NF-κb [25], a transcription factor that induces the expression pro-inflammatory cytokines. This in turn, induces the formation of ROS, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation further perpetuating the cycle and a chronic inflammatory state. Therefore, we tested whether mitochondrial ROS is a potential mechanism for neuroimmune deficits caused by simulated microgravity. Previously we saw that mitochondrial ROS quenching reduced cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus and mitigated the effects of HU and of social isolation [20]. Here, we observed a reduction in hippocampal CD68 in MCAT mice that underwent HU compared to the WT, indicating an important role of ROS in HU-induced microglia activation and that it is a potential target for countermeasures (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab A schematic cascade of the neuro-consequences of spaceflight adapted from Mhatre et al. [48] with our findings highlighted (in orange oval).Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment/prevention of cognitive changes astronauts experience due to prolonged spaceflight. Microglia activation may be suitable candidates for examining this relationship. Microglia have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease [3], and they may be appropriate targets for prevention or treatment. Overall, our study sheds new light on the underlying mechanism of how simulated microgravity causes neuroinflammation, implicating microglial brain activation, and links this process to behavioral consequences. Additionally, we show that microglial activation in the hippocampus caused by simulated microgravity is mitigated by ROS quenching. Hence, in future studies, it would be interesting to investigate antioxidant treatments in both astronauts and patients with sedentary lifestyles.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life12111838/s1, Figure S1: Experimental design.

    "title": "Structural and functional properties of bone are compromised in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease. Keywords: ALS mouse model, bone strength, bone biomechanics, fracture toughness, microCT",
    "introduction": "Introduction In addition to severe skeletal muscle deterioration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has recently been linked to increased incidences of skeletal fractures, as well as elevated serum bone turnover markers in ALS patients (1, 2). These patients exhibit decreased bone mineral density, which is associated with increased fracture risks (3, 4). It is postulated that reduced mechanical load from skeletal muscle atrophy contributes to bone loss, but the exact alterations in bone functional, or biomechanical, properties are still unclear. The ALS SOD1G93A mouse model has recently been shown to have reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass (5). This bone loss was due to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption in 16-week-old SOD1G93A mice. While this prior study characterized alterations in molecular, cellular, and structural properties of skeleton in the ALS mouse model, the impact of the SOD1G93A mutation on functional properties of the skeleton is still unknown. By assessing the biomechanical properties of long bones from these mice, we can infer alterations in the functional properties of bone as a consequence of ALS. Thus, we examined bone mass, microarchitecture, and biomechanics in ALS SOD1G93A mice. We hypothesized that bone microstructure and biomechanical outcomes, such as the bending stiffness and moments and fracture toughness, will be lower in ALS SOD1G93A mice compared to their littermate controls.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals: We used 16-week-old ALS SOD1G93A female mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and their sex- and age-matched littermate controls (n = 9–10/group) for this study. These same animals had been previously demonstrated to exhibit decline in electrophysiological and functional parameters in the skeletal muscle (6). Mice were housed 3–5 per cage, maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Specimen harvesting and preparation: After being cleaned of its soft tissue, the left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C until imaging by microcomputed tomography (microCT) and mechanical testing by unnotched three point bending. The right femur was wrapped in saline soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C until fracture toughness testing. The right tibia was stored similarly until cyclic reference point indentation testing. Mechanical testing: The left frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell, Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). To determine the bending stiffness (N•mm2), maximum moment (N•mm), and failure moment (N•mm), femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/sec with the two lower support points spaced 8 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz. Estimated elastic modulus (Effective modulus, MPa) was calculated by using the moment of inertia derived from microCT scans (7). To assess the effects of ALS on resistance to fracture in the skeleton, the right frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to fracture toughness testing (8). A through-wall notch was first created on the anterior surface of the femur using a low-speed saw and polished with a razor blade. After microCT characterization of the notch dimensions, femurs were subjected to three-point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell; Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) with a span length of 8 mm and preload at −0.4 N and a constant displacement rate of 0.001 mm/s to failure. Force-displacement data and the critical stress intensity factor (Kc; fracture toughness) were analyzed and calculated by MatLab R2011b (MathWorks, Natick, MA): Kc=FbPcSRoπ(Ro4−Ri4)πRmθc where Pc is the maximum load, S is the span length, Ro and Ri are the mean outer and inner radii of the femoral cortex, Rm is the average of Ro and Ri, θc is the initial crack angle, and Fb is the geometry factor. Ro, Ri, and θc were determined from microCT images of the notched femurs. In addition to assessing the whole bone mechanical properties, we assessed cortical bone matrix properties by cyclic reference point indentation (Biodent 1000; Active Life Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) (9). The system was equipped with a 90° conical, 2.5 μm radius tip test probe. Indentation tests were conducted at a maximum force of 2 N at 2 Hz for 10 cycles. Three indentation measurements of 10 cycles each were taken at the distal end of the tibia diaphysis in the medial quadrant, a minimum of 500 μm apart, and averaged per specimen. Outcomes included total indentation distance (TID, μm), indentation distance increase (increase in indentation distance of the last cycle relative to the first cycle, IDI, μm), and creep indentation distance (CID, μm) (10). Bone microarchitecture: Micro-computed tomographic (µCT) imaging was performed on the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur using a high-resolution desktop imaging system (µCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) in accordance with the ASBMR guidelines for the use of µCT in rodents (11). Scans were acquired using a 10 µm3 isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 200 ms integration time, and were subjected to Gaussian filtration. We determined femoral length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end of femoral condyles on µCT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that we analyzed began 200 µm (20 slices) proximal to the distal growth plate and extended proximally 1.3 mm (130 slices). Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55% of the bone length below the femoral head and extended 500 µm (50 slices) distally. Thresholds of 456 and 700 mg HA/cm3 were used for evaluation of trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), thickness (Tb.Th, µm), number (Tb.N, μm−1) and separation (Tb.Sp, µm). Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (TMD, mg HA/mm3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, µm), total cross-sectional and cortical bone areas (mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia (Imax and Imin , mm4). Statistical analysis: All data were checked for normality, and standard descriptive statistics were computed. Two-tailed student t-test was used to test for differences between groups. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SEM, unless noted.",
    "results": "Results Both trabecular and cortical bone mass and microarchitecture were deficient in the SOD1G93A mice compared to controls (Table 1). In particular, trabecular BV/TV was 54% lower in ALS mice than controls (p = 0.0002, Fig 1), largely attributable to a decrease in trabecular thickness (−41%, p<0.001). Trabecular separation and number did not differ between ALS SOD1G93A mice and their littermate controls. Femoral cortical bone thickness and area were lower by 17% (p < 0.0001) and 18% (p = 0.0002), respectively, in ALS mice compared to their littermate controls (Figure 1, Table 1). While the total bone area and cortical bone area fraction did not differ, cortical tissue mineral density was 3% lower in ALS SOD1G93A mice (p < 0.0001). The maximum area moment of inertia was 21% lower (p = 0.002) in ALS SOD1G93A mice. Table 1: Femoral trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture, assessed by µCT (mean ± SEM).

    "discussion": "Discussion While the muscular consequences of ALS have been extensively studied, the effects of ALS on skeleton fragility are less well understood. Our results demonstrate that the whole bone mechanical properties are compromised in ALS SOD1G93A mice. Specifically, the bending stiffness, failure and maximum moments, and fracture toughness were lower in SOD1G93A mice compared to age- and sex-matched littermate controls. In addition, we found that femoral trabecular and cortical bone mass and microstructure are compromised in ALS SOD1G93A mice, consistent with a prior report (5). It is likely that the lower femoral bending properties in ALS SOD1G93A mice are due primarily to a secondary effect of impaired muscle function and reduced physical activity in these mice, rather than a direct effect of the SOD1G93A mutation on bone. In our study, ALS mice showed a very low compound motor action potential amplitude (15.4 ± 2.8 mV) and markedly reduced motor unit number estimate (38.8 ± 6.5 Motor Units) compared to values observed in healthy animals (6, 12–14). In addition, clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that ALS leads to decreased muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and strength (13, 15, 16). Decreased muscle cross-sectional area has been correlated with decreased bone area (17), which can lead to increased fracture risk (18). Also, bed rest studies demonstrate that calf muscle cross sectional area decreases more rapidly compared to bone mineral content in the tibial epiphysis (19). This rapid decline in muscle function leads to reduced mechanical loading environment on bone, which subsequently leads to reduced bone mass and area as the bone adapts to the reduced mechanical loads (20). Stimulating muscle contractions in hindlimb suspended rats prevents bone loss associated with unloading, providing evidence of the key connection between of muscular contraction and bone metabolism (21). Altogether, these studies suggest that functional impairment of bone in ALS SOD1G93A mice is secondary to declines in neuromuscular function. While reduced bone strength is likely largely secondary to impairments in skeletal muscle function in ALS SOD1G93A mice, clinical studies suggest that the skeletal deficits may occur independent of skeletal muscle deficits, as the increased incidence of bone fractures precedes the ALS diagnosis by as much as 10 years (1, 22). In ALS SOD1G93A mice, mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in cortical bone osteocytes due to accumulation of mutant SOD1G93A protein (23). To determine if mitochondrial dysfunction continues despite absence of skeletal muscle atrophy, mutant SOD1G93A protein was overexpressed in the osteocytic cell line MLO-Y4 cells. In addition to increased mitochondrial dysfunction, MLO-Y4 cells overexpressing SOD1G93A protein showed increased apoptosis. Osteocyte apoptosis is associated with increased RANKL, which promotes osteoclastic bone resorption and subsequent bone loss and microarchitectural deterioration (24). These studies suggest that in addition to reduced mechanical loading on bone due to skeletal muscle atrophy, altered bone cell homeostasis mutation may contribute to skeletal fragility and increased skeletal fracture risk in ALS patients. Limitations of current studies include a lack of functional assessment of bone in male ALS mice. Fracture risk may differ in male versus female ALS patients, as studies in similarly-aged healthy cohorts show that women have up to a 4-fold higher fracture incidence than men (25). Also, to determine the underlying cause of increased fracture incidence prior to ALS diagnosis, future studies should examine bone functional assessments at earlier time points in the ALS SOD1G93A mice. Finally, since SOD1G93A mutation is only presented in a small fraction of ALS patients, other mouse models with different genetic mutations (C9orf72, TDP-43, FUS, VCP) that also lead to ALS should be examined to determine if bone functional properties are also similarly altered in these models (26). In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate that in addition to impairment of skeletal muscle function, ALS SOD1G93A mice exhibit skeletal fragility, as indicated by reduced femoral bending properties and fracture toughness compared to control mice. These results have important implications. As new treatments are introduced that extend the survival of ALS patients, targeted therapies to prevent skeletal fractures should also be considered, including drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, and drugs that promote bone formation, such as teriparatide or abaloparatide. Ultimately, fracture prevention may be proven to be an important aspect of sustaining quality of life among longer-surviving ALS patients.",

Copyright notice ID: 6141014 MSID: MS1503675 PMID: 29569488 The publisher's version of this article is available at Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener Abstract In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease. Keywords: ALS mouse model, bone strength, bone biomechanics, fracture toughness, microCTIntroduction In addition to severe skeletal muscle deterioration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has recently been linked to increased incidences of skeletal fractures, as well as elevated serum bone turnover markers in ALS patients (1, 2). These patients exhibit decreased bone mineral density, which is associated with increased fracture risks (3, 4). It is postulated that reduced mechanical load from skeletal muscle atrophy contributes to bone loss, but the exact alterations in bone functional, or biomechanical, properties are still unclear. The ALS SOD1G93A mouse model has recently been shown to have reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass (5). This bone loss was due to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption in 16-week-old SOD1G93A mice. While this prior study characterized alterations in molecular, cellular, and structural properties of skeleton in the ALS mouse model, the impact of the SOD1G93A mutation on functional properties of the skeleton is still unknown. By assessing the biomechanical properties of long bones from these mice, we can infer alterations in the functional properties of bone as a consequence of ALS. Thus, we examined bone mass, microarchitecture, and biomechanics in ALS SOD1G93A mice. We hypothesized that bone microstructure and biomechanical outcomes, such as the bending stiffness and moments and fracture toughness, will be lower in ALS SOD1G93A mice compared to their littermate controls.Materials and Methods Animals: We used 16-week-old ALS SOD1G93A female mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and their sex- and age-matched littermate controls (n = 9–10/group) for this study. These same animals had been previously demonstrated to exhibit decline in electrophysiological and functional parameters in the skeletal muscle (6). Mice were housed 3–5 per cage, maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Specimen harvesting and preparation: After being cleaned of its soft tissue, the left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C until imaging by microcomputed tomography (microCT) and mechanical testing by unnotched three point bending. The right femur was wrapped in saline soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C until fracture toughness testing. The right tibia was stored similarly until cyclic reference point indentation testing.Mechanical testing: The left frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell, Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). To determine the bending stiffness (N•mm2), maximum moment (N•mm), and failure moment (N•mm), femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/sec with the two lower support points spaced 8 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz. Estimated elastic modulus (Effective modulus, MPa) was calculated by using the moment of inertia derived from microCT scans (7). To assess the effects of ALS on resistance to fracture in the skeleton, the right frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to fracture toughness testing (8). A through-wall notch was first created on the anterior surface of the femur using a low-speed saw and polished with a razor blade. After microCT characterization of the notch dimensions, femurs were subjected to three-point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell; Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) with a span length of 8 mm and preload at −0.4 N and a constant displacement rate of 0.001 mm/s to failure. Force-displacement data and the critical stress intensity factor (Kc; fracture toughness) were analyzed and calculated by MatLab R2011b (MathWorks, Natick, MA): Kc=FbPcSRoπ(Ro4−Ri4)πRmθc where Pc is the maximum load, S is the span length, Ro and Ri are the mean outer and inner radii of the femoral cortex, Rm is the average of Ro and Ri, θc is the initial crack angle, and Fb is the geometry factor. Ro, Ri, and θc were determined from microCT images of the notched femurs. In addition to assessing the whole bone mechanical properties, we assessed cortical bone matrix properties by cyclic reference point indentation (Biodent 1000; Active Life Scientific, Santa Barbara, CA) (9). The system was equipped with a 90° conical, 2.5 μm radius tip test probe. Indentation tests were conducted at a maximum force of 2 N at 2 Hz for 10 cycles. Three indentation measurements of 10 cycles each were taken at the distal end of the tibia diaphysis in the medial quadrant, a minimum of 500 μm apart, and averaged per specimen. Outcomes included total indentation distance (TID, μm), indentation distance increase (increase in indentation distance of the last cycle relative to the first cycle, IDI, μm), and creep indentation distance (CID, μm) (10).Bone microarchitecture: Micro-computed tomographic (µCT) imaging was performed on the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur using a high-resolution desktop imaging system (µCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) in accordance with the ASBMR guidelines for the use of µCT in rodents (11). Scans were acquired using a 10 µm3 isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 200 ms integration time, and were subjected to Gaussian filtration. We determined femoral length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end of femoral condyles on µCT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that we analyzed began 200 µm (20 slices) proximal to the distal growth plate and extended proximally 1.3 mm (130 slices). Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55% of the bone length below the femoral head and extended 500 µm (50 slices) distally. Thresholds of 456 and 700 mg HA/cm3 were used for evaluation of trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), thickness (Tb.Th, µm), number (Tb.N, μm−1) and separation (Tb.Sp, µm). Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (TMD, mg HA/mm3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, µm), total cross-sectional and cortical bone areas (mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia (Imax and Imin , mm4).Statistical analysis: All data were checked for normality, and standard descriptive statistics were computed. Two-tailed student t-test was used to test for differences between groups. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SEM, unless noted.Results Both trabecular and cortical bone mass and microarchitecture were deficient in the SOD1G93A mice compared to controls (Table 1). In particular, trabecular BV/TV was 54% lower in ALS mice than controls (p = 0.0002, Fig 1), largely attributable to a decrease in trabecular thickness (−41%, p<0.001). Trabecular separation and number did not differ between ALS SOD1G93A mice and their littermate controls. Femoral cortical bone thickness and area were lower by 17% (p < 0.0001) and 18% (p = 0.0002), respectively, in ALS mice compared to their littermate controls (Figure 1, Table 1). While the total bone area and cortical bone area fraction did not differ, cortical tissue mineral density was 3% lower in ALS SOD1G93A mice (p < 0.0001). The maximum area moment of inertia was 21% lower (p = 0.002) in ALS SOD1G93A mice. Table 1: Femoral trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture, assessed by µCT (mean ± SEM).

Error bars represent one SEM.Discussion While the muscular consequences of ALS have been extensively studied, the effects of ALS on skeleton fragility are less well understood. Our results demonstrate that the whole bone mechanical properties are compromised in ALS SOD1G93A mice. Specifically, the bending stiffness, failure and maximum moments, and fracture toughness were lower in SOD1G93A mice compared to age- and sex-matched littermate controls. In addition, we found that femoral trabecular and cortical bone mass and microstructure are compromised in ALS SOD1G93A mice, consistent with a prior report (5). It is likely that the lower femoral bending properties in ALS SOD1G93A mice are due primarily to a secondary effect of impaired muscle function and reduced physical activity in these mice, rather than a direct effect of the SOD1G93A mutation on bone. In our study, ALS mice showed a very low compound motor action potential amplitude (15.4 ± 2.8 mV) and markedly reduced motor unit number estimate (38.8 ± 6.5 Motor Units) compared to values observed in healthy animals (6, 12–14). In addition, clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that ALS leads to decreased muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and strength (13, 15, 16). Decreased muscle cross-sectional area has been correlated with decreased bone area (17), which can lead to increased fracture risk (18). Also, bed rest studies demonstrate that calf muscle cross sectional area decreases more rapidly compared to bone mineral content in the tibial epiphysis (19). This rapid decline in muscle function leads to reduced mechanical loading environment on bone, which subsequently leads to reduced bone mass and area as the bone adapts to the reduced mechanical loads (20). Stimulating muscle contractions in hindlimb suspended rats prevents bone loss associated with unloading, providing evidence of the key connection between of muscular contraction and bone metabolism (21). Altogether, these studies suggest that functional impairment of bone in ALS SOD1G93A mice is secondary to declines in neuromuscular function. While reduced bone strength is likely largely secondary to impairments in skeletal muscle function in ALS SOD1G93A mice, clinical studies suggest that the skeletal deficits may occur independent of skeletal muscle deficits, as the increased incidence of bone fractures precedes the ALS diagnosis by as much as 10 years (1, 22). In ALS SOD1G93A mice, mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in cortical bone osteocytes due to accumulation of mutant SOD1G93A protein (23). To determine if mitochondrial dysfunction continues despite absence of skeletal muscle atrophy, mutant SOD1G93A protein was overexpressed in the osteocytic cell line MLO-Y4 cells. In addition to increased mitochondrial dysfunction, MLO-Y4 cells overexpressing SOD1G93A protein showed increased apoptosis. Osteocyte apoptosis is associated with increased RANKL, which promotes osteoclastic bone resorption and subsequent bone loss and microarchitectural deterioration (24). These studies suggest that in addition to reduced mechanical loading on bone due to skeletal muscle atrophy, altered bone cell homeostasis mutation may contribute to skeletal fragility and increased skeletal fracture risk in ALS patients. Limitations of current studies include a lack of functional assessment of bone in male ALS mice. Fracture risk may differ in male versus female ALS patients, as studies in similarly-aged healthy cohorts show that women have up to a 4-fold higher fracture incidence than men (25). Also, to determine the underlying cause of increased fracture incidence prior to ALS diagnosis, future studies should examine bone functional assessments at earlier time points in the ALS SOD1G93A mice. Finally, since SOD1G93A mutation is only presented in a small fraction of ALS patients, other mouse models with different genetic mutations (C9orf72, TDP-43, FUS, VCP) that also lead to ALS should be examined to determine if bone functional properties are also similarly altered in these models (26). In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate that in addition to impairment of skeletal muscle function, ALS SOD1G93A mice exhibit skeletal fragility, as indicated by reduced femoral bending properties and fracture toughness compared to control mice. These results have important implications. As new treatments are introduced that extend the survival of ALS patients, targeted therapies to prevent skeletal fractures should also be considered, including drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, and drugs that promote bone formation, such as teriparatide or abaloparatide. Ultimately, fracture prevention may be proven to be an important aspect of sustaining quality of life among longer-surviving ALS patients.Acknowledgements: We thank Dimitrios Psaltos for assistance during microCT scanning and analysis.

However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.

Microgravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.1–3 For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30% after 3 weeks in microgravity,4 and femoral bone strength declines by ~2% for every 100 days in space.5,6 But the most important consequences lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth and are subjected to standard gravity; indeed, the dramatic decrease in muscle size, strength, and endurance7 produces long-term consequences including chronic muscle fatigue and persistent low back pain.8,9 While considerable information has been gathered concerning the physiological adaptations of the human body to weightlessness,10,11 long-term studies are rare and longitudinal assessments remain limited due to the difficulty to obtain muscle biopsy data on astronauts in-flight. For this reason, researchers have relied on several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading (HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has been established as the standard approach12,13 for ground-based research. However, this model puts considerable stress on the rat tail, which can lead to blood flow restriction, inflammation, and necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable to investigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encountered when astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38% of Earth gravity, or 0.38×g) and the Moon (16% of Earth gravity, or 0.16×g), or when they are exposed to artificial gravity induced by continuous centrifugation.14 An innovative partial weight-bearing (PWB) model, incorporating a tail-suspension and body harness, has been developed in mice, allowing normal activity for up to 3 weeks at several different levels of PWB.15,16 However, rats are generally considered a better animal model for spaceflight studies since their physiological processes, including drug metabolism, are considered more analogous to those of humans.17 Accordingly, we recently modified this mouse PWB model for rats18 by substituting a pelvic harness for the tail suspension, thereby providing a less stressful experience with improved reliability. In the present study, we sought to extend our initial18 work for up to 4 weeks and assessed the functional muscle alterations that occur in three different PWB levels (70%, 40%, and 20% of normal loading). Additionally, we harvested muscle tissues on days 7, 14, and 28 to obtain a comprehensive timeline of muscle atrophy at these different levels of PWB. By doing so, we can provide a detailed picture of the muscle alterations induced by a reduction of the mechanical load. This longitudinal study provides the first step for better understanding the impact of space missions in which stays on the Moon and Mars are planned.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals Wistar male rats, n = 149, (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing a mean ± standard error of 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± range of 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided ad libitum and monitored daily. Rats were regularly assessed for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyric staining around the eyes, poor grooming, and hair loss), harness and jacket fitting, ability to walk and move across the cage, food and water intake. Additionally, fully loaded and partially loaded mass measurements were recorded daily. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all experiments requiring anesthesia, vaporized isoflurane (1.5–3.5%) + oxygen was used and body temperature was maintained using a water-blanket (Gaymar, Inc., Orchard Park, NY) set at 37 °C (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and hind limb muscles were harvested and weighed on a precision analytical balance (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). PWB suspension model Animals were placed in four different groups: normal loading (PWB100, n = 38), 70% of normal loading (PWB70, n = 36), 40% of normal loading (PWB40, n = 36), and 20% of normal loading (PWB20, n = 39). In each group, 12 animals were euthanized on day 7 and day 14 for ex vivo tissue analysis. On day 28, 12–15 animals per group were euthanized. At the beginning of the study, rats were distributed to ensure a balanced distribution of the body weights across all groups. Forty-eight hours prior to day 0 (baseline) assessment, rats were placed in custom cages and jackets for acclimation. Beginning on day 0, and after obtaining the pre-suspension measurements, animals were subjected to either normal loading (PWB100) or other PWB levels using the model designed in our previous work.18 Briefly, rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a 2-point suspension allowing them to maintain quadrupedal behavior while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their initial body weight. Animals were weighed daily and if necessary the PWB apparatus was adjusted to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant within a 5% margin error of their desired PWB level, by modulating the chain length of the suspension device. Rats were positioned over a digital animal scale (ZIEIS, Lakeville, MN, USA) and their mass at PWB100, including the mass of the suspension device, was recorded. Then, the “unloaded” mass was obtained and the recorded level of PWB was calculated every morning by using the ratio of these two measurements. Calf circumference Under isoflurane anesthesia, animals were placed in a prone position with the left hind limb positioned at a 45° angle to the spine. The left leg was shaved using a hair clipper (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA, USA), and three measurements of the calf circumference were obtained at the tibial mid-shaft using a suture thread at baseline and after 7, 14, and 28 days of suspension. Each thread was then measured with a micrometer (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) and the average of the three measurements was recorded. Rear paw grip force Rats rear paws were placed on a 50 N capacity digital grip force meter (Chatillon, Largo, FL, USA) and gently pulled backward until the animal released its grip. The peak force generated was measured by a force transducer linked to the bar. Three tests were performed with a short rest period of at least 30 s between each trial, and averaged. Results were expressed as the percentage of each animal’s grip force measured at baseline (i.e., pre-suspension). Foot plate plantar force generation Under anesthesia, rats were placed on a force plate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada), and their left foot was securely taped on the foot plate. Monopolar electrodes (28 G, Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were used to deliver a tetanic, supramaxial stimulation of the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa at a frequency of 200 Hz, for 200 ms. The maximal torque response was recorded and the AUC was calculated. Muscle histomorphometry After euthanasia, the left gastrocnemius, soleus, and quadriceps femoris muscles were harvested and the wet mass of each muscle was determined using a precision analytical balance. The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were then placed in 10% buffered formalin and fixed for 48 h (histological analysis was not performed on quadriceps femoris). Samples were embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned into 10 micron slices and double immunofluorescence staining was performed using anti-collagen VI antibody (ab6588, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-slow skeletal myosin heavy chain antibody (ab11083, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Stained slides were subsequently imaged at 20× using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 epifluorescence microscope and fiber area was measured using the muscle morphometry plug-in (Anthony Sinadinos using Eclipse IDE) and FIJI (FIJI, ImageJ, ) with examiners blinded to PWB level and duration. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with Graphpad Prism 7.2 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) using one-way ANOVA for terminal measurements, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or the linear test for trend. Longitudinal data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Results are presented as mean ± SEM and considered significant when p < 0.05.

    "results": "Results The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a). Indeed, all unloaded groups displayed minimal differences between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further demonstrated by low coefficients of variation (PWB70: 0.54%, PWB40: 1.20%, PWB20: 0.95%). Actual body mass without the harness was recorded weekly (Fig. 1b), and at all time-points, PWB animals displayed a significantly different body mass change compared to the normal loading (PWB100) controls. Despite exhibiting a transient and significant loss of body mass in the first 14 days, all groups reached a body mass significantly above their baseline but lower than the PWB100 control rats after 28 days of suspension. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Tolerability and stability of the PWB model over time. Daily achieved partial weight-bearing (a) and weekly change in body mass (b) of all the animals involved in the study for up to four weeks (n = 11–12 per group). Results are presented as mean ± SEM and Tukey’s post hoc tests following two-way ANOVA are represented as ***: p < 0.001, ****: p < 0.0001 Calf circumference (Fig. 2) steadily increased over time in the control (PWB100) group, while it decreased significantly during the first 2 weeks in all PWB groups compared to their baseline (Fig. 2a). After 28 days of suspension, all animals displayed a calf circumference greater than their baseline, but control group values remained significantly higher than all other values. From 1-week onward, all PWB groups displayed a significantly lower grip force compared both to the controls (PWB100) and their respective baseline values (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2.

Weekly change in calf circumference (a) and rear paw grip force (b) of all animals (n = 11–12 per group). 4-weeks change in the area under curve (AUC) obtained during the tetanic plantar flexion (c, n = 3–6 per group). Results are presented as mean ± SEM and Tukey’s post hoc tests following one-way ANOVA (c) or two-way ANOVA (a, b) are represented as *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, and ****: p < 0.0001 vs PWB100 Nerve-stimulated plantar flexion force was measured only on days 0 and 28 (Fig. 2c). The control animals (PWB100) showed an increase in their area under curve (AUC) after 4 weeks (+5.1 mN s), which was significantly greater than in all the other PWB groups. Each unloaded group displayed a reduction of the AUC in a dose-dependent manner after 28 days of suspension, ranging from −2.7 mN s for the PWB70 groups and −5.9 mN s for the PWB40 group, to −6.7 mN.s for the PWB20 animals. This dose-dependent decrease over a 1-month period was assessed by performing a linear regression among the groups (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the maximal impulse recorded at 28 days of suspension can be normalized by the combined wet mass of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (triceps surae) in order to determine muscle quality (Supplementary Table 1). This parameter highlighted the linear correlation (p = 0.043 using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend) between the different groups, ranging from 9.87 ± 1.64 mN s g−1 for the control group to 6.14 ± 1.25 mN s g−1 for the rats exposed to PWB20, suggesting a reduction in the intrinsic force generating capability of the muscle due to PWB. At each time point (i.e., 7, 14, and 28 days) hind limb muscles were dissected and wet mass was recorded (Fig. 3). After 7 days, the PWB20 group showed a significant reduction in soleus mass compared to controls (−14.89 ± 2.87%, p < 0.05); PWB70 and PWB40 animals displayed substantial but non-significant reductions (−10.24 ± 3.20% and −8.54 ± 3.35%, respectively, Fig. 3a). After 14 days, all unloaded groups had a significantly lower soleus mass as compared to the PWB100 controls in a dose-dependent fashion. This finding remained observable at 28 days for the PWB20 and PWB40 groups but not for the PWB70 group despite a mean reduction of −9.53 ± 2.96% (p = 0.11, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Muscle wet mass after 7, 14, and 28 days of PWB. Wet mass of several hind limb muscles after exposure to PWB, including soleus (a, n = 12–15 per group), gastrocnemius (b, n = 12–15 per group) and quadriceps femoris (c, n = 9–15 per group). Results are presented as mean ± SEM and Tukey’s post hoc tests following ANOVAs are represented as *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001 and ****: p < 0.0001 vs PWB100 In contrast, the mass of the gastrocnemius muscle did not differ significantly for any PWB group as compared to PWB100 control animals for the first 2 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 3b). However, after 28 days of partial unloading, the animals exposed to PWB40 displayed significant muscle atrophy compared to the PWB100 controls (−11.14 ± 2.41%, p = 0.013, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test), as did the animals exposed to PWB20 (−9.00 ± 4.27%, p < 0.05). On day 7, quadriceps femoris wet mass (Fig. 3c) was significantly reduced only in the PWB20 group compared to the controls (−10.69 ± 1.66%, p < 0.05, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). On days 14 and 28, all experimental groups displayed significant quadriceps atrophy compared to the controls at PWB100 in a clear dose-dependent fashion. Using quantitative histomorphometry, we measured the average cross-sectional area (CSA) of the myofibers in both soleus (Fig. 4a) and gastrocnemius (Fig. 4b) muscles, which have been extensively studied for their adaptation to microgravity. In both muscles and under all reduced PWB conditions and time points, i.e., 7 days (Fig. 4c), 14 days (Fig. 4d), and 28 days (Fig. 4e), the unloaded groups displayed a significantly smaller myofiber CSA than the PWB100 controls. Moreover, myofiber atrophy followed a significant linear trend across groups plotted against their degree of PWB (R2 values for the soleus are: 0.79, 0.89, and 0.83 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. R2 values for the gastrocnemius are: 0.39, 0.97, and 0.99 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Histomorphometric analysis of the triceps surae.

Average cross-section area (CSA) of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles after 7 days (c), 14 days (d), and 28 days (e) of PWB at all levels. Scale bars are indicated in the bottom right corner of each picture and represent 50 µm. Each muscle was analyzed across groups using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend. Results are presented as mean ± SEM and post hoc tests for linear trend and R2 values of the fits are as follow. a Soleus p < 0.01, R2 = 0.79, Gastrocnemius p < 0.05, R2 = 0.39. b Soleus p < 0.01, R2 = 0.89, Gastrocnemius p < 0.01, R2 = 0.97. c Soleus p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.83, Gastrocnemius p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.99 (n = 11–12 per group) Additionally, we observed a fiber type switch in these two muscles of the unloaded rats compared to the PWB100 controls (Supplementary Table 2). While accounting for only approximately 40% of the soleus myofibers in mice,19 type 1 fibers (i.e., slow-twitch, oxidative) normally comprise from 80 to 94% of the myofibers in the soleus muscle in humans and in rats20,21 We observed a similar percentage of type 1 myofibers in the soleus muscle in our control PWB100 group, ranging from 90.96 ± 1.25% to 88.68 ± 1.81% between the different time points. In contrast, the number of type 1 fibers decreased (and presumably the number of type 2 fibers (i.e., fast-twitch, glycolytic) increased) in the soleus muscle with decreasing PWB level. For example, after 14 days of suspension, the percentage of type 1 fibers decreased in the soleus to 85.32 ± 2.65% for the rats at PWB70, 78.51 ± 2.07% at PWB40, and 84.08 ± 2.13% at PWB20. The opposite trend was observed in the gastrocnemius muscle, which is composed predominantly of type 2 fibers in normal conditions (PWB100) and displayed an increasingly higher percentage of type 1 fibers in the increasingly unloaded groups. The fiber-type switch that we observed has been reported previously in the literature,22,23 and has been described as a preferential atrophy according to muscle location and fiber-type. The extent of fiber-type switching increases with time (p = 0.0019, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test) and reduction in PWB level (p = 0.0484, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). However, although we visually observed a consistent trend in fiber-type switching in the gastrocnemius, we did not detect statistically significant differences between PWB groups in this muscle.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we demonstrate that our PWB model in rats shows excellent reliability and is effective in modeling the impact of reduced mechanical loading on muscle health, with several muscle parameters presenting dose-dependent alterations. The multiple time points allowed us to observe alterations in muscle function and mass as early as 7 days after exposure to reduced loading that appeared to become greater over time (Fig. 2b). The early muscle deficits that we observed here using our recently developed PWB model18,24 and are well described in the hindlimb unloading literature25–27 emphasize the need for mitigating strategies immediately after a reduction, even partial, in mechanical loading. Muscle impairment was further confirmed with the dose-dependent diminution in both the maximal torque obtained after a tetanic stimulation of the tibial nerve on day 28 (Fig. 2c), and the normalized tetanic impulse values at 28 days (Supplementary Table 1), therefore stressing the intrinsic loss of muscle function that correlated with reduced load. These physiological changes were also confirmed by the reduced hindlimb muscle mass (Fig. 3) and were associated with a reduction in myofiber cross sectional area (Fig. 4). These data are analogous to those previously observed after 21 days of PWB in mice.15,16 For example, when exposed to PWB20, soleus and gastrocnemius mass were reduced by 22% and 10%, respectively, compared to the control animals. Furthermore, similar to our findings, this previous work reported that the loss of muscle mass was dose-dependent and correlated to the PWB levels. As in prior human and animal studies, both in space or using ground-based analogues,4 we observed that the soleus muscle atrophied to a much greater extent than the gastrocnemius with a significant decrease in type 1 slow-twitch oxidative fibers (Supplementary Table 2). Based on this immunostaining, we assumed that this was correlated to an increase in the proportion of fast-twitch glycolytic myofibers; however, this assumption should be confirmed in future work by specifically staining for fast-twitch fibers, which we did not do. This effect on muscle composition has been extensively studied in the context of microgravity1,28,29 although the changes do not always reach statistical significance.30,31 However, the non-significant trend we observed in the gastrocnemius (i.e., a visible increase in slow-twitch fibers as seen in Fig. 4b), which is a mixed-fiber type muscle, has only been described in the context of neuromuscular disorders such as spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.32 In this disorder, the cellular shift often precedes symptoms including muscle atrophy, and is thought to be caused by a metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, in this pathology, early changes in gene expression seem to be responsible for the alteration of the glycolysis process, which in return, is contributing to the myofiber type shift by modifying skeletal muscle metabolism and substrate availability. Analogously, prediabetic and metabolic symptoms such as insulin resistance are often experienced by astronauts during their missions.33,34 Thus, it would be interesting to further investigate the metabolic changes that are induced in our model, including skeletal muscle insulin-resistance, mitochondrial respiration and overall energy homeostasis, to determine if these mechanisms, which are known to impact the muscle tissue, contribute to the shift in myofiber type or are a consequence of it. Our future studies based on RNA sequencing, and aiming at unraveling the modulation of gene expression during PWB, will need to assess these additional parameters to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Our PWB model offers the possibility of assessing the time-course of the musculoskeletal alterations across the spectrum of mechanical loading to better understand the underlying mechanisms of muscle loss and performance deficits. Muscle force, and therefore function, is a critical aspect of the astronaut health since it is essential for the efficient performance of a wide range of tasks. While reductions in force production may cause only minor issues during periods of microgravity, such deconditioning could represent a major impairment after landing, when astronauts are suddenly re-exposed to gravity. Interestingly, our results highlight that even a 30% decrease in mechanical loading (i.e., PWB70) induces substantial reductions in muscle force and size that do not recover after a month of suspension (Fig. 2c). The effects of partial gravity, as would be experienced by astronauts visiting Mars or the Moon or via centrifugation-induced artificial gravity, are far less studied than the effects of complete weightlessness due to the prior lack of established animal and human models. The ground-based PWB model we developed will allow for further investigation of the potential health impacts of partial mechanical unloading and could represent the first step toward finding solutions to protect astronauts during long-duration space missions. While successful, there remain several limitations to this model. First, we observed an initial transient decline in body mass; and although within an acceptable range (i.e., <10% of the initial body mass), as it is experienced in all ground-based models as well as in astronauts themselves,35–38 this body mass loss can create some bias in non-invasive assessments such as limb girth. Second, unlike humans, rats display constant growth, which also involves the musculoskeletal system. Indeed, the increase in muscle wet mass and in the average myofiber cross-sectional area was visible in our cohort of fully-loaded (PWB100) controls between different time-points. However, it has been described that after the initial and rapid growth period, male rats grow at a constant rate between 10 and 30 weeks old before showing signs of aging,39 thus confirming our choice in using 14–18-week-old animals. Another limitation of this work is that we did not attempt to quantify nocturnal or daytime behavior. However, in order to get some sense of their overall behavior, video monitoring was installed within the animal facility and qualitative differences in behavior among groups were not observed. Despite being quadrupedal animals, rats briefly but regularly display some bipedal behavior, mainly occurring during environmental exploration and feeding, and such bipedal behavior was visible in all groups. While not noticeably greater in the reduced PWB groups, these brief bipedal occurrences represent a change in the animals’ unloading status that was not preventable. Moreover, due to their quadrupedal locomotion, many factors diverge between humans and rats, and this model cannot account for all such differences. Additionally, we also did not obtain a continuous measure of ground reaction forces. This should certainly be considered for future work. Finally, we have not fully characterized the stress levels in our animals. While our behavioral assessments, including food intake, grooming, and physical assessments were helpful and are widely used to identify whether animals are under stress, it will be necessary to sample blood and/or feces at different time points to assess the level of corticosterone for an accurate measurement of the animals’ stress. This model has a number of potential uses beyond simply providing a ground-based analogue for different levels of partial unloading. First, it can serve as a testing ground for studies of therapeutic agents or exercise countermeasures in partial unloading.40 This is especially true since, if needed, it is extremely easy to remove the animals from the PWB harness for short periods of time to administer medications by injection or perform other assessments. Similarly, for exercise countermeasures, the model allows for relatively normal positioning and thus it would be possible, for example, to outfit a cage with a treadmill apparatus, allowing animals to perform in normal or reduced loading conditions. Likewise, by incorporating other hazardous events that occur during space flight, such as radiation exposure, the model could also address the impact of the combined effects of PWB and radiation exposure to muscle health.41,42 Moreover, the model could be used as a tool to assess the impact of sequentially altering loading levels. For example, a fully hind-limb suspended rat could then be placed in PWB40, so as to mimic an astronaut traveling from Earth to Mars and then landing on Mars, assessing the effect of partial unloading on an already compromised musculoskeletal system.24 Alternatively, the model could be used to assess the impact of the gradual mechanical reloading, via the progressive reintroduction of increased PWB, as means of re-acclimating safely to full Earth gravity after an extended period in space. In summary, we developed a PWB for rats capable of simulating various mechanical loading environments while maintaining a quadrupedal stance. This model, first developed to investigate the impact of reduced weight-bearing environments observed at extra-terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars, additionally brings valuable insights about the potential mitigating effects of applying artificial gravity during spaceflight to preserve muscle health.",

Copyright notice ID: 6706399 PMID: 31453318 Abstract In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration. Subject terms: Experimental models of disease, PhysiologyIntroduction By providing a sustained mechanical load, gravity is crucial for the maintenance and health of the musculoskeletal system. Microgravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.1–3 For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30% after 3 weeks in microgravity,4 and femoral bone strength declines by ~2% for every 100 days in space.5,6 But the most important consequences lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth and are subjected to standard gravity; indeed, the dramatic decrease in muscle size, strength, and endurance7 produces long-term consequences including chronic muscle fatigue and persistent low back pain.8,9 While considerable information has been gathered concerning the physiological adaptations of the human body to weightlessness,10,11 long-term studies are rare and longitudinal assessments remain limited due to the difficulty to obtain muscle biopsy data on astronauts in-flight. For this reason, researchers have relied on several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading (HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has been established as the standard approach12,13 for ground-based research. However, this model puts considerable stress on the rat tail, which can lead to blood flow restriction, inflammation, and necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable to investigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encountered when astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38% of Earth gravity, or 0.38×g) and the Moon (16% of Earth gravity, or 0.16×g), or when they are exposed to artificial gravity induced by continuous centrifugation.14 An innovative partial weight-bearing (PWB) model, incorporating a tail-suspension and body harness, has been developed in mice, allowing normal activity for up to 3 weeks at several different levels of PWB.15,16 However, rats are generally considered a better animal model for spaceflight studies since their physiological processes, including drug metabolism, are considered more analogous to those of humans.17 Accordingly, we recently modified this mouse PWB model for rats18 by substituting a pelvic harness for the tail suspension, thereby providing a less stressful experience with improved reliability. In the present study, we sought to extend our initial18 work for up to 4 weeks and assessed the functional muscle alterations that occur in three different PWB levels (70%, 40%, and 20% of normal loading). Additionally, we harvested muscle tissues on days 7, 14, and 28 to obtain a comprehensive timeline of muscle atrophy at these different levels of PWB. By doing so, we can provide a detailed picture of the muscle alterations induced by a reduction of the mechanical load. This longitudinal study provides the first step for better understanding the impact of space missions in which stays on the Moon and Mars are planned.Results The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a). Indeed, all unloaded groups displayed minimal differences between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further demonstrated by low coefficients of variation (PWB70: 0.54%, PWB40: 1.20%, PWB20: 0.95%). Actual body mass without the harness was recorded weekly (Fig. 1b), and at all time-points, PWB animals displayed a significantly different body mass change compared to the normal loading (PWB100) controls. Despite exhibiting a transient and significant loss of body mass in the first 14 days, all groups reached a body mass significantly above their baseline but lower than the PWB100 control rats after 28 days of suspension.

After 28 days of suspension, all animals displayed a calf circumference greater than their baseline, but control group values remained significantly higher than all other values. From 1-week onward, all PWB groups displayed a significantly lower grip force compared both to the controls (PWB100) and their respective baseline values (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2.

Weekly change in calf circumference (a) and rear paw grip force (b) of all animals (n = 11–12 per group). 4-weeks change in the area under curve (AUC) obtained during the tetanic plantar flexion (c, n = 3–6 per group). Results are presented as mean ± SEM and Tukey’s post hoc tests following one-way ANOVA (c) or two-way ANOVA (a, b) are represented as *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001, and ****: p < 0.0001 vs PWB100Nerve-stimulated plantar flexion force was measured only on days 0 and 28 (Fig. 2c). The control animals (PWB100) showed an increase in their area under curve (AUC) after 4 weeks (+5.1 mN s), which was significantly greater than in all the other PWB groups. Each unloaded group displayed a reduction of the AUC in a dose-dependent manner after 28 days of suspension, ranging from −2.7 mN s for the PWB70 groups and −5.9 mN s for the PWB40 group, to −6.7 mN.s for the PWB20 animals. This dose-dependent decrease over a 1-month period was assessed by performing a linear regression among the groups (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the maximal impulse recorded at 28 days of suspension can be normalized by the combined wet mass of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (triceps surae) in order to determine muscle quality (Supplementary Table 1). This parameter highlighted the linear correlation (p = 0.043 using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend) between the different groups, ranging from 9.87 ± 1.64 mN s g−1 for the control group to 6.14 ± 1.25 mN s g−1 for the rats exposed to PWB20, suggesting a reduction in the intrinsic force generating capability of the muscle due to PWB. At each time point (i.e., 7, 14, and 28 days) hind limb muscles were dissected and wet mass was recorded (Fig. 3). After 7 days, the PWB20 group showed a significant reduction in soleus mass compared to controls (−14.89 ± 2.87%, p < 0.05); PWB70 and PWB40 animals displayed substantial but non-significant reductions (−10.24 ± 3.20% and −8.54 ± 3.35%, respectively, Fig. 3a). After 14 days, all unloaded groups had a significantly lower soleus mass as compared to the PWB100 controls in a dose-dependent fashion. This finding remained observable at 28 days for the PWB20 and PWB40 groups but not for the PWB70 group despite a mean reduction of −9.53 ± 2.96% (p = 0.11, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Muscle wet mass after 7, 14, and 28 days of PWB. Wet mass of several hind limb muscles after exposure to PWB, including soleus (a, n = 12–15 per group), gastrocnemius (b, n = 12–15 per group) and quadriceps femoris (c, n = 9–15 per group). Results are presented as mean ± SEM and Tukey’s post hoc tests following ANOVAs are represented as *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001 and ****: p < 0.0001 vs PWB100In contrast, the mass of the gastrocnemius muscle did not differ significantly for any PWB group as compared to PWB100 control animals for the first 2 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 3b). However, after 28 days of partial unloading, the animals exposed to PWB40 displayed significant muscle atrophy compared to the PWB100 controls (−11.14 ± 2.41%, p = 0.013, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test), as did the animals exposed to PWB20 (−9.00 ± 4.27%, p < 0.05). On day 7, quadriceps femoris wet mass (Fig. 3c) was significantly reduced only in the PWB20 group compared to the controls (−10.69 ± 1.66%, p < 0.05, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). On days 14 and 28, all experimental groups displayed significant quadriceps atrophy compared to the controls at PWB100 in a clear dose-dependent fashion. Using quantitative histomorphometry, we measured the average cross-sectional area (CSA) of the myofibers in both soleus (Fig. 4a) and gastrocnemius (Fig. 4b) muscles, which have been extensively studied for their adaptation to microgravity. In both muscles and under all reduced PWB conditions and time points, i.e., 7 days (Fig. 4c), 14 days (Fig. 4d), and 28 days (Fig. 4e), the unloaded groups displayed a significantly smaller myofiber CSA than the PWB100 controls. Moreover, myofiber atrophy followed a significant linear trend across groups plotted against their degree of PWB (R2 values for the soleus are: 0.79, 0.89, and 0.83 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. R2 values for the gastrocnemius are: 0.39, 0.97, and 0.99 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Histomorphometric analysis of the triceps surae.

Average cross-section area (CSA) of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles after 7 days (c), 14 days (d), and 28 days (e) of PWB at all levels. Scale bars are indicated in the bottom right corner of each picture and represent 50 µm. Each muscle was analyzed across groups using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend. Results are presented as mean ± SEM and post hoc tests for linear trend and R2 values of the fits are as follow. a Soleus p < 0.01, R2 = 0.79, Gastrocnemius p < 0.05, R2 = 0.39. b Soleus p < 0.01, R2 = 0.89, Gastrocnemius p < 0.01, R2 = 0.97. c Soleus p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.83, Gastrocnemius p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.99 (n = 11–12 per group)Additionally, we observed a fiber type switch in these two muscles of the unloaded rats compared to the PWB100 controls (Supplementary Table 2). While accounting for only approximately 40% of the soleus myofibers in mice,19 type 1 fibers (i.e., slow-twitch, oxidative) normally comprise from 80 to 94% of the myofibers in the soleus muscle in humans and in rats20,21 We observed a similar percentage of type 1 myofibers in the soleus muscle in our control PWB100 group, ranging from 90.96 ± 1.25% to 88.68 ± 1.81% between the different time points. In contrast, the number of type 1 fibers decreased (and presumably the number of type 2 fibers (i.e., fast-twitch, glycolytic) increased) in the soleus muscle with decreasing PWB level. For example, after 14 days of suspension, the percentage of type 1 fibers decreased in the soleus to 85.32 ± 2.65% for the rats at PWB70, 78.51 ± 2.07% at PWB40, and 84.08 ± 2.13% at PWB20. The opposite trend was observed in the gastrocnemius muscle, which is composed predominantly of type 2 fibers in normal conditions (PWB100) and displayed an increasingly higher percentage of type 1 fibers in the increasingly unloaded groups. The fiber-type switch that we observed has been reported previously in the literature,22,23 and has been described as a preferential atrophy according to muscle location and fiber-type. The extent of fiber-type switching increases with time (p = 0.0019, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test) and reduction in PWB level (p = 0.0484, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). However, although we visually observed a consistent trend in fiber-type switching in the gastrocnemius, we did not detect statistically significant differences between PWB groups in this muscle.Discussion In this study, we demonstrate that our PWB model in rats shows excellent reliability and is effective in modeling the impact of reduced mechanical loading on muscle health, with several muscle parameters presenting dose-dependent alterations. The multiple time points allowed us to observe alterations in muscle function and mass as early as 7 days after exposure to reduced loading that appeared to become greater over time (Fig. 2b). The early muscle deficits that we observed here using our recently developed PWB model18,24 and are well described in the hindlimb unloading literature25–27 emphasize the need for mitigating strategies immediately after a reduction, even partial, in mechanical loading. Muscle impairment was further confirmed with the dose-dependent diminution in both the maximal torque obtained after a tetanic stimulation of the tibial nerve on day 28 (Fig. 2c), and the normalized tetanic impulse values at 28 days (Supplementary Table 1), therefore stressing the intrinsic loss of muscle function that correlated with reduced load. These physiological changes were also confirmed by the reduced hindlimb muscle mass (Fig. 3) and were associated with a reduction in myofiber cross sectional area (Fig. 4). These data are analogous to those previously observed after 21 days of PWB in mice.15,16 For example, when exposed to PWB20, soleus and gastrocnemius mass were reduced by 22% and 10%, respectively, compared to the control animals. Furthermore, similar to our findings, this previous work reported that the loss of muscle mass was dose-dependent and correlated to the PWB levels. As in prior human and animal studies, both in space or using ground-based analogues,4 we observed that the soleus muscle atrophied to a much greater extent than the gastrocnemius with a significant decrease in type 1 slow-twitch oxidative fibers (Supplementary Table 2). Based on this immunostaining, we assumed that this was correlated to an increase in the proportion of fast-twitch glycolytic myofibers; however, this assumption should be confirmed in future work by specifically staining for fast-twitch fibers, which we did not do. This effect on muscle composition has been extensively studied in the context of microgravity1,28,29 although the changes do not always reach statistical significance.30,31 However, the non-significant trend we observed in the gastrocnemius (i.e., a visible increase in slow-twitch fibers as seen in Fig. 4b), which is a mixed-fiber type muscle, has only been described in the context of neuromuscular disorders such as spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.32 In this disorder, the cellular shift often precedes symptoms including muscle atrophy, and is thought to be caused by a metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, in this pathology, early changes in gene expression seem to be responsible for the alteration of the glycolysis process, which in return, is contributing to the myofiber type shift by modifying skeletal muscle metabolism and substrate availability. Analogously, prediabetic and metabolic symptoms such as insulin resistance are often experienced by astronauts during their missions.33,34 Thus, it would be interesting to further investigate the metabolic changes that are induced in our model, including skeletal muscle insulin-resistance, mitochondrial respiration and overall energy homeostasis, to determine if these mechanisms, which are known to impact the muscle tissue, contribute to the shift in myofiber type or are a consequence of it. Our future studies based on RNA sequencing, and aiming at unraveling the modulation of gene expression during PWB, will need to assess these additional parameters to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Our PWB model offers the possibility of assessing the time-course of the musculoskeletal alterations across the spectrum of mechanical loading to better understand the underlying mechanisms of muscle loss and performance deficits. Muscle force, and therefore function, is a critical aspect of the astronaut health since it is essential for the efficient performance of a wide range of tasks. While reductions in force production may cause only minor issues during periods of microgravity, such deconditioning could represent a major impairment after landing, when astronauts are suddenly re-exposed to gravity. Interestingly, our results highlight that even a 30% decrease in mechanical loading (i.e., PWB70) induces substantial reductions in muscle force and size that do not recover after a month of suspension (Fig. 2c). The effects of partial gravity, as would be experienced by astronauts visiting Mars or the Moon or via centrifugation-induced artificial gravity, are far less studied than the effects of complete weightlessness due to the prior lack of established animal and human models. The ground-based PWB model we developed will allow for further investigation of the potential health impacts of partial mechanical unloading and could represent the first step toward finding solutions to protect astronauts during long-duration space missions. While successful, there remain several limitations to this model. First, we observed an initial transient decline in body mass; and although within an acceptable range (i.e., <10% of the initial body mass), as it is experienced in all ground-based models as well as in astronauts themselves,35–38 this body mass loss can create some bias in non-invasive assessments such as limb girth. Second, unlike humans, rats display constant growth, which also involves the musculoskeletal system. Indeed, the increase in muscle wet mass and in the average myofiber cross-sectional area was visible in our cohort of fully-loaded (PWB100) controls between different time-points. However, it has been described that after the initial and rapid growth period, male rats grow at a constant rate between 10 and 30 weeks old before showing signs of aging,39 thus confirming our choice in using 14–18-week-old animals. Another limitation of this work is that we did not attempt to quantify nocturnal or daytime behavior. However, in order to get some sense of their overall behavior, video monitoring was installed within the animal facility and qualitative differences in behavior among groups were not observed. Despite being quadrupedal animals, rats briefly but regularly display some bipedal behavior, mainly occurring during environmental exploration and feeding, and such bipedal behavior was visible in all groups. While not noticeably greater in the reduced PWB groups, these brief bipedal occurrences represent a change in the animals’ unloading status that was not preventable. Moreover, due to their quadrupedal locomotion, many factors diverge between humans and rats, and this model cannot account for all such differences. Additionally, we also did not obtain a continuous measure of ground reaction forces. This should certainly be considered for future work. Finally, we have not fully characterized the stress levels in our animals. While our behavioral assessments, including food intake, grooming, and physical assessments were helpful and are widely used to identify whether animals are under stress, it will be necessary to sample blood and/or feces at different time points to assess the level of corticosterone for an accurate measurement of the animals’ stress. This model has a number of potential uses beyond simply providing a ground-based analogue for different levels of partial unloading. First, it can serve as a testing ground for studies of therapeutic agents or exercise countermeasures in partial unloading.40 This is especially true since, if needed, it is extremely easy to remove the animals from the PWB harness for short periods of time to administer medications by injection or perform other assessments. Similarly, for exercise countermeasures, the model allows for relatively normal positioning and thus it would be possible, for example, to outfit a cage with a treadmill apparatus, allowing animals to perform in normal or reduced loading conditions. Likewise, by incorporating other hazardous events that occur during space flight, such as radiation exposure, the model could also address the impact of the combined effects of PWB and radiation exposure to muscle health.41,42 Moreover, the model could be used as a tool to assess the impact of sequentially altering loading levels. For example, a fully hind-limb suspended rat could then be placed in PWB40, so as to mimic an astronaut traveling from Earth to Mars and then landing on Mars, assessing the effect of partial unloading on an already compromised musculoskeletal system.24 Alternatively, the model could be used to assess the impact of the gradual mechanical reloading, via the progressive reintroduction of increased PWB, as means of re-acclimating safely to full Earth gravity after an extended period in space. In summary, we developed a PWB for rats capable of simulating various mechanical loading environments while maintaining a quadrupedal stance. This model, first developed to investigate the impact of reduced weight-bearing environments observed at extra-terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars, additionally brings valuable insights about the potential mitigating effects of applying artificial gravity during spaceflight to preserve muscle health.Methods Animals Wistar male rats, n = 149, (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing a mean ± standard error of 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± range of 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided ad libitum and monitored daily. Rats were regularly assessed for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyric staining around the eyes, poor grooming, and hair loss), harness and jacket fitting, ability to walk and move across the cage, food and water intake. Additionally, fully loaded and partially loaded mass measurements were recorded daily. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all experiments requiring anesthesia, vaporized isoflurane (1.5–3.5%) + oxygen was used and body temperature was maintained using a water-blanket (Gaymar, Inc., Orchard Park, NY) set at 37 °C (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and hind limb muscles were harvested and weighed on a precision analytical balance (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).PWB suspension model Animals were placed in four different groups: normal loading (PWB100, n = 38), 70% of normal loading (PWB70, n = 36), 40% of normal loading (PWB40, n = 36), and 20% of normal loading (PWB20, n = 39). In each group, 12 animals were euthanized on day 7 and day 14 for ex vivo tissue analysis. On day 28, 12–15 animals per group were euthanized. At the beginning of the study, rats were distributed to ensure a balanced distribution of the body weights across all groups. Forty-eight hours prior to day 0 (baseline) assessment, rats were placed in custom cages and jackets for acclimation. Beginning on day 0, and after obtaining the pre-suspension measurements, animals were subjected to either normal loading (PWB100) or other PWB levels using the model designed in our previous work.18 Briefly, rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a 2-point suspension allowing them to maintain quadrupedal behavior while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their initial body weight. Animals were weighed daily and if necessary the PWB apparatus was adjusted to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant within a 5% margin error of their desired PWB level, by modulating the chain length of the suspension device. Rats were positioned over a digital animal scale (ZIEIS, Lakeville, MN, USA) and their mass at PWB100, including the mass of the suspension device, was recorded. Then, the “unloaded” mass was obtained and the recorded level of PWB was calculated every morning by using the ratio of these two measurements.Calf circumference Under isoflurane anesthesia, animals were placed in a prone position with the left hind limb positioned at a 45° angle to the spine. The left leg was shaved using a hair clipper (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA, USA), and three measurements of the calf circumference were obtained at the tibial mid-shaft using a suture thread at baseline and after 7, 14, and 28 days of suspension. Each thread was then measured with a micrometer (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) and the average of the three measurements was recorded.Rear paw grip force Rats rear paws were placed on a 50 N capacity digital grip force meter (Chatillon, Largo, FL, USA) and gently pulled backward until the animal released its grip. The peak force generated was measured by a force transducer linked to the bar. Three tests were performed with a short rest period of at least 30 s between each trial, and averaged. Results were expressed as the percentage of each animal’s grip force measured at baseline (i.e., pre-suspension).Foot plate plantar force generation Under anesthesia, rats were placed on a force plate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada), and their left foot was securely taped on the foot plate. Monopolar electrodes (28 G, Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were used to deliver a tetanic, supramaxial stimulation of the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa at a frequency of 200 Hz, for 200 ms. The maximal torque response was recorded and the AUC was calculated.Muscle histomorphometry After euthanasia, the left gastrocnemius, soleus, and quadriceps femoris muscles were harvested and the wet mass of each muscle was determined using a precision analytical balance. The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were then placed in 10% buffered formalin and fixed for 48 h (histological analysis was not performed on quadriceps femoris). Samples were embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned into 10 micron slices and double immunofluorescence staining was performed using anti-collagen VI antibody (ab6588, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-slow skeletal myosin heavy chain antibody (ab11083, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Stained slides were subsequently imaged at 20× using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 epifluorescence microscope and fiber area was measured using the muscle morphometry plug-in (Anthony Sinadinos using Eclipse IDE) and FIJI (FIJI, ImageJ, ) with examiners blinded to PWB level and duration.Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with Graphpad Prism 7.2 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) using one-way ANOVA for terminal measurements, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or the linear test for trend. Longitudinal data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Results are presented as mean ± SEM and considered significant when p < 0.05.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary tables.
