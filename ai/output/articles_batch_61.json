Copyright notice ID: 11403809 PMID: 39283686 Abstract NASA’s space life sciences research programs established a decades-long legacy of enhancing our ability to safely explore the cosmos. From Skylab and the Space Shuttle Program to the NASA Balloon Program and the International Space Station National Lab, these programs generated priceless data that continue to paint a vibrant picture of life in space. These data are available to the scientific community in various data repositories, including the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and NASA GeneLab. Here we recognize the 30-year anniversary of data access through ALSDA and the 10-year anniversary of GeneLab. Keywords: space biology, NASA, data, open science, data archive, FAIR, omicsBackground Space travel involves inherent hazards, including altered gravity, increased exposure to radiation, confinement, and distance from Earth [1]. Characterizing and mitigating these risks is the focus of the Thriving in Deep Space (TIDES) initiative, part of NASA’s Space Biology Program within the Biological and Physical Sciences Division. NASA’s upcoming Moon to Mars Missions will face increased health hazards [2]. TIDES aims to meet these challenges by investigating biological responses to the space environment and utilizing this knowledge to enhance biotechnological systems essential for human health and performance beyond low Earth orbit. Open and FAIR [3] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data are paramount for supporting these efforts by enabling scientific collaboration and gaining new knowledge. This view of data stewardship in the modern era is embraced by NASA and its Science Mission Directorate (SMD), which launched the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative and released Science Policy Directive SPD-41a [4]. Data collection and archiving has been a key principle at NASA for decades. Here we recognize the 30-year anniversary in 2024 of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), a database of experiment descriptions, payloads, missions, telemetry, results, and bioimaging data mostly from NASA-funded life sciences investigations. Similarly, 2024 marks the 10-year anniversary of NASA GeneLab, the omics repository for space biology and space-relevant experiments. In 2021, ALSDA and GeneLab merged to form the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), unifying these precious data resources under 1 platform [5].History and 30-Year Anniversary of the NASA ALSDA The work to create the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) began in 1990 by teams at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Ames Research Center (ARC), and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). It was established and fully funded in FY94 with archive centers at ARC, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), JSC, and GSFC. ARC focused on nonhuman data, JSC on human data, KSC on plant data, and GSFC provided Master Catalog functions. In 1995, LSDA was tasked with providing representation for Space Life Sciences to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and International Standards Organization (ISO) efforts to develop a reference model for the emerging challenge of archiving digital data. For 10 years, ALSDA led the Space Life Sciences effort for this ambitious endeavor. The resulting CCSDS/ISO product “The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model” is the most widely adopted archival standards framework [6]. The repository was designed around experiments with relational links to personnel, hardware, payloads, missions, and so on. ALSDA was charged with collecting all ARC-funded life sciences experimental data and metadata to allow scientists to perform retrospective analyses across missions, experiments, disciplines, and research subjects/species. ALSDA began capturing hardware information, audio/visual media, images, slides, mission and payload information, experiment descriptions, raw experimental data, and raw telemetry downlink and ground control data in both analog and digital formats. Years later, ALSDA was tasked with creating and managing the biospecimen storage facility, capturing, cataloging, and disseminating biospecimens remaining from flight and ground experiments. Faced with growing demands for open-access and high-quality data, ALSDA was unable to upgrade systems until it merged with the modern GeneLab data system [7] in 2021. As a result, this integration now maximizes science-return on all legacy and future data collections. In 2024, ALSDA remains responsible for curating, archiving, and making available space-relevant phenotypic, physiological, bioimaging, behavioral, and environmental telemetry datasets. Collection of scientific reports and publications was streamlined to other program-level repositories such as Taskbook and PubSpace.History and 10-Year Anniversary of NASA GeneLab The early 2000s saw a paradigm shift in biological research, wherein costs of high-throughput sequencing dropped precipitously and large omics datasets were generated at an increasing rate. “Omics” refers to a group of biological disciplines that study comprehensive datasets of related molecules in an organism, such as genomics (DNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and transcriptomics (RNA), to understand complex biological systems and processes. In 2011, the National Academies’ Decadal Survey in Life and Physical Sciences Research emphasized the importance of omics, advocating for informatics technologies and a multilevel, systems biology approach for space biology research [8]. In keeping with the 2011 Decadal Survey recommendations, NASA initiated the GeneLab project in 2014. From the 2014 GeneLab Strategic Plan, the goal was to allow maximally open and unrestricted access to omics data generated from biological experiments in space, as well as associated experimental metadata. A critical first step for GeneLab was to establish meticulous normalization standards to provide “rich metadata” using the ISA (Investigation, Study, Assay) model framework for data curation, thereby enhancing the FAIRness of these data [3]. In 2018, GeneLab established the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), composed of data repository users and scientists. Together, they defined optimal analytical workflows for data, resulting in consensus bioinformatics pipelines to process and standardize all raw omics data, significantly enhancing dataset reusability by eliminating the need for downloading terabytes of raw sequencing data or having specialized bioinformatics expertise. Building on this foundation of standardized metadata and processed data, GeneLab recently released a visualization portal enabling users to effectively visualize experimental processed omics data. Over the past decade, GeneLab has evolved into a sophisticated data system with a single point of entry for scientists to upload their data, expedite the curation of new datasets, search the database, download raw and processed data via a web browser or API, and visualize data using state-of-the-art tools. GeneLab is also fostering a vibrant scientific community through its AWGs, which regularly conduct meta-analyses, make new discoveries, and enhance the repository. These groups have been producing independent publications for many years through the reuse of data, culminating in the release of 2 major space biology paper collections [1, 9]. Additionally, GeneLab now serves as the omics repository for the European Space Agency’s SciSpacE research program, integrating European data through NASA’s portals.The Open Science Data Repository: Best of Both Worlds The integration of ALSDA with GeneLab [5] has resulted in the creation of OSDR, which is built on GeneLab’s robust framework and incorporates data and metadata from both databases. This integration has improved data accessibility and reusability through new tools and workflows, enabling the merging of multimodal and multihierarchical data from spaceflight experiments for enhanced knowledge discovery and mission support. The consolidation has standardized and made data from ALSDA searchable and maximally openly accessible, while also enhancing GeneLab’s omics data by linking it transparently with non-omics data from the same experiments. Including over 20 years of ALSDA’s legacy data, along with valuable payload, mission, and hardware records, OSDR now hosts over 500 studies across all life forms, from microbes to animals, plants, and humans, each with curated metadata and accessible raw and processed data files. Additionally, the repository contains over 300 records related to payloads, missions, and hardware. The AWG ecosystem has rapidly expanded, gaining over 300 new members in the past year and fostering the creation of new groups that contribute valuable insights to OSDR. Notably, subject matter experts from the ALSDA AWG have helped establish minimum data requirements and metadata standards for over 60 assay types on OSDR, many of which previously lacked standards. Additionally, the new artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning AWG has been instrumental in enhancing the readiness of OSDR data for machine learning and AI applications. This group also played a key role in summarizing a NASA workshop focused on the use of AI to enable self-driving laboratories, automated science, and precision space health in future space missions [10].Conclusions A paradigm shift has occurred in modern space biosciences, where reliable data reuse is now essential, as well as science being interdisciplinary, inclusive, and maximally transparent. To enable large communities of scientists on Earth to participate in spaceflight discovery, NASA plays a leading role in this shift through a strong open science program.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

    "results": "Results Increased relative humidity conditions lead to increased microbial growth Dust was received from four vacuum bags from the ISS with an average initial fungal concentration of 4.39 × 106 spore equivalents (SE)/mg dust and an average bacterial load of 1.06 × 107 cells/mg dust. After incubating the dust samples for 2 weeks at different ERH conditions to simulate an unexpected high moisture event, the fungal concentration ranged from 4.22 × 106 SE/mg dust at 50% ERH to 2.10 × 1010 SE/mg dust at 100% ERH (Fig. 1, Table S2). Increased fungal concentration was associated with elevated ERH conditions after 2 weeks (Spearman rank correlation (rs) = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with significantly more fungal growth at 80% (P < 0.044) and 85–100% ERH (P < 0.0001) (Table S3). Bacterial concentration was significantly increased compared to the original load at 90% (P = 0.005) and 100% ERH (P = 0.0001) with a positive association between bacterial concentration and ERH (rs = 0.39, P = 0.0001) (Additional file 2: Figure S1A, Table S2–S3). Dust was also collected by tweezers from the ISS HEPA filters and returned frozen for analysis with lower fungal and bacterial loads compared to bulk dust samples (Additional file 1: Table S4). These results are similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [8, 24] and bacteria [8] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [24] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109 spore equivalents per milligram of dust when exposed to 100% ERH for 2 weeks. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Fungal growth concentrations of original dust and after constant equilibrium relative humidity incubations at 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 100% ERH at 25℃. Each fungal concentration represents the average value of four vacuum bags which included physical triplicates for each bag and triplicate qPCR concentrations for each sample for a total of 36 measurements per condition. Error bars represent the standard error of fungal quantities for each vacuum bag. * indicate statistically significant growth (P < 0.05) compared to the original dust using Satterthwaite two-sample t testOriginal dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) and dust incubated at 50% ERH for 2 weeks showed no visible signs of microbial growth, in scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 2A,B). At elevated relative humidity conditions of 85% and 100% ERH, we observed indications of active fungal growth on the dust substrate (Fig. 2C,D). This included elongated hyphae with conidia production prevalent on almost all dust surfaces, which indicates that fungal reproduction is occurring. In general, more of all of these structures were observed at 100% compared to 85% ERH, similar to other studies with Earth dust and carpet samples [24]. Our previous microscopy analyses in residential carpets also concluded that almost no fungal growth occurred even at high ERH conditions if house dust was not present, indicating the nutrients in dust are essential for active growth [24]. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ISS dust from the original dust (A) and incubations at 50% ERH (B) show fibrous dust materials, but no fungal growth. Fungal growth including spores, elongated hyphae, and different fungal propagules was observed in ISS dust incubated at 85% ERH (C) and 100% ERH (D) for 2 weeks at 25℃Total soluble organic carbon was measured in ISS dust samples that included the original dust as well as dust incubated at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks at 25℃ (Fig. 3). For each condition, a total of four samples were measured that included one sample per ISS bag collected. In the original dust, total soluble organic carbon ranged from 12.55 to 36.79 mg/L with no significant changes after a 2-week incubation at 85% ERH (10.2–29.05 mg/L, P = 0.52). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in soluble organic carbon after 2-week incubations at 100% ERH (1.76–8.08 mg/L, P= 0.048). This is a soluble organic carbon utilization rate of approximately 1.2 and 0.3 mg soluble carbon per day for 100% and 85% ERH conditions, respectively. From the original ISS dust samples, we measured an average of 22 mg soluble organic carbon per milligram of dust. In comparison, house dust from Earth-based residential homes contains 35 mg of total soluble organic carbon per mg of dust [8]. This indicates that dust from both the ISS and homes on Earth contains significantly more carbon than is required for fungal growth (~ 0.0072 mg soluble carbon/mg dust). Therefore, moisture continues to be the limiting factor for growth. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Total soluble organic carbon (TOC) measured in ISS dust in the original dust as well as in dust incubated (25°C) for 2 weeks at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions. Significant reductions in TOC were observed for 100% conditions but not 85% compared to original dust samples indicating potential fungal use of TOC in ISS dust. Each condition contained four samples (one from each ISS bag in this study), and error bars are the standard deviation of these four bags. * represents a statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in total soluble organic carbon compared to original dust samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t test Fungal growth predictions vary based on maximum ERH Relative humidity often fluctuates in indoor spaces, so we applied the time-of-wetness framework to model fungal growth measured under varying ERH conditions (high moisture for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day). We observed an activation-limited growth model for elevated (85% ERH) conditions, while at saturated (100% ERH), we observed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). At both elevated and saturated conditions, growth was associated with increasing time per day at higher moisture levels (rs = 0.68, P = 0.015). Bacterial growth showed no significant difference between elevated and saturated conditions and did not align with any time-of-wetness growth model (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). On Earth, fungi in house dust samples differed and showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for both elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions, and bacteria also had insufficient growth to apply a model [25]. Effective growth constants and total fungal growth rates for the model are available in Additional file 1: Tables S5–S9. The differences in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS-built environments may be due to different microbial and chemical compositions of the dust because even Earth-based buildings in close proximity can differ. These differences can be attributed to many environmental factors such as the occupants inside, cleaning habits, building materials, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Fungal time-of-wetness modeling for elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Elevated conditions (orange) show an activation-limited growth model, while saturated conditions (green) show a deactivation-limited growth model. Error bars shown represent the standard error between all four ISS bags sampled Microbial diversity changes as ERH conditions are altered We analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in the samples via DNA amplicon sequencing (Table S10). There was a total of 11,180,519 quality fungal reads and 2,502,228 quality bacterial reads present in all sequenced samples. A total of 107 fungal species and 127 bacterial species were present in at least 10% of samples. The most common fungal genera were Aspergillus (100% of samples), Penicilium (95%), and Rhodotorula (94%). The most common fungal species in all samples included Aspergillus sydowii (100%), Aspergillus unguis (100%), and Penicillium chrysogenum (90%). For bacteria, Bacillales (99%), Actinomycetales (99%), and Clostridiales (96%) were the most common order and the most common bacterial species were Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (81%), Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (78%), and Lactobacillus helveticus (74%). After incubation at constant ERH, fungal community composition differed by each bag (R2 = 0.233, P = 0.001) and ERH condition (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5A). In all varying ERH samples, fungal community composition also differed by bag (R2 = 0.098, P = 0.001) and varying ERH conditions (R2 = 0.090, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5B), though to a lesser degree compared to the constant ERH incubation. These differences were more pronounced when limiting the analysis to a single maximum ERH level or time elevated. For example, considering the 24-h incubations only for elevated and saturated conditions shows a more distinct difference in species (R2 = 0.201, P = 0.001). PCoA plots for all conditions is shown in Additional file 2: Figures S2–S4 and Additional file 1: Table S11). Bacterial beta diversity analyses showed similar trends of community composition changing with increased ERH and time-of-wetness conditions (Additional file 2: Figure S5, Additional file 1: Table S12). Finally, frozen dust samples were compared to the original dust and constant ERH incubation samples at 50, 85, and 100% ERH. For both fungi and bacteria, frozen samples clustered close to the original dust and 50% ERH samples but were more dissimilar to 85 and 100% ERH samples (Additional file 1: Figure S6, Additional file 1: Table S13). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) of beta diversity fungal species present in ISS dust after 2-week incubations at varying ERH conditions (A) and time-of-wetness conditions (B). Both scenarios show as ERH increases (green to red) the fungal species composition is alteredMoisture also impacted sample diversity. For fungal constant ERH incubations, richness was significantly decreased (Q < 0.05) compared to original dust samples starting at 85% ERH, while Shannon diversity differences appeared at 80% ERH (Fig. 6A, B, Additional file 1: Table S14). For time-of-wetness samples at saturated (100% ERH) conditions, there were significant changes in both fungal richness and Shannon diversity at extended times elevated (12, 18, and 24 h) compared to the shorter times tested (0 and 6 h) (Fig. 6C,D). We also limited analyses to specific ERH conditions and times elevated (Additional file 1: Table S15). Bacterial samples also showed significant changes in richness and Shannon diversity during constant ERH incubations at 85%, 90%, and 100% ERH compared to original dust samples, while time-of-wetness samples also showed significant differences between 50 and 100% ERH conditions for 24 h (Additional file 1: Figure S7A, Additional file 1: Table S16). Finally, frozen samples were compared to original dust samples as well as samples from constant ERH incubations at 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH. For bacteria, there was a significant difference in both richness and Shannon diversity for all conditions tested; however, fungi only showed these differences at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks compared to the frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S7B, Additional file 1: Table S17). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots for constant ERH, 2-week incubations (A, B), and time of wetness incubations (C, D). For constant incubations, the x-axis represents the original dust and ERH conditions after 2 weeks of incubation (A, B). Time-of-wetness incubations show the time elevated on the x-axis as well as the ERH conditions tested (50% = red, 85% = green, and 100% = blue). Note that 50% of ERH conditions for time-of-wetness samples were only performed at a time elevated of one (24 h per day)Differential abundance analyses were used to compare fungal species between all incubation conditions in this study. Comparing fungal species at non-elevated (original dust, 50, 60, 70% ERH) to elevated (80, 85, 90, 100% ERH) conditions identified a total of 77 species more abundant at non-elevated conditions compared to only six species more abundant at elevated conditions (Additional file 1: Table S18). This indicates that at elevated ERH conditions (> 80% ERH) fungi such as Aspergillus sydowii (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus unguis (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus nidulans (P < 0.0001), Aspergiullus subversicolor (P < 0.0001), Penicillium chrysogenum (P = 0.0016), and Aspegillus hongkongensis (P = 0.0071) may be growing, significantly reducing fungal diversity in the ISS dust. Under varying relative humidity conditions, there were generally more species associated with lower moisture conditions (Additional file 1: Tables S19–S21). These analyses were also performed for bacteria and found no significant differences in bacterial species between any of the incubation times and ERH conditions tested (Additional file 1: Table S23). Aspergillus is the dominant genus, and it becomes more dominant as ERH and time elevated increases (Fig. 7). A similar trend is also shown in the constant ERH incubations (Additional file 1: Figure S8), where Aspergillus is the most dominant at 85% and 90% ERH. Interestingly, at 100%, Penicillium starts to grow significantly more compared to other elevated ERH conditions (80%, 85%, and 90% ERH). Finally, we compared original dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) to frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S9). For relative abundance, the original dust samples contained more Aspergillus, Cyberlinda, and Alternaria, while the frozen samples appeared to contain more Rhodotorula, Malassezia, and Rhodosporidiobolus. There was also a significant difference in absolute abundance for all fungal genera with up to 104 spore eq/mg dust present in the original dust samples compared to the frozen samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Mean relative (A) and absolute (B) abundance data for the fungal genus of time-of-wetness samples. Abundances represent elevated (85%) and saturated (100%) relative humidity conditions at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h time-of-wetness samples as well as unmodified (50%) at 24 h. The mean abundances here represent the average for day 5, 10, 14, and 21 dust samples for each relative humidity and time-of-wetness condition for the four total ISS vacuum bags tested in this study (a total of 12 samples for each ERH/time-of-wetness condition)",
    "discussion": "Discussion To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [28]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5 h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [58] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [59, 60]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. In ISS dust after 2 weeks exposed to constant ERH conditions significant growth for fungi occurred at 80% RH, while for bacteria this occurred at 90% ERH compared to original dust samples (no ERH exposure). This is similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [5, 8] and bacteria [5] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [8] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109SE per milligram dust when exposed to 100% RH for 2 weeks. The time-of-wetness framework has also been applied to growth in Earth-based house dust samples that can be compared to samples from ISS dust. Time-of-wetness samples showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for fungi for both elevated (85% RH) and saturated (100% RH) conditions [9]. These results differ in contrast to the ISS dust where elevated RH fungi showed an activation-limited growth model and at saturated conditions showed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). There may be several potential reasons for this difference in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS built environments. Generally, every indoor environment has a different microbial dust composition. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. These results offer a path to improved prediction of fungal growth in specialized indoor spaces modeled on fluctuating ERH conditions. However, it is important to restate that these incubations were performed on Earth and not in environmental conditions experienced in low-Earth orbit such as microgravity, elevated CO2, and low-dose radiation, all of which may affect microbial growth and microbial composition. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered. Given the difficulty of procuring spaceflight samples, we have a relatively small sample size (dust from four ISS vacuum bags), but this should be sufficient to provide valuable information. These limitations highlight the need for future on-orbit studies to better understand this microbiology during actual spaceflight conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].",

Copyright notice ID: 11386075 PMID: 39256883 Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

This will be fueled in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination initiative that will support private companies such as Starlab Space, LLC, and Blue Origin to build and operate the next generation of space stations [1]. In addition, NASA’s Artemis missions will establish a lunar orbiting space station named Gateway, as well as a surface habitat, which will be the proving ground for technologies needed to live on Mars [2]. One of the best analogs we have available to these future systems is the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a unique built environment that is an almost completely closed indoor system continuously inhabited for over 20 years in low-Earth orbit. The ISS contains its own unique microbiome with over 12,000 species identified onboard [3], similar to indoor environments on Earth [4]. These microbes originate from the astronauts, their food, onboard experiments, and other sources [5, 6]. Similar to Earth, many microbes reside in the dust [7]. On Earth, indoor dust acts as a sink [8] for microbes and a potential exposure source [9] for occupants in the indoor environment. Dust is also generated onboard the ISS from the daily activities of the crew. The crew must use a vacuum to remove dust from the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter coverings, which are a part of the air ventilation system, on a weekly basis [10]. The exposure risk for microbes in dust is not well understood in microgravity environments, but it differs from Earth due to the altered particle size distributions in the air and the absence of gravitational settling influences how they deposit in the lungs when inhaled [11–13]. Exposure to fungal growth indoors is associated with negative health outcomes such as asthma and allergies [14, 15]. Understanding indoor microbial exposure risks is especially critical in the extreme conditions experienced during spaceflight that compromise the human immune system, potentially exacerbating any negative health effects [16]. Additionally, the unique stressors of a spaceflight environment can cause changes in microbial communities such as increased virulence [17] and antimicrobial resistance [5]. Negative health impacts due to microbial exposure have impacted ISS crew members during flight with symptoms such as rhinitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes [18]. In addition to astronaut health, preventing microbial growth during spaceflight is important to maintain the structural integrity of the spacecraft as some microbes are able to degrade mission-critical spacecraft materials such as plastics [19], sealants [20], and fibers [21] which can cause premature failure of spacecraft components. Microbial activity onboard has been known to cause issues in essential systems such as biofouling in water lines due to issues in the original design that has since been rectified [22]. In addition, capture of bacterial- and fungal-related airborne particles is a major function of the ISS air filtration system [23]. Increased levels of relative humidity facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially for fungi. Elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) in the air is sufficient to provide enough water availability to microbes to support growth in the dust [8, 24, 25], which can be predicted even under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework [26]. These elevated ERH conditions significantly alter community composition and change microbial function in terrestrial house dust [24, 25, 27]. On the ISS, the current NASA operational guidelines for relative humidity is to maintain it between 25 and 75% [28], but pockets of elevated moisture conditions are possible during the daily operations onboard. Examples include fungal growth on plant experiments onboard due to a ventilation failure that caused high ERH [29], fungal growth on fabric panels where a wet towel was placed [30] on various pieces of equipment used onboard [31], and microbial growth on free-floating condensate on the Russian station Mirin an unused section of the station [32]. However, we do not yet understand if we are able to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS as can be done on Earth. The goal of this project is to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS under varying moisture conditions using the time-of-wetness framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to actively grow a collection of microbes directly from a substrate that is onboard the ISS to model unexpected high moisture conditions. The results have important implications for protecting human health and spacecraft integrity during future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.Methodology Overview Dust samples were obtained from four vacuum bags that came from weekly housekeeping activities to clean the protective screen covers for the HEPA filters which are part of the ISS air ventilation system. Samples were returned to Earth, where they were incubated at varying constant ERH conditions (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100%) for 2 weeks. In addition, the time-of-wetness framework was used to model microbial growth at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for the quantification of bacteria and fungi for all samples. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to determine how microbial communities in the ISS dust changed for each ERH and time-of-wetness condition. In addition, a subset of these samples was observed via scanning electron microscopy to visualize microbial growth directly on the ISS dust samples.ISS dust samples All dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypo-allergenic filter system Oreck# PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard the ISS which the astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. It is important to note that we had no control over when, how much, or where these vacuums were used while onboard, which means other areas may have also been vacuumed in addition to the HEPA filter coverings. In total, ISS dust from four separate vacuum bags was returned to Earth and analyzed in this study. ISS vacuum bags 1–4 were collected by the ISS crew on GMT 264 (September 21, 2018), GMT 102 (April 12, 2019), GMT 243 (August 31, 2019), and GMT 286 (October 13, 2019) and returned to Earth on SpaceX16 (January 13, 2019), SpaceX-17 (July 3, 2019), and SpaceX-19 (January 7, 2020). In total, it took approximately 6, 5, 6, and 4 months for bags 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reach our lab at the Ohio State University from the actual collection date onboard ISS. For ISS vacuum bag 1, the full vacuum bag was sent directly to The Ohio State University Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. ISS vacuum bags 2–4 were first sent to the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry group at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA), and then, a subsample of dust was sent to us for analysis. In addition, we received dust samples that were frozen onboard the ISS, returned in cold stowage, and sent directly to our laboratory, where they were stored at − 80 °C until use (Additional file 1: Table S1).Incubations All incubation was completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25 °C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (aw) using an Aqualab™ Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA, USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50 mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset® HOBO® Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) to monitor ERH and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (three samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies [24]. Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined [25]. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day when relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold [26]. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (R/k), we first calculated the growth rates (k) for constant (24 h/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (R) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time of wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified on days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25-mg dust sample per day per bag). All incubation chambers were covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape.DNA extractions and qPCR DNA was extracted from all dust samples using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads) to allow for more efficient lysis of cells in the dust substrate [33]. Each DNA extraction run included a blank and was confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at − 20℃ until use. qPCR was used to determine fungal and bacterial concentrations for all samples with an Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 6 Flex System (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using QuantStudio Real-Time PCR Software version 1.3. All samples were diluted to a 50X solution in Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer solution, and triplicate qPCR measurements were made for each sample. For every plate run on qPCR, two wells of template controls were included, and all wells consisted of a 25-µL reaction volume, which included 2 µL of sample. Total fungal and bacterial quantities in samples were determined by the use of universal assays that measured at the whole kingdom level. SYBR® Green (Applied Biosystems™), forward primer (FF2) 5′-GGTTCTATTTTGTTGGTTTCTA-3′, and reverse primer (FR1) 5′-CTCTCAATCTGTCAATCCTTATT-3′ was used to quantify fungal concentration which targets the 18S rRNA gene [34]. Aspergillus fumigatus was grown on Difco™ Potato Dextrose Agar and after 14 days spores were collected, counted, and DNA extracted for use as standards for qPCR fungal quantification. For bacteria, TaqMan® master mix (Applied Biosystems™), forward primer 5′-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′, reverse prime 5′-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3′, and PROBE (6-FAM)-5′-CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′-(BHQ) was used to target the 16S rRNA gene [9, 34, 35]. Bacillus atrophaeus was grown in Difco™ Luria–Bertani Broth, Miller overnight, counted, and DNA extracted for qPCR bacterial quantification standards. Fungal and bacterial standards were counted using a Labomed microscope with a 20X air objective lens and InCyto DHC-N01-5 Neubauer Improved C-Chips. These standards were run in duplicate for each qPCR plate with a total of six dilutions ranging from 101 to 106 cells or spores/µL. For bacteria, this was reported as cells per milligram of dust, while fungi were reported as spore equivalents per milligram of dust. The term “spore equivalent” refers to the fact fungi are eukaryotic, and the DNA measured with qPCR could be from a spore or from another fungal structure present such as hyphae or different fungal propagules. qPCR cycling parameters for fungal and bacterial primer sets consisted of one cycle of 50℃ for 2 min and 95℃ for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 s and 60℃ for 1 min. All qPCR values were multiplied by a dilution factor (50X), and the 50 µL extraction volume was then divided by the dust mass of each sample. A subset of samples went through qPCR inhibition testing by spiking A. fumigatus and B. atrophaeus onto the dust with no inhibition of the reaction detected. The molecular methods used in this study, namely qPCR values are reported in cells/spore equivalents and will not account for differences in DNA extraction efficiency, amplification bias, or gene copy number between species [36, 37].Microbial sequencing All sequencing for dust samples was performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ at RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). All samples were sequenced for fungi, and a smaller subset was sequenced for bacteria. For fungal sequencing, ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) ribosomal DNA primers were used [38], while the bacteria used 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) primers [39] with 2 × 300 bp sequencing reads. The Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, bioinformatics pipeline was used to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data [40]. For fungi, primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt [41] plug-in and paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method [42]. Sequences were then trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with three low-quality base windows using the Quality-filter plugin [43]. Fungal sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with UNITE database reference sequences (version 9.0) [44]. Bacterial sequences were run through the Dada2 pipeline [45] and clustered by phylogeny [46]. Beta diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted UniFrac statistics with a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis function in QIIME2 [47]. Richness and Shannon alpha diversity metrics were calculated for all incubations and significance determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test statistic from QIIME2. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.0 [48], the User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2019 database [49], and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) [50] version 1.4 was used to identify fungal taxonomy. A note that an updated 2022 version of the UNITE database now exists, and we compared relative abundance data to our analyses of the 2019 database to which no significant differences for our samples were observed. Bacterial taxa were classified in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin [51] which utilized the Greengenes database version 13_8 [52]. All sequencing data has been submitted to NASA’s GeneLab database (GLDS-623) [53].Microscopy and total organic carbon A subset of dust samples from ISS bag 1 were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Approximately 1.25 mg of dust was placed on black double-sided carbon tape and attached to a SEM sample holder. These samples were then incubated in triplicates for several ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) for 2 weeks at 25 °C. After incubation, samples were coated with 25 nm of gold and placed in a Apreo™ LoVac Scanning Electron Microscope (Thermo Scientific™ Waltham, MA, USA) for visual observation. Microscopy preparation and analysis were completed at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (Ohio State University Columbus, OH, USA). In addition, we measured the total soluble organic carbon in the original dust and dust after incubation after 2 weeks at 85% and 100% ERH. A total of four samples were measured at each condition which included one from each bag. Each dust sample was placed into 35 mL of DI in a 50-mL falcon tube. The tubes were placed on a shaker table at 180 rpm for 30 min. After shaking, 30 mL of the solution was extracted and run through a 0.45-µm filter which was then used for analyses. Soluble organic carbon was measured on a Shimadzu TOC-V CSN (VELP Scientific, Inc. Deer Park, NY, USA).Statistical analyses Microbial quantities for constant ERH incubations at each ERH condition tested were compared to quantities in the original dust (no incubation) samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t tests and a Spearman rank correlation coefficient utilizing STATA (Version 16.1). Statistical significance was considered (P< 0.05). QIIME2 version 2021.8.0 was used to create a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot using Bray–Curtis and UniFrac distance matrices. The Adonis function was also used to compare ERH and TOW conditions for microbial species beta diversity while Kruskal–Wallis was used to determine significance for alpha diversity. The PCoA plot was imported into R Studio (version 2021.09.0 Build 351) for visualization. Statistical Analysis System® Studio, version 9.4, was used to compare taxonomic diversity between ERH conditions, time-of-wetness, frozen, and original dust samples. Species that did not occur in at least 10% of all samples were removed before analysis. All relative abundance data was transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function and combined with qPCR quantities to produce an absolute abundance value as previously described [25]. Taxonomy among samples was analyzed using the PROC MULTTEST FDR Test Mean function in SAS. False discovery rate was used instead of positive false discovery rate due to the relatively small sample size [54].Results Increased relative humidity conditions lead to increased microbial growth Dust was received from four vacuum bags from the ISS with an average initial fungal concentration of 4.39 × 106 spore equivalents (SE)/mg dust and an average bacterial load of 1.06 × 107 cells/mg dust. After incubating the dust samples for 2 weeks at different ERH conditions to simulate an unexpected high moisture event, the fungal concentration ranged from 4.22 × 106 SE/mg dust at 50% ERH to 2.10 × 1010 SE/mg dust at 100% ERH (Fig. 1, Table S2). Increased fungal concentration was associated with elevated ERH conditions after 2 weeks (Spearman rank correlation (rs) = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with significantly more fungal growth at 80% (P < 0.044) and 85–100% ERH (P < 0.0001) (Table S3). Bacterial concentration was significantly increased compared to the original load at 90% (P = 0.005) and 100% ERH (P = 0.0001) with a positive association between bacterial concentration and ERH (rs = 0.39, P = 0.0001) (Additional file 2: Figure S1A, Table S2–S3). Dust was also collected by tweezers from the ISS HEPA filters and returned frozen for analysis with lower fungal and bacterial loads compared to bulk dust samples (Additional file 1: Table S4). These results are similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [8, 24] and bacteria [8] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [24] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109 spore equivalents per milligram of dust when exposed to 100% ERH for 2 weeks. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Fungal growth concentrations of original dust and after constant equilibrium relative humidity incubations at 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 100% ERH at 25℃. Each fungal concentration represents the average value of four vacuum bags which included physical triplicates for each bag and triplicate qPCR concentrations for each sample for a total of 36 measurements per condition. Error bars represent the standard error of fungal quantities for each vacuum bag. * indicate statistically significant growth (P < 0.05) compared to the original dust using Satterthwaite two-sample t testOriginal dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) and dust incubated at 50% ERH for 2 weeks showed no visible signs of microbial growth, in scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 2A,B). At elevated relative humidity conditions of 85% and 100% ERH, we observed indications of active fungal growth on the dust substrate (Fig. 2C,D). This included elongated hyphae with conidia production prevalent on almost all dust surfaces, which indicates that fungal reproduction is occurring. In general, more of all of these structures were observed at 100% compared to 85% ERH, similar to other studies with Earth dust and carpet samples [24]. Our previous microscopy analyses in residential carpets also concluded that almost no fungal growth occurred even at high ERH conditions if house dust was not present, indicating the nutrients in dust are essential for active growth [24]. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ISS dust from the original dust (A) and incubations at 50% ERH (B) show fibrous dust materials, but no fungal growth. Fungal growth including spores, elongated hyphae, and different fungal propagules was observed in ISS dust incubated at 85% ERH (C) and 100% ERH (D) for 2 weeks at 25℃Total soluble organic carbon was measured in ISS dust samples that included the original dust as well as dust incubated at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks at 25℃ (Fig. 3). For each condition, a total of four samples were measured that included one sample per ISS bag collected. In the original dust, total soluble organic carbon ranged from 12.55 to 36.79 mg/L with no significant changes after a 2-week incubation at 85% ERH (10.2–29.05 mg/L, P = 0.52). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in soluble organic carbon after 2-week incubations at 100% ERH (1.76–8.08 mg/L, P= 0.048). This is a soluble organic carbon utilization rate of approximately 1.2 and 0.3 mg soluble carbon per day for 100% and 85% ERH conditions, respectively. From the original ISS dust samples, we measured an average of 22 mg soluble organic carbon per milligram of dust. In comparison, house dust from Earth-based residential homes contains 35 mg of total soluble organic carbon per mg of dust [8]. This indicates that dust from both the ISS and homes on Earth contains significantly more carbon than is required for fungal growth (~ 0.0072 mg soluble carbon/mg dust). Therefore, moisture continues to be the limiting factor for growth. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Total soluble organic carbon (TOC) measured in ISS dust in the original dust as well as in dust incubated (25°C) for 2 weeks at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions. Significant reductions in TOC were observed for 100% conditions but not 85% compared to original dust samples indicating potential fungal use of TOC in ISS dust. Each condition contained four samples (one from each ISS bag in this study), and error bars are the standard deviation of these four bags. * represents a statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in total soluble organic carbon compared to original dust samples using Satterthwaite two-sample t testFungal growth predictions vary based on maximum ERH Relative humidity often fluctuates in indoor spaces, so we applied the time-of-wetness framework to model fungal growth measured under varying ERH conditions (high moisture for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h per day). We observed an activation-limited growth model for elevated (85% ERH) conditions, while at saturated (100% ERH), we observed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). At both elevated and saturated conditions, growth was associated with increasing time per day at higher moisture levels (rs = 0.68, P = 0.015). Bacterial growth showed no significant difference between elevated and saturated conditions and did not align with any time-of-wetness growth model (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). On Earth, fungi in house dust samples differed and showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for both elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions, and bacteria also had insufficient growth to apply a model [25]. Effective growth constants and total fungal growth rates for the model are available in Additional file 1: Tables S5–S9. The differences in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS-built environments may be due to different microbial and chemical compositions of the dust because even Earth-based buildings in close proximity can differ. These differences can be attributed to many environmental factors such as the occupants inside, cleaning habits, building materials, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Fungal time-of-wetness modeling for elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Elevated conditions (orange) show an activation-limited growth model, while saturated conditions (green) show a deactivation-limited growth model. Error bars shown represent the standard error between all four ISS bags sampledMicrobial diversity changes as ERH conditions are altered We analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in the samples via DNA amplicon sequencing (Table S10). There was a total of 11,180,519 quality fungal reads and 2,502,228 quality bacterial reads present in all sequenced samples. A total of 107 fungal species and 127 bacterial species were present in at least 10% of samples. The most common fungal genera were Aspergillus (100% of samples), Penicilium (95%), and Rhodotorula (94%). The most common fungal species in all samples included Aspergillus sydowii (100%), Aspergillus unguis (100%), and Penicillium chrysogenum (90%). For bacteria, Bacillales (99%), Actinomycetales (99%), and Clostridiales (96%) were the most common order and the most common bacterial species were Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (81%), Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (78%), and Lactobacillus helveticus (74%). After incubation at constant ERH, fungal community composition differed by each bag (R2 = 0.233, P = 0.001) and ERH condition (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5A). In all varying ERH samples, fungal community composition also differed by bag (R2 = 0.098, P = 0.001) and varying ERH conditions (R2 = 0.090, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5B), though to a lesser degree compared to the constant ERH incubation. These differences were more pronounced when limiting the analysis to a single maximum ERH level or time elevated. For example, considering the 24-h incubations only for elevated and saturated conditions shows a more distinct difference in species (R2 = 0.201, P = 0.001). PCoA plots for all conditions is shown in Additional file 2: Figures S2–S4 and Additional file 1: Table S11). Bacterial beta diversity analyses showed similar trends of community composition changing with increased ERH and time-of-wetness conditions (Additional file 2: Figure S5, Additional file 1: Table S12). Finally, frozen dust samples were compared to the original dust and constant ERH incubation samples at 50, 85, and 100% ERH. For both fungi and bacteria, frozen samples clustered close to the original dust and 50% ERH samples but were more dissimilar to 85 and 100% ERH samples (Additional file 1: Figure S6, Additional file 1: Table S13). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) of beta diversity fungal species present in ISS dust after 2-week incubations at varying ERH conditions (A) and time-of-wetness conditions (B). Both scenarios show as ERH increases (green to red) the fungal species composition is alteredMoisture also impacted sample diversity. For fungal constant ERH incubations, richness was significantly decreased (Q < 0.05) compared to original dust samples starting at 85% ERH, while Shannon diversity differences appeared at 80% ERH (Fig. 6A, B, Additional file 1: Table S14). For time-of-wetness samples at saturated (100% ERH) conditions, there were significant changes in both fungal richness and Shannon diversity at extended times elevated (12, 18, and 24 h) compared to the shorter times tested (0 and 6 h) (Fig. 6C,D). We also limited analyses to specific ERH conditions and times elevated (Additional file 1: Table S15). Bacterial samples also showed significant changes in richness and Shannon diversity during constant ERH incubations at 85%, 90%, and 100% ERH compared to original dust samples, while time-of-wetness samples also showed significant differences between 50 and 100% ERH conditions for 24 h (Additional file 1: Figure S7A, Additional file 1: Table S16). Finally, frozen samples were compared to original dust samples as well as samples from constant ERH incubations at 50%, 85%, and 100% ERH. For bacteria, there was a significant difference in both richness and Shannon diversity for all conditions tested; however, fungi only showed these differences at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks compared to the frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S7B, Additional file 1: Table S17). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Fungal alpha diversity plots for constant ERH, 2-week incubations (A, B), and time of wetness incubations (C, D). For constant incubations, the x-axis represents the original dust and ERH conditions after 2 weeks of incubation (A, B). Time-of-wetness incubations show the time elevated on the x-axis as well as the ERH conditions tested (50% = red, 85% = green, and 100% = blue). Note that 50% of ERH conditions for time-of-wetness samples were only performed at a time elevated of one (24 h per day)Differential abundance analyses were used to compare fungal species between all incubation conditions in this study. Comparing fungal species at non-elevated (original dust, 50, 60, 70% ERH) to elevated (80, 85, 90, 100% ERH) conditions identified a total of 77 species more abundant at non-elevated conditions compared to only six species more abundant at elevated conditions (Additional file 1: Table S18). This indicates that at elevated ERH conditions (> 80% ERH) fungi such as Aspergillus sydowii (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus unguis (P < 0.0001), Aspergillus nidulans (P < 0.0001), Aspergiullus subversicolor (P < 0.0001), Penicillium chrysogenum (P = 0.0016), and Aspegillus hongkongensis (P = 0.0071) may be growing, significantly reducing fungal diversity in the ISS dust. Under varying relative humidity conditions, there were generally more species associated with lower moisture conditions (Additional file 1: Tables S19–S21). These analyses were also performed for bacteria and found no significant differences in bacterial species between any of the incubation times and ERH conditions tested (Additional file 1: Table S23). Aspergillus is the dominant genus, and it becomes more dominant as ERH and time elevated increases (Fig. 7). A similar trend is also shown in the constant ERH incubations (Additional file 1: Figure S8), where Aspergillus is the most dominant at 85% and 90% ERH. Interestingly, at 100%, Penicillium starts to grow significantly more compared to other elevated ERH conditions (80%, 85%, and 90% ERH). Finally, we compared original dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) to frozen dust samples (Additional file 1: Figure S9). For relative abundance, the original dust samples contained more Aspergillus, Cyberlinda, and Alternaria, while the frozen samples appeared to contain more Rhodotorula, Malassezia, and Rhodosporidiobolus. There was also a significant difference in absolute abundance for all fungal genera with up to 104 spore eq/mg dust present in the original dust samples compared to the frozen samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Mean relative (A) and absolute (B) abundance data for the fungal genus of time-of-wetness samples. Abundances represent elevated (85%) and saturated (100%) relative humidity conditions at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h time-of-wetness samples as well as unmodified (50%) at 24 h. The mean abundances here represent the average for day 5, 10, 14, and 21 dust samples for each relative humidity and time-of-wetness condition for the four total ISS vacuum bags tested in this study (a total of 12 samples for each ERH/time-of-wetness condition)Discussion To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [28]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5 h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [58] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [59, 60]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. In ISS dust after 2 weeks exposed to constant ERH conditions significant growth for fungi occurred at 80% RH, while for bacteria this occurred at 90% ERH compared to original dust samples (no ERH exposure). This is similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [5, 8] and bacteria [5] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [8] and ISS dust could both reach more than 109SE per milligram dust when exposed to 100% RH for 2 weeks. The time-of-wetness framework has also been applied to growth in Earth-based house dust samples that can be compared to samples from ISS dust. Time-of-wetness samples showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for fungi for both elevated (85% RH) and saturated (100% RH) conditions [9]. These results differ in contrast to the ISS dust where elevated RH fungi showed an activation-limited growth model and at saturated conditions showed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig. 4). There may be several potential reasons for this difference in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS built environments. Generally, every indoor environment has a different microbial dust composition. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. These results offer a path to improved prediction of fungal growth in specialized indoor spaces modeled on fluctuating ERH conditions. However, it is important to restate that these incubations were performed on Earth and not in environmental conditions experienced in low-Earth orbit such as microgravity, elevated CO2, and low-dose radiation, all of which may affect microbial growth and microbial composition. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered. Given the difficulty of procuring spaceflight samples, we have a relatively small sample size (dust from four ISS vacuum bags), but this should be sufficient to provide valuable information. These limitations highlight the need for future on-orbit studies to better understand this microbiology during actual spaceflight conditions.Conclusion Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].Supplementary Information 40168_2024_1864_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (1.7MB, pdf) Additional file 1: Table S1: Frozen dust sample dates and location.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms: Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, Microbiota",
    "introduction": "Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10 and mesenchymal stem11 cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15 characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38 identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39 explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the genera Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus. In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight. Fig. 1. Experimental design.

    "methods": "Methods Experimental design Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR, were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions (replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/light cycle maintained. After 29 days of flight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18) and sacrificed alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacrificed after 53–56 days of flight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1 Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1 South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive - ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of spaceflight, so were not significantly different (t-test, p > 0.05) between flight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (±0.35) °C, 41.49 (±2.28) % and 3219 (±340) CO2 ppm, respectively. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on October 24, 2017, by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab record (OSD-249), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using isoflurane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine during the dissection period, which occurred 53–56 days post-launch. Blood samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture, though these were not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination followed by thoracotomy. The ISS spaceflight mice carcasses underwent hind limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped in aluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at −80 °C or colder until return. The ISS Ground Control followed the same euthanasia methods and preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental endpoints included the collection of blood samples, completion of hind limb dissection, and collection of faecal samples. Faecal samples were extruded from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for further analysis. DNA extraction Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n = 9 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 7 mice from GC_LAR, n = 7 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is available in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249. 16S rRNA gene amplification DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol149,150. In the first stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) containing Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage and incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell, employing paired-end 2 × 153 base reads. Whole metagenome sequencing Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and five cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragment sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center). RNA extraction and sequencing Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 8 mice from GC_LAR, n = 9 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 9 mice from GC_LAR, n = 10 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were ~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed. Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab records OSD-247 (colon) or OSD-245 (liver). 16S rRNA gene barcoding Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor28,35,139,151,152. Exact sequence variants (ESV) were identified in place of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur155 and a count threshold parameter of 96. Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the  16 S curated and  nr/nt databases (January 2022 versions). Differentially abundant ESVs were manually assessed for quality. When the highest identity/coverage was shared amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained and reported. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was applied159. Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161 and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARAMETERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --paired --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163 was used to remove potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164 with the following parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165 was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166 expectation maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assignment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168 was used with the option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169 was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a first alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the  nr/nt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from  refseq informed by first iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity > 97%, total alignment length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to WMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases ( nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL, InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as input in the GhostKOALA webserver170 to add functional genes and pathways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999). Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was performed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classification was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classification of metagenome assembled genomes173. Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled following NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174. Alpha and beta diversity To estimate and compare microbial richness within samples, alpha diversity was measured using diversity indices using Phyloseq R library175 and was compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination) was performed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with normalised counts (Supplementary Data 1) while constrained ordination was based on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA). Significance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library176 was used to conduct these analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. As an exploratory visualisation of annotated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalised counts of differentially abundant species (30 in each comparison) were selected as input and umap function from the umap R package (v 0.2.10) was used for each comparison with default parameters. Care should be taken when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS microbiome profiling lacks absolute quantification and is vulnerable to biases from PCR amplification and/or sequencing depth. Differential abundance/expression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be at least ≥ 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2159 based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/contigs/ORFs/transcripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical significance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inflated abundance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros and flagged as significantly differentially abundant. To address conservative p-value distribution179 of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180 R library. Functional enrichment analysis Ghostkoala output was organised into a gene count table using WMS ORF raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) of WMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs (FDR <0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data 4). p-values were calculated using a hypergeometric test using clusterProfiler (v4.7.1.003) R library181. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182 platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining significance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184 R annotation library.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight increased total body weight Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two spaceflight groups flown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR, returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceflight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days of spaceflight. Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and 56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceflight are commonly observed40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of spaceflight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9) and significantly increased after 56 days of spaceflight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ significantly (t-test, p > 0.05) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4), respectively, but did significantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1 (±1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n = 9) mice to 32.9 g−1 (±1.0) in FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al.42 observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes to substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy adipose cells play an important role in maintaining insulin sensitivity, dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-inflammatory and insulin-antagonistic molecules43,44. Spaceflight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceflight phenotypes45 which are influenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceflight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS mice (after 56 days of spaceflight). Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after quality control, with an average of 77,015 ± 853 per sample (Fig. 2A–E; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722 (91.32%) of reads. Thirty-five ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of > 99.9% nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised taxa (<99% nucleotide identity; 14 of which were flagged as putative chimeras). Most counts (73.1%) were captured by ESVs annotated as putative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 to multiple species which share identical rRNA gene sequences at the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identified across all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteobacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Deferribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1). Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53.7% of sequence counts. Fig. 2.

Extended details in Supplementary data 1–3.WMS of faecal DNA generated 277,294,078 reads after quality control, with an average of 8,665,440 ± 1,423,541 per sample (Fig. 2F–I; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Data 2). Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw counts after filtering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3) occurrence filtering to allow statistical detection of spaceflight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally annotated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation and filtering for high confidence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length) identified 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and 1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. goldstienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa, representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity49,50. Microbial alpha diversity indices did not significantly differ between mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the first axes explained 25.46% and 17.63% of variation using 16 S rRNA gene amplification and 19.41% and 11.49% of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permutation tests confirmed significant variation between groups under constraint for both amplicon and WMS data (Fig. 2E, I; p <0.05; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3), suggesting spaceflight influenced gut microbiota in both comparisons regardless of the metagenomic approach taken. Significant spaceflight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and pathogenicity Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identified 45 ESVs that were significantly different in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR and 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value = 0.004, av padj = 0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, Data 1). Although there were divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica, the common significant enrichment of E. muris and D. welbionis in mice after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight, compared to separate matched control groups, suggests spaceflight had some common influence of gut microbiota which persisted over the 29–56 days onboard the ISS as well as some distinct effects over time.

Extended details in Supplementary Data 1–3. Amplicon sequencing: Species enriched in FLT_LAR mice compared to controls included Coprobacillus cateniformis, Dysosmobacter welbionis, Enterocloster aldenensis, Extibacter muris and Hungatella xylanolytica, while depleted species included Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and ESVs ambiguous to multiple Enterocloster species (including E.lavalensis) and Ligilactobacillus species (including L.murinus). Species enriched in FLT_ISS mice included D.welbionis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Enterocloster clostridioformis, E.muris, Guopingia tenuis, Romboutsia ilealis and Romboutsia timonensis, while depleted species included H.xylanolytica. WMS: Microbiome species significantly enriched in after 29 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including Blautia pseudococcoides, Clostridioides difficile, C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris, G.tenuis, Hungatella hathewayi, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila and the proteobacteria Delftia lacustris. Significantly depleted species included 20 firmicutes, including Acutalibacter muris, Anaerostipes caccae, Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium scindens, Enterococcus faecalis, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Enterocloster bolteae, E.lavalensis, Flavonifractor plautii, I.butyriciproducens, Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus xylosus, and the Proteobacteria Providencia rettgeri. These findings agreed with significant differential abundance of C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris and I.butyriciproducens inferred from 16 S rRNA amplicon analysis and resolved species ambiguity for E.bolteae, E.lavalensis and L.murinus. Microbiome species which were significantly enriched in after 56 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including B.pseudococcoides, C.difficile, D.welbionis, E.clostridioformis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, E.muris, F.plautii, G.tenuis, H.hathewayi and R.lactatiformans. Significantly depleted species included 17 Firmicutes, including A.muris, Anaerostipes caccae, B.wexlerae, C.scindens, C.cateniformis, E.aldenensis, E.bolteae, E.lavalensis, L.lactis, S.arabinosiphila and as well as the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Delftia lacustris.Differential abundance analysis of WMS identified 13,996 contigs that were significantly different (DESeq2 FDR <0.1) in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 11,087 between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3C–H). From these, 35 putative species (99.0% ANI; Supplementary Note, Data 3) identified as significantly differentially abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0% ANI) significantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an average total length of 180,554 nt. D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52 as a butyrate producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53. Enrichment of D. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight. L. murinus and Acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during spaceflight (Fig. 3A, I), as well as some Enterocloster species after 29 days of spaceflight, which can have high expression of bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such as Clostridium scindens60,61 which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig. 3I, J). The major murine primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). E. muris, which significantly increased in both spaceflight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous to Clostridium scindens. The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)67–69. Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes70,71 but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62 and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with findings from the RR-5 mission39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to spacefight76 and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance of C. difficile after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight is of potential concern if toxigenic. Changes in spaceflight associated metagenome functional prediction Metagenomic functional prediction identified 4,583,759 genes in the co-assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated by Kegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4%) of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated. Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (including tcdAB) from C. difficile, suggesting significant enrichment of the species after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid metabolism genes were identified, including 17 bile salt hydrolases, including that from spaceflight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non-redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI) and I. butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD), species which were significantly depleted after spaceflight as well as A. muris (BaiCD), Eisenbergiella massiliensis (BaiA) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD), species which were significantly enriched after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). E. aldenensis and S. arabinosiphila both contained the important BaiCD gene and were significantly enriched in mice after 29 days of spaceflight but significantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside significant enrichment of the rare 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris, these shifts suggest dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potential influence on the composition of the host bile acid pool56,79. Differential abundance analysis inferred 52,370 genes were significantly different (FDR <0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes after 56 days of spaceflight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572 unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation analysis identified significant (FDR <0.1) increases in pathways of interest related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resistance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and pathogenicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these significant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and specific bacterial species with well-characterised functions, due to spaceflight suggest gut microbiome changes which should influence lipid and bile acid homoeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.

B GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR Over-representation analysis (ORA) of KEGG ontology (Brite, pathway and module) and (C) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS ORA KEGG ontology. Changes in fatty acid pathways included Fatty acid biosynthesis (00061), Fatty acid metabolism (01212), Fatty acid degradation (00071) and Butanoate metabolism (00650), including butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8) and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7). Over-representation of bile acid metabolism was reflected in Bile secretion (04976) and Cholesterol metabolism (04979) and Secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, including bile salt hydrolase (cbh, EC:3.5.1.24) and 3-oxocholoyl-CoA 4-desaturase (baiCD, EC:1.3.1.115). Over-representation of the antimicrobial resistance was represented in Brite ontology Antimicrobial resistance genes (ko01504) and the pathways for beta-Lactam resistance (01501), Biosynthesis of various antibiotics (00998) and Biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (01055). The Brite ontology Bacterial toxins (ko02042) was over-represented, including tight junction interacting zona occludens toxin (K10954), as well as the pathways Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (05130) and Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (05100). Diverse carbohydrate metabolism and ECM interacting pathways were represented by Galactose metabolism (00052), Mannose type O-glycan biosynthesis (00515), Glycosaminoglycan degradation (00531), Other glycan degradation (00511), ECM-receptor interaction (04512) as well as the Brite ontology of Glycosaminoglycan binding proteins (ko00536), Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and degradation proteins (ko01011) and Glycosyltransferases (ko01003). These included putative Mucin-associated glycosyl hydrolases (GHs)185, GH2s: β-galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC:3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC:3.2.1.31), α-l-arabinofuranosidase (EC:3.2.1.55), β-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37), β-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.21), GH20: β-hexosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52), GH29: α-l-fucosidase (EC:3.2.1.51), and GH84: N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52). Spaceflight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host responses to spaceflight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive significant (FDR <0.1) changes after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight when compared to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genes between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 4,476 DE genes between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 5A–H; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43% and 44% were increased due to flight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5I, J), including immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling.

Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–14. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level between 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. This included widespread downregulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after spaceflight, including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was significantly upregulated after 29 days of spaceflight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at the pathway level after 29 days of spaceflight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only 56 days of spaceflight. Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Significant microbiome alteration in some of the few well-characterised 7α-dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increases in E. muris after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens, suggests secondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during spaceflight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51A and Slc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such as Ugt1a1) and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2 transporter)80,81. Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182. After 29 days of spaceflight, Abcc2 was significantly downregulated, suggesting reduced BA export to the colon, while Asbt, Ibabp, Ostα, Ostβ and Ugt1a1 were all significantly upregulated as well as Rxrα (not Fxr), Fgf15/19 and Fgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). Taken together, these changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identified as significantly repressed after 29 days of spaceflight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceflight84 while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after spaceflight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16. As the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dysregulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were significantly upregulated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceflight. After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still significantly repressed and both Abcg5 and Abcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9–14). This was underlined by significant downregulation of the apical bile acid transporter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1)86, indicating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with this was significant increases in expression of Lxrβ, the liver x receptor gene expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acid toxicity through induction of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol excretion87–90. In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after spaceflight, da Silveira et al.18 found that enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various muscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (Bmal1; Arntl) transcription factors, were significantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, and the neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (Npas2) was upregulated after 56 days (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). These regulate the major clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erbα and β) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma (Rorc)91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (Dec1 and Dec2) genes92,93, all of which were significantly downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight except for Rev-Erbα (Nr1d1) (only downregulated after 29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit Clock/Npas2 and Bmal1 as part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF, significantly downregulated, and Nfil3 (E4BP4), significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. These spaceflight-associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of Bmal1, Arntl and Npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle tissue after longer-term spaceflight which were characterised as similar to age-related gene expression on earth96. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity92 and have also been shown to require and interact with the microbiome, including in response to microbially-derived molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)53,92,97–99. In addition to the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the major butyrate receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2; Gpr43)100 was significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101, were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102 reported host immune responses to microbial flagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a downregulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nfil3, which in turn can regulate clock-associated nutrient absorption and immunity. Here, mice followed this specific expression pattern after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), implying the spaceflight associated microbiome alterations could have been recognised and influenced these changes in clock gene expression. Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune compromise during spaceflight Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were underpinned by significant upregulation of collagens (Col1a1-2, Col3a1, Col4a1-2, Col5a1-2, Col5a3, Col6a2-3, Col12a1, Col26a1), laminins (Lama3), thrombospondin (Thbs1) and tenascins (Tnc) in mice after 29 days of spaceflight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregulation of integrin (Itga5 and Itga7) and matrix glycoprotein (Sdc4 and Gp5) receptors, collectively implying extensive extracellular matrix remodelling during spaceflight. The ECM and mucosal collagen scaffold in particular are known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation by pathogenic bacteria104. Significant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and significant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceflight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with microbiota. Mucin 2 (Muc2) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites for microbiota105, but are also differentially expressed in response to pathogens104, including Trichinella106, identified here. Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceflight, including downregulation of CD8a and CD8b1 genes, genes encoding costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40 and ICOSL within intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating binding partners CD48,166,28 and ICOS107–109 (Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5). Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4 involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterial pathogens in murine mucosa110, were also uniformly downregulated (Fig. 5F), alongside others111–113: Ccl3,5,6 and 22, Ccr4,7 and 9, Cxcr2,3 and 6, Il-5,7,12 and 16, and Il-2r,5r,7r,10r,12r,18r,21r,23r and 27r. An exception to this pattern of cytokine downregulation was upregulation IL-23 and IL-22, which interact with circadian regulation95, and specific members of the mucosal homoeostasis critical interleukin 17 family114, Il-17d, which promotes pathogenicity during infection through suppression of CD8 + T cells115, and Il-17rc, which increases expression during compromised epithelial barrier integrity (wounding)116. These expression profiles, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome interface in mice after spaceflight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dysfunction in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceflight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118 and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during spaceflight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments120. Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver Hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identified 4029 DE genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR <0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48% and 49% were increased due to 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6I, J), including disruption of bile acid and energy metabolism. Fig. 6. Microbiome-host metabolism: spaceflight alters liver gene expression. Open in a new tab MA plots showing (A) GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR (29 days of spaceflight) and (B) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS (56 days of spaceflight) differentially expressed genes in the liver (FDR <0.1). C–H Differentially expressed gene from select KEGG pathways of interest, (I) Significant Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 29 days (modified from WebGestalt182), and (J) Significant GSEA 56 days spaceflight. Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 17–21. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. These comprised downregulation of immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease and NAFLD. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer pathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After 29 days of spaceflight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circadian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were upregulated. Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation The most abundant intestinal transcripts in mice after 56 days of spaceflight, differentially expressed and representing 8% and 9% of normalised counts, were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 and Rn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2; Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised as inhibitors of global mitochondrial transcription in mammals121. This is consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristic of spaceflight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de Silveira et al.18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice and astronauts after spaceflight compared ground controls, including upregulation of Fgf21, a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accumulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potent repressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, fibroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1)123, was upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of spaceflight, and the more well known Fgf2116 was significantly upregulated in the liver after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the transformation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the first (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transformation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-specific Cyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 (Acox2) before conjugation by Baat, Acnat1 and Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP)125,126. Cyp51, Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were significantly upregulated and Cyp7a1 and Fxr (Nr1h4) were significantly downregulated in the liver of mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer significantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was significantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended spaceflight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were significantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression profiles suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the production bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent conjugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition. The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of a sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion127. After 29 days of spaceflight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8 being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to spaceflight microbiome changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr (Nr1h4) and Car (Nr1i3) nuclear receptors130, the latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1)131, all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132. Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceflight Beheshti et al.17 observed significant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in mice after spaceflight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and lipid metabolism133 as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts significantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceflight included fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identified as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ136, also significantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by spaceflight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion137, and glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138, were downregulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels previously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during spaceflight139–141. Interestingly, in light of spaceflight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns142 and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPARα pathway143. Other pathways enriched in the liver after spaceflight included Cushing Syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largely downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), including highly significant and high relative abundance increases in CLDN1 and CLDN2. So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)144. More broadly, significant upregulation of Tgf-α and genes involved in complex Tgf-β signalling (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Tab2, Tgfbrap, Smad3), alongside other markers (Dapk2, Vegfa, Dvl3)145,146 are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21cip1; Cdkn1a)147, also significantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ion particle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reported induction of spontaneous HCC146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts after 56 days of spaceflight, if reflected in longer term studies in humans, could represent a serious health concern.",
    "discussion": "Discussion A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days spaceflight) and ISS (56 days spaceflight), and their respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this would represent an important next step likely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceflight pathology.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation.

Copyright notice ID: 11362537 PMID: 39209868 Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms: Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, MicrobiotaIntroduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10 and mesenchymal stem11 cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15 characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38 identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39 explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the genera Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus. In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight. Fig. 1. Experimental design. Open in a new tab A Analysis design of data from the Rodent Research 6 mission and B multiomic data analysis strategy. Figure created with BioRender.com.Results Spaceflight increased total body weight Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two spaceflight groups flown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR, returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceflight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days of spaceflight. Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and 56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceflight are commonly observed40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of spaceflight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9) and significantly increased after 56 days of spaceflight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ significantly (t-test, p > 0.05) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4), respectively, but did significantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1 (±1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n = 9) mice to 32.9 g−1 (±1.0) in FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al.42 observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes to substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy adipose cells play an important role in maintaining insulin sensitivity, dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-inflammatory and insulin-antagonistic molecules43,44.Spaceflight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceflight phenotypes45 which are influenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceflight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS mice (after 56 days of spaceflight). Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after quality control, with an average of 77,015 ± 853 per sample (Fig. 2A–E; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722 (91.32%) of reads. Thirty-five ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of > 99.9% nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised taxa (<99% nucleotide identity; 14 of which were flagged as putative chimeras). Most counts (73.1%) were captured by ESVs annotated as putative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 to multiple species which share identical rRNA gene sequences at the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identified across all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteobacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Deferribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1). Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53.7% of sequence counts. Fig. 2.

Extended details in Supplementary data 1–3.WMS of faecal DNA generated 277,294,078 reads after quality control, with an average of 8,665,440 ± 1,423,541 per sample (Fig. 2F–I; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Data 2). Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw counts after filtering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3) occurrence filtering to allow statistical detection of spaceflight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally annotated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation and filtering for high confidence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length) identified 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and 1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. goldstienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa, representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity49,50. Microbial alpha diversity indices did not significantly differ between mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the first axes explained 25.46% and 17.63% of variation using 16 S rRNA gene amplification and 19.41% and 11.49% of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permutation tests confirmed significant variation between groups under constraint for both amplicon and WMS data (Fig. 2E, I; p <0.05; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3), suggesting spaceflight influenced gut microbiota in both comparisons regardless of the metagenomic approach taken.Significant spaceflight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and pathogenicity Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identified 45 ESVs that were significantly different in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR and 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value = 0.004, av padj = 0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, Data 1). Although there were divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica, the common significant enrichment of E. muris and D. welbionis in mice after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight, compared to separate matched control groups, suggests spaceflight had some common influence of gut microbiota which persisted over the 29–56 days onboard the ISS as well as some distinct effects over time.

Amplicon sequencing: Species enriched in FLT_LAR mice compared to controls included Coprobacillus cateniformis, Dysosmobacter welbionis, Enterocloster aldenensis, Extibacter muris and Hungatella xylanolytica, while depleted species included Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and ESVs ambiguous to multiple Enterocloster species (including E.lavalensis) and Ligilactobacillus species (including L.murinus). Species enriched in FLT_ISS mice included D.welbionis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Enterocloster clostridioformis, E.muris, Guopingia tenuis, Romboutsia ilealis and Romboutsia timonensis, while depleted species included H.xylanolytica. WMS: Microbiome species significantly enriched in after 29 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including Blautia pseudococcoides, Clostridioides difficile, C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris, G.tenuis, Hungatella hathewayi, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila and the proteobacteria Delftia lacustris. Significantly depleted species included 20 firmicutes, including Acutalibacter muris, Anaerostipes caccae, Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium scindens, Enterococcus faecalis, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Enterocloster bolteae, E.lavalensis, Flavonifractor plautii, I.butyriciproducens, Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus xylosus, and the Proteobacteria Providencia rettgeri. These findings agreed with significant differential abundance of C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris and I.butyriciproducens inferred from 16 S rRNA amplicon analysis and resolved species ambiguity for E.bolteae, E.lavalensis and L.murinus. Microbiome species which were significantly enriched in after 56 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including B.pseudococcoides, C.difficile, D.welbionis, E.clostridioformis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, E.muris, F.plautii, G.tenuis, H.hathewayi and R.lactatiformans. Significantly depleted species included 17 Firmicutes, including A.muris, Anaerostipes caccae, B.wexlerae, C.scindens, C.cateniformis, E.aldenensis, E.bolteae, E.lavalensis, L.lactis, S.arabinosiphila and as well as the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Delftia lacustris.Differential abundance analysis of WMS identified 13,996 contigs that were significantly different (DESeq2 FDR <0.1) in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 11,087 between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3C–H). From these, 35 putative species (99.0% ANI; Supplementary Note, Data 3) identified as significantly differentially abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0% ANI) significantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an average total length of 180,554 nt. D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52 as a butyrate producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53. Enrichment of D. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight. L. murinus and Acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during spaceflight (Fig. 3A, I), as well as some Enterocloster species after 29 days of spaceflight, which can have high expression of bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such as Clostridium scindens60,61 which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig. 3I, J). The major murine primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). E. muris, which significantly increased in both spaceflight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous to Clostridium scindens. The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)67–69. Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes70,71 but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62 and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with findings from the RR-5 mission39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to spacefight76 and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance of C. difficile after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight is of potential concern if toxigenic.Changes in spaceflight associated metagenome functional prediction Metagenomic functional prediction identified 4,583,759 genes in the co-assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated by Kegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4%) of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated. Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (including tcdAB) from C. difficile, suggesting significant enrichment of the species after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid metabolism genes were identified, including 17 bile salt hydrolases, including that from spaceflight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non-redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI) and I. butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD), species which were significantly depleted after spaceflight as well as A. muris (BaiCD), Eisenbergiella massiliensis (BaiA) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD), species which were significantly enriched after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). E. aldenensis and S. arabinosiphila both contained the important BaiCD gene and were significantly enriched in mice after 29 days of spaceflight but significantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside significant enrichment of the rare 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris, these shifts suggest dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potential influence on the composition of the host bile acid pool56,79. Differential abundance analysis inferred 52,370 genes were significantly different (FDR <0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes after 56 days of spaceflight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572 unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation analysis identified significant (FDR <0.1) increases in pathways of interest related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resistance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and pathogenicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these significant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and specific bacterial species with well-characterised functions, due to spaceflight suggest gut microbiome changes which should influence lipid and bile acid homoeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.

Changes in fatty acid pathways included Fatty acid biosynthesis (00061), Fatty acid metabolism (01212), Fatty acid degradation (00071) and Butanoate metabolism (00650), including butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8) and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7). Over-representation of bile acid metabolism was reflected in Bile secretion (04976) and Cholesterol metabolism (04979) and Secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, including bile salt hydrolase (cbh, EC:3.5.1.24) and 3-oxocholoyl-CoA 4-desaturase (baiCD, EC:1.3.1.115). Over-representation of the antimicrobial resistance was represented in Brite ontology Antimicrobial resistance genes (ko01504) and the pathways for beta-Lactam resistance (01501), Biosynthesis of various antibiotics (00998) and Biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (01055). The Brite ontology Bacterial toxins (ko02042) was over-represented, including tight junction interacting zona occludens toxin (K10954), as well as the pathways Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (05130) and Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (05100). Diverse carbohydrate metabolism and ECM interacting pathways were represented by Galactose metabolism (00052), Mannose type O-glycan biosynthesis (00515), Glycosaminoglycan degradation (00531), Other glycan degradation (00511), ECM-receptor interaction (04512) as well as the Brite ontology of Glycosaminoglycan binding proteins (ko00536), Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and degradation proteins (ko01011) and Glycosyltransferases (ko01003). These included putative Mucin-associated glycosyl hydrolases (GHs)185, GH2s: β-galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC:3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC:3.2.1.31), α-l-arabinofuranosidase (EC:3.2.1.55), β-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37), β-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.21), GH20: β-hexosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52), GH29: α-l-fucosidase (EC:3.2.1.51), and GH84: N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52).Spaceflight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host responses to spaceflight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive significant (FDR <0.1) changes after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight when compared to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genes between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 4,476 DE genes between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 5A–H; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43% and 44% were increased due to flight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5I, J), including immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling.

Open in a new tab MA plots showing (A) GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR (29 days of spaceflight) and (B) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS (56 days of spaceflight) differentially expressed genes in the colon (FDR <0.1). C–H Differentially expressed gene from select KEGG pathways of interest, (I) Significant Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 29 days (modified from WebGestalt182) and (J) Significant GSEA 56 days spaceflight. Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–14. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level between 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. This included widespread downregulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after spaceflight, including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was significantly upregulated after 29 days of spaceflight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at the pathway level after 29 days of spaceflight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only 56 days of spaceflight.Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Significant microbiome alteration in some of the few well-characterised 7α-dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increases in E. muris after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens, suggests secondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during spaceflight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51A and Slc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such as Ugt1a1) and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2 transporter)80,81. Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182. After 29 days of spaceflight, Abcc2 was significantly downregulated, suggesting reduced BA export to the colon, while Asbt, Ibabp, Ostα, Ostβ and Ugt1a1 were all significantly upregulated as well as Rxrα (not Fxr), Fgf15/19 and Fgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). Taken together, these changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identified as significantly repressed after 29 days of spaceflight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceflight84 while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after spaceflight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16. As the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dysregulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were significantly upregulated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceflight. After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still significantly repressed and both Abcg5 and Abcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9–14). This was underlined by significant downregulation of the apical bile acid transporter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1)86, indicating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with this was significant increases in expression of Lxrβ, the liver x receptor gene expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acid toxicity through induction of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol excretion87–90. In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after spaceflight, da Silveira et al.18 found that enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various muscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (Bmal1; Arntl) transcription factors, were significantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, and the neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (Npas2) was upregulated after 56 days (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). These regulate the major clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erbα and β) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma (Rorc)91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (Dec1 and Dec2) genes92,93, all of which were significantly downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight except for Rev-Erbα (Nr1d1) (only downregulated after 29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit Clock/Npas2 and Bmal1 as part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF, significantly downregulated, and Nfil3 (E4BP4), significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. These spaceflight-associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of Bmal1, Arntl and Npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle tissue after longer-term spaceflight which were characterised as similar to age-related gene expression on earth96. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity92 and have also been shown to require and interact with the microbiome, including in response to microbially-derived molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)53,92,97–99. In addition to the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the major butyrate receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2; Gpr43)100 was significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101, were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102 reported host immune responses to microbial flagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a downregulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nfil3, which in turn can regulate clock-associated nutrient absorption and immunity. Here, mice followed this specific expression pattern after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), implying the spaceflight associated microbiome alterations could have been recognised and influenced these changes in clock gene expression.Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune compromise during spaceflight Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were underpinned by significant upregulation of collagens (Col1a1-2, Col3a1, Col4a1-2, Col5a1-2, Col5a3, Col6a2-3, Col12a1, Col26a1), laminins (Lama3), thrombospondin (Thbs1) and tenascins (Tnc) in mice after 29 days of spaceflight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregulation of integrin (Itga5 and Itga7) and matrix glycoprotein (Sdc4 and Gp5) receptors, collectively implying extensive extracellular matrix remodelling during spaceflight. The ECM and mucosal collagen scaffold in particular are known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation by pathogenic bacteria104. Significant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and significant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceflight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with microbiota. Mucin 2 (Muc2) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites for microbiota105, but are also differentially expressed in response to pathogens104, including Trichinella106, identified here. Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceflight, including downregulation of CD8a and CD8b1 genes, genes encoding costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40 and ICOSL within intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating binding partners CD48,166,28 and ICOS107–109 (Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5). Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4 involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterial pathogens in murine mucosa110, were also uniformly downregulated (Fig. 5F), alongside others111–113: Ccl3,5,6 and 22, Ccr4,7 and 9, Cxcr2,3 and 6, Il-5,7,12 and 16, and Il-2r,5r,7r,10r,12r,18r,21r,23r and 27r. An exception to this pattern of cytokine downregulation was upregulation IL-23 and IL-22, which interact with circadian regulation95, and specific members of the mucosal homoeostasis critical interleukin 17 family114, Il-17d, which promotes pathogenicity during infection through suppression of CD8 + T cells115, and Il-17rc, which increases expression during compromised epithelial barrier integrity (wounding)116. These expression profiles, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome interface in mice after spaceflight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dysfunction in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceflight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118 and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during spaceflight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments120.Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver Hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identified 4029 DE genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR <0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48% and 49% were increased due to 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6I, J), including disruption of bile acid and energy metabolism. Fig. 6. Microbiome-host metabolism: spaceflight alters liver gene expression. Open in a new tab MA plots showing (A) GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR (29 days of spaceflight) and (B) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS (56 days of spaceflight) differentially expressed genes in the liver (FDR <0.1). C–H Differentially expressed gene from select KEGG pathways of interest, (I) Significant Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 29 days (modified from WebGestalt182), and (J) Significant GSEA 56 days spaceflight. Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 17–21. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. These comprised downregulation of immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease and NAFLD. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer pathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After 29 days of spaceflight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circadian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were upregulated.Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation The most abundant intestinal transcripts in mice after 56 days of spaceflight, differentially expressed and representing 8% and 9% of normalised counts, were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 and Rn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2; Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised as inhibitors of global mitochondrial transcription in mammals121. This is consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristic of spaceflight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de Silveira et al.18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice and astronauts after spaceflight compared ground controls, including upregulation of Fgf21, a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accumulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potent repressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, fibroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1)123, was upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of spaceflight, and the more well known Fgf2116 was significantly upregulated in the liver after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the transformation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the first (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transformation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-specific Cyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 (Acox2) before conjugation by Baat, Acnat1 and Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP)125,126. Cyp51, Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were significantly upregulated and Cyp7a1 and Fxr (Nr1h4) were significantly downregulated in the liver of mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer significantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was significantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended spaceflight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were significantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression profiles suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the production bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent conjugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition. The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of a sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion127. After 29 days of spaceflight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8 being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to spaceflight microbiome changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr (Nr1h4) and Car (Nr1i3) nuclear receptors130, the latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1)131, all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132.Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceflight Beheshti et al.17 observed significant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in mice after spaceflight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and lipid metabolism133 as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts significantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceflight included fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identified as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ136, also significantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by spaceflight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion137, and glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138, were downregulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels previously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during spaceflight139–141. Interestingly, in light of spaceflight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns142 and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPARα pathway143. Other pathways enriched in the liver after spaceflight included Cushing Syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largely downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), including highly significant and high relative abundance increases in CLDN1 and CLDN2. So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)144. More broadly, significant upregulation of Tgf-α and genes involved in complex Tgf-β signalling (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Tab2, Tgfbrap, Smad3), alongside other markers (Dapk2, Vegfa, Dvl3)145,146 are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21cip1; Cdkn1a)147, also significantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ion particle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reported induction of spontaneous HCC146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts after 56 days of spaceflight, if reflected in longer term studies in humans, could represent a serious health concern.Discussion A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days spaceflight) and ISS (56 days spaceflight), and their respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this would represent an important next step likely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceflight pathology.Conclusions Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.Methods Experimental design Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR, were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions (replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/light cycle maintained. After 29 days of flight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18) and sacrificed alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacrificed after 53–56 days of flight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1 Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1 South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive - ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of spaceflight, so were not significantly different (t-test, p > 0.05) between flight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (±0.35) °C, 41.49 (±2.28) % and 3219 (±340) CO2 ppm, respectively. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on October 24, 2017, by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab record (OSD-249), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using isoflurane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine during the dissection period, which occurred 53–56 days post-launch. Blood samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture, though these were not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination followed by thoracotomy. The ISS spaceflight mice carcasses underwent hind limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped in aluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at −80 °C or colder until return. The ISS Ground Control followed the same euthanasia methods and preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental endpoints included the collection of blood samples, completion of hind limb dissection, and collection of faecal samples. Faecal samples were extruded from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for further analysis.DNA extraction Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n = 9 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 7 mice from GC_LAR, n = 7 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is available in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249.16S rRNA gene amplification DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol149,150. In the first stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) containing Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage and incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell, employing paired-end 2 × 153 base reads.Whole metagenome sequencing Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and five cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragment sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center).RNA extraction and sequencing Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 8 mice from GC_LAR, n = 9 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 9 mice from GC_LAR, n = 10 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were ~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed. Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab records OSD-247 (colon) or OSD-245 (liver).16S rRNA gene barcoding Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor28,35,139,151,152. Exact sequence variants (ESV) were identified in place of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur155 and a count threshold parameter of 96. Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the  16 S curated and  nr/nt databases (January 2022 versions). Differentially abundant ESVs were manually assessed for quality. When the highest identity/coverage was shared amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained and reported. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was applied159.Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161 and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARAMETERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --paired --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163 was used to remove potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164 with the following parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165 was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166 expectation maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assignment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168 was used with the option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169 was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a first alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the  nr/nt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from  refseq informed by first iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity > 97%, total alignment length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to WMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases ( nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL, InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as input in the GhostKOALA webserver170 to add functional genes and pathways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999).Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was performed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classification was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classification of metagenome assembled genomes173.Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled following NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174.Alpha and beta diversity To estimate and compare microbial richness within samples, alpha diversity was measured using diversity indices using Phyloseq R library175 and was compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination) was performed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with normalised counts (Supplementary Data 1) while constrained ordination was based on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA). Significance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library176 was used to conduct these analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. As an exploratory visualisation of annotated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalised counts of differentially abundant species (30 in each comparison) were selected as input and umap function from the umap R package (v 0.2.10) was used for each comparison with default parameters. Care should be taken when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS microbiome profiling lacks absolute quantification and is vulnerable to biases from PCR amplification and/or sequencing depth.Differential abundance/expression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be at least ≥ 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2159 based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/contigs/ORFs/transcripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical significance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inflated abundance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros and flagged as significantly differentially abundant. To address conservative p-value distribution179 of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180 R library.Functional enrichment analysis Ghostkoala output was organised into a gene count table using WMS ORF raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) of WMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs (FDR <0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data 4). p-values were calculated using a hypergeometric test using clusterProfiler (v4.7.1.003) R library181. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182 platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining significance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184 R annotation library.Supplementary information Supplementary Material (2.4MB, pdf) nr-reporting-summary (1.6MB, pdf) 41522_2024_545_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx (86.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary file 1 – RR6 amplicon-based metagenomics 41522_2024_545_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx (7.1MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 4 – RR6 WMS-based function 41522_2024_545_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx (5.3MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 5 – RR6 host transcriptomics 41522_2024_545_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx (102.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary file 2 – RR6 WMS processing summary 41522_2024_545_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx (3.3MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 3 – RR6 WMS-based taxonomy Acknowledgements This research was generated by the NASA GeneLab Analysis Working Group for Microbes.

Subject terms: Stem cells, Stem-cell research, Stem cellsIntroduction Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advancements in stem cell biology within regenerative medicine as well as innovations in space technologies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been increasingly supportive of academic and commercial groups using microgravity for research and product development with potential benefits for use on Earth1,2. There is a growing interest in evaluating the potential for stem cells and their derived tissues in space to model human disease mechanisms and treat diseases through cell therapy. At the start of human spaceflight, the primary focus of life science research conducted in space was to understand the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment including microgravity on humans to keep them alive and well in this extreme environment. Additionally, medical research in space has uncovered valuable evidence about the effects of microgravity on the human condition including biological processes and disease pathways. A great wealth of knowledge about cells and tissues has been known in biomedical space research. In recent years, there has been an emerging interest from scientists, governments, and commercial entities to investigate human health in space for the benefit of humans on Earth too. Studying stem cells in space has uncovered their behavior in an environment other than Earth, revealing mechanisms which would otherwise be undetected or unknown with the inevitable presence of normal gravity. This includes changes to stem cell proliferation rates, differentiation, and lineage phenotypes3–6. Stem cell research performed in space has shown potential ways microgravity can be leveraged to advance cellular therapeutics in space to benefit human life and commercial enterprise on Earth7. This paper reviews important discoveries that have occurred in real microgravity conditions on the ISS demonstrating the impact of microgravity on fundamental stem cell properties relevant to regenerative medicine practices and therapeutics on Earth3,8–14. We present here different areas of stem cell research conducted in space that have potential to translate to terrestrial applications within the context of developing cellular therapies while also highlighting the limitations and opposing evidence available. Prior to these spaceflight studies, little was known about the role of microgravity in influencing human stem cell growth and fate. We are just starting to understand the ways in which a microgravity environment influences stem cell function, division, and survival.Stem cell studies in space and their potential application The main types of stem cells used in clinical and experimental cell therapy are pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells include embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, embryonic germ cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs are specialized human stem cells created in the lab from a person’s blood or skin cells and can generate nearly any cell in the body, and hence, can be used in regenerative medicine therapies. They are derived from direct reprogramming of postnatal/adult somatic cells in vitro. They also carry an individual’s own DNA making them ideal for creating tailored treatments for diseases and are essential in the field of personalized medicine. Currently, the clinical use of pluripotent stem cells largely lacks therapeutic evidence and is constrained to investigational regenerative medicine15–17. As for adult stem cells, they are rare, undifferentiated stem cells which replenish cells and contribute to growth and repair of tissue by giving rise to progenitor cells which differentiate into the required cell types. Adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skin stem cells (SSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs)18. With current tissue engineering technologies and advancements in gene editing techniques, stem cells can be remodeled into three-dimensional organoids and tissue structures, further exacerbating their use in personalized regenerative applications19. Stem cell-based therapies are a possible treatment for age-related conditions including stroke, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, among other conditions and injuries. However, such treatments may require large amounts of stem cells, and this is difficult to achieve since expanding stem cells for therapies remains a challenge20. One of the most important factors influencing therapeutic effects of stem cells is their culture environment, including presence or absence of gravitational forces. Microgravity is recognized as a novel culture environment for stem cells as a result of the unique changes which can occur in a microgravity culture4. Different research groups around the world have been working on expanding stem cells in space for use in terrestrial studies and practices. This is a result of the advantages that the microgravity environment provides to cells in space. The goal of almost all these spaceflight studies is to enhance growth of large amounts of safe and high-quality clinical-grade stem cells with minimal cell differentiation. The studies also evaluate the feasibility of successful harvest and transport of the space expanded stem cells back to Earth. Optimizing these experiments and creating standardized protocols can enable the growth of stem cells in space for patient use on Earth. The space environment offers an advantage to the growth of stem cells by providing a more natural three-dimensional (3D) state for their expansion which closely resembles growth of cells in the human body, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) culture environment available on Earth which less likely imitates real tissue21. A 3D cell culture system better mimics the behaviors and reactions of cells in vivo than 2D systems by simulating native cell-cell interactions and development. Therefore, scientists are interested in the effects of microgravity in creating a 3D cell culture system for stem cells by offloading the gravitational forces exerted on cells and replicating physiological composition of cells and their spatial arrangements22. Different types of stem cells have been sent into space to assess whether space is in fact an ideal platform to produce large quantities of stem cells and eventually improve treatments on Earth.Types of stem cells studied in space Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) have been sent to the ISS and returned for analysis. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics including their biology, stemness, and fate choice towards specific lineages were evaluated to ensure their maintenance of identity and safety (Table 1). These stem cells are vital for stem cell therapy including bone marrow transplant for the treatment of bone or blood cancers, and helping patients recover neurons and blood vessels after a stroke. Successfully growing stem cells in space and maintaining their stemness without differentiation into other downstream lineages while bringing them back to Earth in good condition can make these cells feasible for use in patients in the future (Fig. 1). Table 1. Overview of spaceflight studies that investigated human stem cell culture during spaceflight and the potential applications and benefits on Earth Stem cell type Duration of cell culture on the ISS (mission) Main findings Potential applications and benefits Study Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 14 days (SpaceX CRS-10) • MSCs maintained their morphological and phenotypic characteristics. • MSCs maintained their proliferative capabilities. • Down-regulation in expression of PLK1, suggesting µG may slow progression of MSCs at later stages of the cell cycle during longer-term culture. • MSCs maintained their differentiation capacity. • MSCs exhibited enhanced immunosuppressive capacity. • No evidence of tumorigenic transformation. • It is feasible to grow MSC in space for human application on Earth. • MSCs expanded on the ISS could be clinically used to treat inflammatory conditions. Huang et al.8 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 11 days (STS-63) and 13 days (STS-69) • CD34+ cells maintained cell viability >95%. • Significant decrease in growth potential of multilineage, particularly erythroid, hematopoietic progenitor cells. • The decrease in progenitor cell pool is coupled to an increase in terminally differentiated macrophages. • CD34+ cells can be expanded in space, given the right culture conditions. • µG may have direct effects on in vivo hematopoiesis during early primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and may be a significant component of the clinical syndrome of spaceflight anemia. Davis et al.9 Cardiomyocytes derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC-CMs) 5.5 weeks (SpaceX CRS-9) • hiPSC-CMs retained sarcomeric structure and morphology. • hiPSC-CMs retained contraction and relaxation velocities. • hiPSC-CMs demonstrated unchanged Ca2+ transient amplitude but showed a significant increase in transient decay tau, indicating a decreased calcium recycling rate. • Gene-expression pathways related to mitochondrial function were upregulated. • Binding motifs for transcription factors known to regulate cardiac metabolism were enriched. • In-space hiPSC-CMs are the best model currently available for studying human cardiac function in response to microgravity at the cellular level. • Long-term cell culture of highly specialized hiPSC-CMs is possible in space. • Along with other platforms like 3D engineered heart tissues or organoids, hiPSC-CMs may enable prevention or treatment strategies to be developed for spaceflight-induced cardiac remodeling and other conditions found on Earth. Wnorowski et al.10 Cardiac progenitor spheres derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC-cardiac progenitors) 3 weeks (SpaceX-20) • Cardiac sphere cultures recovered beating activity 2–3 days post-flight. • Cardiac spheres were greater in size, had greater nuclei counts of live cells and contained more cells at the active phase of the cell cycle. • Cardiac spheres showed increased proliferative capacity. • Cardiac progenitor spheres were able to differentiate into highly enriched cardiomyocytes. • They had improved cellular and structural parameters, and calcium signalling. • Genes associated with cardiac development, cell cycle, proliferation, survival, and cardiac functions were upregulated. • Genes related to extracellular matrix and apoptosis were downregulated. • Long-term spaceflight can generate enriched cardiomyocytes with improved proliferation and features. • Combination of µG and 3D culture provided a novel method to increase proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitors. • This study shows therapeutic application of hiPSC-CMs since therapy requires large amounts of cells with improved ability for engraftment and also cells with high quality (including improved maturation and function to improve safety of cell therapy). • Genes and pathways involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation, survival, and differentiation were analyzed, providing targets for future manipulation of these pathways. Rampoldi et al.11 Cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) 12 days (SpaceX CRS-11) • CPCs show markers of early cardiovascular development and maintain differentiation capacity. • 14 microRNAs exhibited significant changes in levels of expression in CPCs in space. • Cytoskeletal maintenance was altered in neonatal CPCs but not adult CPCs. • Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated. • Expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) were elevated in neonatal CPCs. • Neonatal CPCs showed increased expression of genes involved in pre-mesodermal development. • Neonatal CPCs in space proliferated more rapidly than adult or ground-control CPCs. • CPCs showed increased DNA repair transcripts following spaceflight. • Stress response genes were induced in CPCs. • No transcripts associated with apoptosis were observed. • CPCs demonstrated greater migratory capacity. • The induction of mesendodermal markers and Tbx gene expression reflects potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair. Baio et al.3 30 days (SpaceX CRS-11) • Adult CPCs co-expressed several markers of early cardiovascular differentiation. • Adult CPCs expressed higher YAP1 levels in µG, especially after 12 days, but this declined at 30 days. • Adult CPCs maintained their viability and proliferative capabilities. • Further studies defining the functional and safety implications of µG-activated cells in a model of cardiovascular repair would provide insight regarding µG-mediated conditioning in vivo. • Induction of adult CPCs to over-express YAP1 is a step towards conditioning these progenitors to have reparative potential closer to that of neonatal CPCs.

Open in a new tab Created with BioRender.com.Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are known to have potential as therapeutic agents. However, their safe and efficient expansion while maintaining stem cell properties is still a major challenge in the field23. Nonetheless, a study conducted by Huang et al.8 evaluated the feasibility, potency, and safety of growing human bone marrow derived MSCs in space for potential future clinical applications. The MSCs were grown on the ISS for two weeks and different analyses were performed on them after their return to Earth. The results of this study showed that MSCs maintained their phenotype and proliferative characteristics after expansion on the ISS, prior microgravity exposure did not influence MSC differentiation abilities, and several cytokines and growth factors were significantly altered by microgravity and dependent on duration of exposure. MSCs grown in space showed enhanced immunosuppressive capabilities compared to those cultured on Earth. Also, no evidence of malignant transformation or genomic integrity compromise were found as demonstrated via the chromosomal, DNA damage and tumorigenicity assays8. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that MSC cultures maintained in microgravity may be used for cell-based therapy in diseases of the central nervous system. Results collected via gene expression profiling from the experiment “Stroma-2” performed aboard the ISS showed that in-space mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs had higher expression of genes involved in neural development, neuron morphogenesis, and transmission of nerve impulse and synapse than MSCs grown on Earth24. Also, human MSCs cultured in simulated microgravity demonstrated therapeutic properties in a mouse model of acute injury via significantly higher expression of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors compared to MSCs cultured in normal gravity25. Brain-injured mice that were transplanted with MSCs cultured in microgravity showed greater motor functional recovery than those transplanted with MSCs cultured in normal gravity26. Similarly, rat bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured in simulated microgravity which were transplanted into a rat model of spinal cord injury showed enhanced functional improvement and therapeutic effects27. Although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear, the results of these various stem cell transplantation studies demonstrate the benefits of using simulated microgravity as part of the culture experimental design to enhance therapeutic effects of MSCs using cell-based therapy for central nervous system diseases. Nonetheless, simulated microgravity has been shown to inhibit the migration of rat MSCs28 and suppress the differentiation of human MSCs6,29,30, mouse MSCs26, and rat MSCs27,31. Suppression of differentiation under microgravity may alter generation of multiple tissue lineages in space32. However, inhibition of differentiation of MSCs preserves their stemness and allows them to maintain their stem cell identity. This could help expand the cells in space for clinical application on Earth. Furthermore, simulated microgravity has been seen to inhibit proliferation of MSCs in some studies31 and show increased proliferation compared to those cultured in normal gravity in others6. Therefore, conflicting data is present on the behavior of MSCs in microgravity, and hence, their potential benefits in stem cell-based therapy needs to be further explored.Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are primarily found in the bone marrow and give rise to all mature blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets33. The effects of spaceflight on human HSC proliferation and differentiation were explored in vitro via culture of CD34+ bone marrow-derived cells in suspension for 11 days during the space shuttle mission STS-63 (Discovery) and 13 days during STS-69 (Endeavour). Compared to ground control samples, the in-space HSCs exhibited a significant decline in the growth of myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell numbers. The in-space HSCs also showed an absolute increase in terminally differentiated macrophages, suggesting accelerated differentiation towards the macrophage lineage. The study indicates that the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs is impacted by microgravity with erythropoiesis being particularly sensitive to changes in gravity. Therefore, gravity may play a key role in certain pathways and biological processes of in vitro hematopoiesis9. Additionally, these findings suggest that spaceflight anemia may be a result of suppression of erythropoiesis by microgravity, among other factors9,34,35. The reduced differentiation observed within in-space HSCs suggests that microgravity may play a role in preserving the stemness of HSCs, and hence, may be used as HSC therapy in which they can be given to patients to produce functional and terminally differentiated cells. It remains to be established that space expanded HSC can produce functional and terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells on Earth. On the contrary, a significant decrease in the number of mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was reported during 12 days of spaceflight and simulated microgravity, mainly by blocking cell cycle at G1/S transition. However, their differentiation abilities were not affected36. In addition to this, a study which analyzed peripheral blood samples from six astronauts who had participated in spaceflight missions found significant changes in several cell populations at different time points, including HSCs. The changes to lineage cells and HSCs were further studied in a mouse model, using hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, and found a reduction in frequency of NK cells, B cells, and erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and increase in frequency of T cells, neutrophils, and HSCs. Deep sequencing showed changes in the expression of regulatory molecules important for the differentiation of HSCs, and hence, their findings demonstrated that spaceflight and simulated microgravity may disrupt the homeostasis of immune system and cause dynamic changes to both HSCs and lineage cells37. Additionally, simulated microgravity was shown to significantly inhibit the migration potential, cell-cycle progression and differentiation patterns in primitive HSC38 and impair DNA damage repair in human HSCs39. Profound changes to HSCs may limit their applications in stem cell-based therapies.Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells The heart has limited ability in regenerating lost cardiomyocytes following an adverse event like a heart attack40,41. However, cardiomyocytes derived from human iPSCs may be a potential solution to replacing lost and dead cells in such an event. Wnorowski et al. 2019 analyzed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) following 5.5 weeks of culture in space on the ISS. Analysis of gene expression, structure, and functions of these cells in comparison with ground control hiPSC-CMs was done. The differences observed include changes in calcium handling while RNA-sequencing showed differential expression of 2635 genes among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, specifically upregulated genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. No significant differences in cell morphology or sarcomere structure between spaceflight and ground control samples were seen. This study demonstrated the use of hiPSC-CMs to model the effects of microgravity in space, showing that the cells change their functional properties in spaceflight and compensate for the reduction in gravity by altering their gene expression patterns at the cellular level. Also, this study demonstrated the successful culture and return of viable cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs which may pose potential therapeutic use10. Additionally, another study investigated hiPSC-CMs in space, starting with hiPSC-cardiac progenitors. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac progenitors differentiated into cardiomyocytes and showed 3-fold larger sphere sizes, 20-fold higher counts of nuclei, and increased expression of proliferation markers compared to ground control samples, following three weeks on the ISS. In-space hiPSC-CMs also demonstrated increased expression of contraction-associated genes and enhanced calcium handling. Transient exposure to microgravity (3 days) showed upregulation in genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and contraction11. Therefore, the successful expansion of hiPSC-CMs derived from hiPSC-cardiac progenitors in space resulted in efficient production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes with the required features for function, and thus, may present potential therapeutic applications. These findings are supported by another study in which cardiac spheres derived from hiPSCs in simulated microgravity culture showed enhanced production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes (99% purity) with high viability (90%), upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and survival and expected functional properties5. During iPSC generation, the gravity-induced tension present on Earth is absent under microgravity conditions, possibly making it easier for stem cells to multiply quicker.Cardiovascular progenitor cells Cardiac regeneration is limited due to insufficient numbers of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), low self-renewal potency and production of immature cardiomyocytes, among other reasons42. Current clinical trials which stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising43,44 but are limited as a result of cells failing to engraft into the host tissue and use of progenitor cells restricted in potency45. CPCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into the three main cell types of cardiac tissue including cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells46. Therefore, characterizing the molecular events which encourage stemness in CPCs during spaceflight may have implications for enhancing their regenerative potential for stem cell-based cardiac repair. CPCs shift from silent to active phases during processes of tissue regeneration which contributes to their differentiation into new myocytes and endothelial cells47. On the ISS, neonatal and adult CPCs were cultured, and both showed increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, and enhanced migration. Changes in cytoskeletal modifications as a result of reduced mechanotransduction were reported3,12. The findings showed that neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers and proliferative potential while adult CPCs did not3. An increased understanding of the response of CPCs to microgravity in space and identification of novel targets for enhancing therapies can help advance novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies on Earth3,12. Additionally, microgravity in space activated yes-associated protein (YAP1), a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway which regulates cell proliferation and cardiac development48–51 in adult CPCs which have potential benefit for cardiovascular repair. The study suggests that inducing adult CPCs to overexpress YAP1 can enable these progenitors to have regeneration potential similar to that of neonatal CPCs12. This is particularly significant in the field of cardiac regeneration, given that the human heart has limited regeneration capabilities.Neural stem cells Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human iPSCs were cultured on the ISS and then returned to Earth. Analysis of these cells showed that they preserved their stemness and were able to proliferate in space while also remaining as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended in the same culture medium in space. These in-space NSCs were able to maintain their ability to become young neurons when cultured in neuronal specification media (NSM) upon return, indicating that exposure to microgravity in space did not change their potential to choose the neuronal fate. Additionally, neuroblasts proliferated for over a week when placed in NSM before deciding to mature13. These findings show that microgravity is an excellent tool to increase neural cell numbers without the need to perform genetic manipulations of long-term treatments with mitogens. This is relevant to advancing human health on Earth since neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from loss of a specific cell population and perhaps in-space grown NSCs can be a potential solution. Investigating the effects of microgravity in space on the regulation of NSCs and their commitment to a specific lineage can offer benefits to patients on Earth for cell replacement therapies and recovery of CNS structure and function. This can be done by using donor cells from the patients themselves to address neurodegenerative and development disorders including cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, and then developing personalized treatments for them. In addition to this, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptomic profiling revealed that NSCs maintained greater stemness ability during spaceflight via elevation of markers for stemness including Sox2, Pax6, and Notch1 despite reduction in growth rate. Also, the increased expression of mature neuron marker Map2 and decrease in astrocyte marker Gfap and the oligodendrocyte markers Gal and Olig2 demonstrated NSCs’ tendency to differentiate into neurons in space. These findings suggest that culture in outer space combined with biomaterial-based 3D culture system may improve the neural differentiation abilities of NSCs in vitro and contribute to tissue engineering. Further understanding of the mechanisms which occur in NSCs during spaceflight could improve our knowledge and unveil potential benefits for NSC-based regenerative medicine52. Also, boundary cap neural crest stem cells exposed to real microgravity in space showed improved viability and increased survival and proliferation compared to cells exposed to simulated gravity on Earth, with significantly different gene expression patterns for proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation between the space and simulated microgravity groups53. Conflicting evidence persists since in-space NSCs experience a reduction in growth rate in space52 but also proliferate at a higher rate and up to 72 h following spaceflight, irrespective of flight duration54,55. Furthermore, a recent study which assessed the behavior of in-space NSCs that readapted to Earth’s gravity found that although most of these cells survived spaceflight and self-renewed, some showed enhanced stress responses and autophagy-like behavior via secretome and proteomics analysis56 and increased energy production demands57. Also, NSCs derived from hiPSCs which remained onboard the ISS for 39.6 days before returning to Earth showed an increased number of abnormal cell division events between one- and two-weeks post-space flight58. Nonetheless, the different cell types that form the central nervous system, either individually or collectively, may respond to microgravity in different ways56. Also, the culture hardware used in space may play a role in how cells respond.Further benefits In addition to using in-space stem cells for clinical use on Earth, there are many other benefits that result from this scientific endeavor. Stem cells in space can be used as tools for scientists in disease modelling to test new therapeutics when studying a specific disease. Performing such experiments expands the use of space as a unique and natural environment in biomedical research to study biological phenomena to manipulate cell processes. Also, advancing in-space expansion of stem cells opens the door to exploring many other cell types and potential therapeutics to be evaluated and tested in microgravity, besides stem cells. Such research also encourages the study of organoids in space which may hold promising regenerative medicine and translational stem cell applications59. Additionally, the potential privatization and/or commercialization of in-space stem cells allows the acceleration of research and technology development in low Earth orbit (LEO), further expanding the medical commerce in space and valuable biomanufacturing enterprises. The advancements currently taking place in space infrastructure technologies are promising in reducing costs and increasing frequency to access space7. Growing stem cells in space pushes the boundaries of creativity and innovation in seeking ways to help patients and advancing medical practice forward, that may not be replicated in a terrestrial setting. Using the LEO environment to expand stem cells and other products for scientific research and clinical use could provide insights that have significant impacts to the greater scientific community and public. Furthermore, understanding how stem cells behave in space and their subsequent expansion helps the development of suitable countermeasures to protect astronauts from problems encountered during long-duration spaceflight missions. It benefits current and future space travelers as more knowledge is known about the effects of microgravity on the behavior of stem cells. An interdisciplinary approach including experts from a range of disciplines is required to achieve the full benefits of utilizing space to expand stem cells and stem cell-derived tissues for the benefit of mankind.Current limitations and gaps Despite the potential benefits to using stem cells grown in space for clinical use, there remain limitations and gaps in our knowledge, scientific practices, and funding capabilities to make this a reality for patients. Studying stem cells in space and investigating their safety and feasibility for use in cellular therapies is still in its infancy. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity on stem cell growth and differentiation is needed. It is yet to be established whether microgravity induces expansion (quantity) or potency/stemness (quality) or both and whether the effect is universal to all types of stem cells60. There is conflicting evidence in the literature about the regenerative potential of various types of stem cells, as benefits associated with culturing stem cells in microgravity are reported for mesenchymal stem cells6,8,24–26 hematopoietic stem cells9, cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs10,11,61, cardiovascular progenitor cells3,12 and neural stem cells13,52–55 and disadvantages for mesenchymal stem cells6,26–30, hematopoietic stem cells36–39 and neural stem cells52,56–58. Additionally, it has been reported that microgravity reduces regenerative potential of other stem cells including embryonic stem cells32. While simulated microgravity is seen to inhibit osteogenesis of MSCs31,62, it is also seen to increase adipogenesis62. There is limited understanding of how microgravity in space affects stem cell differentiation since on Earth this is a major barrier to expanding large quantities of stem cells. Also, optimal cell culture media for the in vitro expansion of stem cells while maintaining stemness and limiting differentiation is not well-established60. Further research is required to understand the stem cell-specific changes which occur in space to different types of stem cells, how to leverage and target those benefits while minimizing the disadvantages, and potential implications for regenerative therapeutics. Additionally, different stem cell samples from different donors and sources need to be tested. The variability which exists in stem cell potency between different cell lines and the inability to maintain potency and genetic integrity with cell proliferation is still a challenge7. Also, it is important to note that on Earth and especially with ageing, stem cell exhaustion occurs. This is known as the decrease in stem cell abundance and activity where they stop dividing after a couple of population doublings63. Whether stem cell exhaustion happens in space needs to be studied, especially since the spaceflight microgravity environment induces an accelerated ageing phenotype in many in vivo physiological systems64–66. Furthermore, microgravity is not the only major environmental change that stem cells are exposed to in space. Ionizing radiation (IR) in space affects stem cells, particularly when they are dividing, and this can transform cells to be malignant. Research has shown that stem cells exposed to simulated cosmic galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation or solar energetic particles (SEP) experience dramatic changes in their differentiation potential and report increased apoptosis, delayed DNA repair, DNA damage and mutations which may lead to leukemic transformation within the hematopoietic system67–69. Although IR exposure is associated with an increase in cancer risk, particularly leukemias, the exact mechanisms underlying IR-induced malignancy remain poorly understood70–72. The effects of IR on tissues are complex and the causation of oncogenic mutations is not the only mechanism to explain the relationship between IR and cancers, among other factors73. Evidence of the overall carcinogenic susceptibility of stem cells in space, whether influenced by cosmic radiation, microgravity, or other stressors as contributing factors, is limited, and needs to be understood to assess the feasibility of growing stem cells in space for use on Earth. The costs associated with this sort of research and large-scale production of in-space stem cells for patient use is high and limited by the challenges of launching and performing experiments in space. There is also a need for validation of in-space products for terrestrial applications. Nonetheless, recent scientific research efforts and global forums like the 2020 Biomanufacturing in Space symposium have outlined the foundations required to leverage microgravity in LEO to advance stem cell therapeutics and biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine purposes. An extensive roadmap to overcoming barriers is required where financial investments are coupled with scientific research and innovation7. Also, stem cells grown in space for research and subsequent therapies must follow the best practices and guidelines currently in place. This includes abiding by the International Stem Cell Initiative (ICSI) and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) standard74. Nevertheless, major developments and discoveries addressing stem cells in space have occurred in the past decade alone which can propel this unique branch of regenerative medicine further.Returning to Earth: requirements and considerations for in-space stem cell use in patients While stem cell research in space provides valuable insights into effects of the spaceflight environment on their behavior, including both benefits and existing challenges, their therapeutic translation requires establishing standard safety and functionality protocols and suitable regulatory approvals. The studies in this review show that the spaceflight environment does not harm the different types of stem cells investigated and may enhance their quantity and/or quality. However, it is important to also investigate whether stem cells cultured in space can do their job effectively when back on Earth. It is not enough that stem cells can grow in space and retain their stem cell characteristics. Further studies must investigate the safety, functionality, and feasibility of growing stem cells in space for patient use and make a conclusion about whether the advantages in space outweigh the challenges and costs. Also, they must address whether there is a significant benefit and novelty in choosing to expand stem cells in space than on Earth particularly for clinical use. Stem cells grown in space are different to those grown on Earth, and so, specific protocols and safety checkpoints unique to them must be created and followed. Analyses regarding their suitability to be used in cell therapy must be established while passing the required quality control procedures and regulatory guidelines, including further research and clinical trials (Table 2). Also, since different types of stem cells react differently in space, a comprehensive framework identifying the stem cell-specific changes which happen are crucial moving forward. Table 2. Steps towards clinical application Steps Goals and objectives Estimated time frame Pre-clinical studies needed for generation of space grown cells • Identity: ensure that the basic identity of space grown stem cells has not significantly changed because of exposure to the space environment. • Purity: characterize the space grown stem cells to ascertain the product’s cell composition describing the proportion of stem cells and other differentiated cells. • Sterility: assess the presence of any microbial contamination such as human transmissible bacteria, fungal, known and unknow viral organisms and other adventitious agent. • Safety: determine the safety of space grown stem cells usually in-vitro to assess DNA damage, chromosomal abnormalities, tumorigenicity and in-vivo to assess toxicity, cell distribution and fate. • Potency: evaluate the functional and therapeutic effectiveness of the space grown cells that align with the intended use. This usually involves the use of in-vitro 2D or 3D cell culture system and in-vivo animal models. 3–10 years Phase I safety clinical trial A small study involving 5–15 patients with the targeted condition or disease to evaluate the safety of space grown stem cells. 1–2 years Phase II efficacy clinical trial A randomized controlled study involving 30–100 patients that shows efficacy of the space grown stem cells relative to control. 2–3 years Phase III comparison to available treatment A larger study comparing space grown stem cells with the best available Earth grown stem cells. 3– 4 years Commercial licensure Review of data and issue of a commercial licensure. 1–2 years Total estimated time frame 10–21 years Open in a new tabExpanding stem cells for regenerative medicine applications is a novel therapeutic strategy for many conditions. In this paper, we discussed the innovative approaches to growing stem cells in space for potential use on Earth along with the conflicting data which exists today. The evidence available suggests that microgravity culture conditions may have substantial potential as a cell culture environment for expanding cells with improved therapeutic effects while the full underlying treatment mechanisms remain unclear. Incorporating microgravity into projects of a translational nature may lead to benefits towards patients on Earth to address important developmental and aging disorders, injuries, and diseases across different organ systems. This may bring the scientific community closer to creating promising cellular therapies for debilitating conditions, as well as uncovering pathways and mechanisms about stem cells in a unique environment like space. These results not only give important information fundamental to stem cell biology but enable the further development of LEO-based stem cell research platforms. Therefore, a broader perspective about stem cell applications is possible in space as research continues to explore the use of space for regenerative medicine.Author contributions The authors Fay Ghani and Abba C.

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Subject terms: Tumour immunology, Haematological cancer",
    "introduction": "Introduction Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a first line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transformation, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones, without the need for prior sensitization, before they can proliferate and give rise to disease1. In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis. During future missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), such as those NASA and other space agencies are planning to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and Mars, astronauts will be exposed to a complex ionizing radiation (IR) environment, consisting of solar energetic particles (SEP) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) that contain high atomic number and energy (HZE) charged particles. The high linear energy transfer (LET) and correspondingly higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of HZE particles will expose astronauts on exploration missions to cumulative IR doses that could increase cancer risk4–7. This possibility led NASA to identify space radiation-induced carcinogenesis as one of the top “red” risks limiting long-duration missions in deep space8,9 [https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/intro/]. While there are no documented cases of space radiation-induced cancer in astronauts who have flown in space, this is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of astronauts who have flown in space have done so aboard the ISS, which orbits at an altitude of only 254 miles above the surface of the Earth. Since the Earth’s magnetosphere, which provides a shield from space radiation8–10, extends out to a distance of roughly 37,000 miles from the Earth, astronauts board the ISS receive very minimal exposures to space radiation. While astronauts that flew the Apollo missions to the lunar surface traveled beyond this distance, these missions were very short in duration (days), and they were carefully timed to coincide with the period each month during which the Moon falls within the Earth’s 370,000 mile long magnetotail, thereby shielding these astronauts from any significant exposures. NASA and other space agencies are planning extended missions on the lunar surface, missions to near-Earth asteroids, and ultimately manned missions to Mars, all of which will place astronauts well beyond the protection of Earth’s magnetosphere for long periods of time (the current estimate for a roundtrip Mars mission is ~3 years). As such, astronauts will be exposed to significant doses11,12 of solar energetic particles (“SEP”, high energy protons) and galactic cosmic rays (“GCR”, atomic nuclei stripped of their outer electron shells), the biological impact of which is currently not well understood. Highlighting the potential for carcinogenesis as a result of exposure to the types and doses of IR to which astronauts will be exposed, we previously reported13 the induction of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mice that were repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses11,12 of 56Fe ions. This is the only report to-date of a human malignancy following exposure to space radiation. While these findings are concerning in their own right, the well documented dysregulation of multiple facets of the immune response that occurs during even short duration spaceflight14–17 suggests that accurate cancer risk assessment during future multiple-year missions in deep space will require consideration of not just the incidence of carcinogenesis arising from IR exposure, but also the fitness of the astronauts’ anti-tumor immunity. Given their key role in anti-tumor immunity, several studies have begun addressing the effect of spaceflight on the functionality of human NK cells18–26. While these studies have collectively revealed that spaceflight stressors, in particular microgravity, negatively impact NK cells, it is important to note that these studies were all conducted on Earth under conditions of normal gravity. Specifically, in the studies utilizing NK cells from crew members, cells were isolated during or immediately following spaceflight, and they were then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Similarly, in all of the in vitro studies using ground-based analogs of microgravity such as the NASA-designed Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV - Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX, USA), cytotoxicity assays were performed after culture of NK cells for a period of time in simulated microgravity, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, it is possible that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight. To better model the ability of astronauts’ NK cells to continually monitor for and eliminate any transformed cells that emerge as a result of exposure to SEP/GCR radiation, and thereby be able to accurately estimate cancer risk, we performed studies, using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight. We utilized both standard K-562 cells and T-ALL cells as targets, given our prior work demonstrating the induction of this malignancy as a result of exposure of human HSC to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions. Results obtained in conditions of continuous microgravity were then compared to those obtained with “traditional” methods in which NK cells were exposed to simulated microgravity, centrifuged, and then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Our results show that NK function is significantly more impaired when simulated microgravity conditions are maintained uninterrupted throughout the cytotoxicity assay period, suggesting prior work may have underestimated the impact microgravity exerts on these critical immune cells. Of particular note was the marked reduction in cytotoxicity against T-ALL, raising the novel and troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. These data thus highlight the need for further research to address the question of the role microgravity may play in the induction of neoplastic transformation/cancer development. RNA-seq analyses on NK cells isolated from two healthy adult human donors revealed myriad pathways that were altered by simulated microgravity, paving the way for future studies to develop targeted countermeasures to help mitigate this risk and safeguard astronaut health.",

    "results": "Results Effect of microgravity exposure on the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI cells To begin to define the impact that exposure to microgravity has upon NK cell function, we incubated NK-92MI cells for 48 h in either: (1) conditions of normal gravity (1 G) in a standard culture T-flask; or (2) conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) using the NASA-designed Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) system and its associated high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs). At the end of the 48 h incubation, NK-92MI cells were harvested and their cytotoxicity against two separate leukemic cell lines (K-562—erythroleukemia; MOLT-4—T-ALL) was measured using a commercially available non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (), following the manufacturer’s instructions which involved centrifugation and a 4 h co-incubation of the NK-92MI cells and leukemic cell lines under 1 G. As seen in Fig. 1, even a relatively brief (48 h) exposure of NK-92MI cells to simulated microgravity (sμG) dramatically reduced their ability to kill the erythroleukemic cell line K-562 (Fig. 1A) at all measured E:T ratios, and it significantly reduced their killing of the T-ALL cell line MOLT-4 (Fig. 1B) at higher E:T ratios. A 48 h exposure of NK-92MI cells to sμG also reduced their killing of MOLT-4 cells at the lowest measured E:T ratio of 5:1, but significance was not achieved. Fig. 1. Impact of simulated microgravity (sμG) on NK-92MI cytotoxicity. Open in a new tab NK-92MI cells were exposed to sμG in a rotating HARV for 48 h and then plated with leukemic cell lines at various concentrations and incubated in normal gravity for 4 h. Cytotoxicity against both K-562 (A) and MOLT-4 (B) cell lines was reduced at all E:T ratios. n=3 (K-562) or n=4 (MOLT-4). Effect of microgravity exposure on the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells While the NK-92MI cell line is a workhorse of the NK field, and it has been used in countless studies related to NK function and NK cytotoxicity against various tumors, it is an IL-2-independent permanent cell line, and as such its biology likely differs, at least in subtle ways, from that of primary NK cells. We, therefore, next performed identical studies using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of three different healthy adult human donors (volunteers were all males between 25–35 years of age; blood was collected by a physician following informed consent, in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences) to assess whether a 48 h exposure to sμG would also impair the cytotoxic function of primary human NK cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells from all (n = 3) healthy donors was also significantly reduced against K-562 (Fig. 2A, p ≤ 0.01) and MOLT-4 (Fig. 2B, p ≤ 0.05) leukemic cell lines (E:T ratio = 10:1) following a 48 h exposure to sμG, although the reduction in cytotoxicity was more pronounced against the K-562 line. Fig. 2. Impact of sμG on cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells. Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. NK cells were then harvested, plated with K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines at a 10:1 ratio, and incubated in normal gravity for 4 h. Cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced by a 48 h exposure to sμG. No significant differences were observed between tissue flasks and HARVs under normal gravity. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown. Effect of continuous microgravity on the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells For the initial studies on NK-92MI and primary human NK cells, we followed a standard protocol for measuring cytotoxicity in which NK cells were exposed to sμG for 48 h, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, we reasoned that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of the impact microgravity would have on NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight. Therefore, we next performed studies using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight and generate data that are essential for more precise astronaut cancer risk estimates. Results from the cytotoxicity assay performed in continuous sμG are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen in this Figure, subjecting primary human NK cells to conditions of sμG for 48 h and then performing the entire cytotoxicity assay under continuous conditions of sμG significantly (p ≤ 0.01) reduced their cytotoxicity towards both K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells towards both leukemic cell lines was nearly identical whether the NK cell were cultured under normal gravity in standard T-flasks (1 G Flask) or in stationary horizontal HARVs (1 G HARV), suggesting the culture vessel’s material and geometry had no appreciable effect on NK cytotoxicity. Fig. 3. Impact of continuous sμG during cytotoxicity assay on NK killing. Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. K-562 or MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines were then added at a 10:1 ratio to the vessel in which the NK cells were growing and incubated for an additional 4 h, either under 1 G (flask and horizontal stationary HARV) or under sμG (rotating HARV). Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced when the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous sμG. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown. Continuous sμG further impairs the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells beyond that of 48 h culture in sμG alone As shown in Fig. 4, when the results of the two different methodologies we employed (traditional cytotoxicity assay vs maintaining sμG throughout the entire assay procedure) regarding the impact sμG exerts on human NK cytotoxicity towards T-ALL (MOLT-4) are directly compared, it is readily apparent that maintaining sμG throughout the entire assay procedure leads to a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) further reduction in cytotoxicity relative to the traditional assay. This difference suggests that previous reports may actually have underestimated the true reduction in NK activity caused by microgravity. Importantly, our findings also indicate that NK cells at least partially regain cytotoxic function over a period of as little as 4 h when returned to normal gravity. When coupled with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice whose hematopoietic system was repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the marked reduction in cytotoxicity of NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Fig. 4. Impact on primary NK cell cytotoxicity of continuous sμG during cytotoxicity assay vs only a 48 h exposure to sμG. Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. Cytotoxicity against the K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines (at a 10:1) ratio was then assessed under standard 1 G conditions or under conditions of continued sμG to enable comparison of the impact preexposure vs continuous exposure to sμG had on primary human NK cell function. Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly further reduced when NK cells were pre-exposed for 48 h to sμG and the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous sμG compared to 48 h pre-exposure alone. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.Interestingly, the cytotoxicity towards K-562 cells did not differ significantly between the two assays (data not shown). The reasons for are not clear but could be a result of K-562 cells exhibiting reduced expression of HLA class I and heightened expression of multiple ligands for activating NK receptors, which makes them exceptionally susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity31,32. As such, even the continuous presence of conditions of sμG throughout the entire assay procedure is not able to further abrogate the ability of NK cells to recognize and kill this optimized target cell line beyond the roughly 65% inhibition resulting from the 48 h of pre-incubation in conditions of sμG. RNA-seq to delineate mechanism(s) whereby sμG reduces NK cytotoxicity To gain insight into the mechanisms by which exposure to sμG reduces the ability of primary human NK cells to recognize and lyse hematological tumors, we performed RNA-seq analysis on RNA isolated from the NK cells of 2 healthy human donors (these are 2 additional healthy donors, i.e., they are not derived from the group of 3 healthy donors whose NK cells were used for the preceding cytotoxicity studies) following 48 h of culture under conditions of sμG. For these studies, the NK cells were grown in the absence of tumor targets, as there was no way to separate the NK cells from the tumor targets for RNA isolation that would not have required centrifugation or other extensive manipulations that had the potential to alter the NK cell transcriptome. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the NK cells from the two different donors clustered together as a function of whether they were cultured in normal gravity (1 G) or sμG by both PCA (Fig. 5A) and heatmap (Fig. 5B), and the expression levels of 2184 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) up- or down-regulated by ≥1.5-fold as a result of culture in sμG, as shown in the Volcano plot in Fig. 5C.

RNA was then isolated and subjected to RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between these two gravitational conditions.

C Volcano plot of the transcriptome of the NK cells from the two donors when cultured under sμG or 1 G.Looking at specific examples of genes whose transcripts were differentially regulated by exposure to sμG, expression of various CD1 isoforms has been shown to inhibit NK cell-mediated killing33,34. In these prior studies, the CD1 isoforms to be tested were expressed on the target cells; however, our data show (Fig. 6) that culture in sμG leads to a marked induction of mRNA for CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e in the NK cells themselves (p = 2.21e−3, 8.43e−3, 7.79e−3, and 1.87e−3, respectively). Exposure to sμG also led to a significant up-regulation of the following transcripts (Fig. 7): (1) CD3D (p = 1.14e−3), which is consistent with the recently described NK2.4 subset of memory-like NK cells that accumulates with aging and exhibits low expression of the TCR complex35; (2) CD5 (p = 6.6e−3), a cell surface protein that has an inhibitory function in antigen receptor signaling and is not normally expressed on NK cells and would be expected to impair NK functionality36–38; (3) decay-accelerating factor/CD55 (p = 8.53e−3), a molecule whose expression has been shown to inhibit human NK cell cytotoxicity against hematological cancers39; (4) CD84 (p = 0.01), engagement of which significantly dampens NK cell cytotoxicity40; (5) CD200 (p = 0.02), the shedding of which in the tumor microenvironment leads to NK cell dysfunction and apoptosis41; (6) CD47 (p = 0.05), a finding of particular relevance to the anti-tumor function of NK cells, since prior studies have shown that CD47 may play an inhibitory role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against cancer cells42; (7) LAIR1 (p = 0.01), a potent inhibitor of NK cytotoxicity43; (8) NFATC1 (p = 0.02), a negative regulator of NK cell tumor immunosurveillance44; and (9) CD34 (p = 7.6e−3), an antigen only present on the earliest precursors of the NK lineage45, suggesting that microgravity may provoke a regression of NK cells to an immature, undifferentiated stem-like state, as has been reported with other cell types grown in microgravity46,47.

The actual Log2 normalized expression values for each donor are presented in brackets above or below the corresponding box plot.Conversely, as a result of exposure to sμG the following transcripts were significantly down-regulated compared to 1 G controls (Fig. 8): (1) KLRC3/NKG2E (p = 0.01), a de facto NK activating receptor48; (2) NOTCH2NLR (p = 6e−3), a receptor in a signaling pathway that plays a substantial role in human NK cell maturation and tumor killing49; and (3) TNFRSF10C (p = 0.03), a molecule that is thought to protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis50. Collectively, the differential expression of myriad genes that are intimately involved in NK cytotoxicity/function provides multiple viable mechanistic explanations for the marked reduction we observed in NK killing under conditions of sμG. Interestingly, exposure to conditions of sμG also led to marked (p = 0.05) induction of CD8A expression in NK cells (Fig. 9). Importantly, CD8 + NK cells have been shown to suppress CD4 + T cell activation and proliferation51, suggesting that microgravity may also indirectly impact the function of the acquired immune system via its effects on NK cells.

    "discussion": "Discussion Taken together, these data demonstrate that even fairly brief exposure to conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) markedly reduces the cytotoxicity of both the NK-92MI cell lines and primary human NK cells from 3 different donors towards two different hematological tumor cell lines (K-562 and MOLT-4). Furthermore, these studies are the first report in which a cytotoxicity assay was conducted in conditions of continuous sμG, preventing any alterations to cells which may be caused by return to normal gravity or the hypergravity during centrifugation that is performed during standard cytotoxicity assays. While never addressed before in this setting, we reasoned that maintaining sμG throughout the duration of the assay is critical to accurately assess the true impact microgravity exerts on NK cell function, as even a few seconds of exposure to altered gravitational forces can dramatically affect gene expression27–30. Our observation of the further reduction in NK cell killing of MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells when cytotoxicity assays are performed under continuous sμG vs. the standard protocol validated our prediction and demonstrated that prior studies employing traditional assay protocols18–26 likely underestimated the impact of microgravity on NK function. The fact that a significant further decrease in killing was not observed in continuous sμG when K-562 cells were used as targets raises the possibility that the exclusive use of this optimized target cell line with its exquisite sensitivity to NK lysis has the potential to mask important yet subtle effects various stressors may exert on NK function and highlights the importance of including additional target cell lines in future studies. When combined with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice repopulated with human HSC that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the further reduction in cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may have the potential to increase astronaut risk of this hematological malignancy, and perhaps others, during prolonged missions beyond LEO. It is interesting to note that immunodeficient mice repopulated with human HSC do not generate robust numbers of human NK cells52 unless the mice have multiple human cytokine genes knocked-in to their genome (e.g., the so-called MISTRG mice53). As such, our observation13 of the development of human T-ALL in the NSG mice repopulated with GCR-exposed human HSC lends further support to the conclusions of our current studies implicating a role for NK function in the risk of spaceflight-induced hematological malignancies, as the deficits we observe in human NK function due to exposure to microgravity may also have been present, at least to some degree, in the “avatars” of human hematopoiesis we used in our prior studies where they could potentially have played a role in the development of T-ALL. Importantly from the standpoint of astronaut safety, RNA-seq analysis performed on primary NK cells from two different healthy human donors revealed that multiple pathways that are central to NK function are altered by exposure to sμG, paving the way for future studies to test agents designed to target these specific pathways to serve as much-needed medical countermeasures that can mitigate the microgravity-induced deficits in NK function, enabling astronaut immune systems to effectively recognize and eliminate any malignant clones that arise as a result mutations induced by exposure to space radiation.",

Abstract Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Subject terms: Tumour immunology, Haematological cancerIntroduction Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a first line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transformation, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones, without the need for prior sensitization, before they can proliferate and give rise to disease1. In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis. During future missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), such as those NASA and other space agencies are planning to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and Mars, astronauts will be exposed to a complex ionizing radiation (IR) environment, consisting of solar energetic particles (SEP) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) that contain high atomic number and energy (HZE) charged particles. The high linear energy transfer (LET) and correspondingly higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of HZE particles will expose astronauts on exploration missions to cumulative IR doses that could increase cancer risk4–7. This possibility led NASA to identify space radiation-induced carcinogenesis as one of the top “red” risks limiting long-duration missions in deep space8,9 [https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/intro/]. While there are no documented cases of space radiation-induced cancer in astronauts who have flown in space, this is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of astronauts who have flown in space have done so aboard the ISS, which orbits at an altitude of only 254 miles above the surface of the Earth. Since the Earth’s magnetosphere, which provides a shield from space radiation8–10, extends out to a distance of roughly 37,000 miles from the Earth, astronauts board the ISS receive very minimal exposures to space radiation. While astronauts that flew the Apollo missions to the lunar surface traveled beyond this distance, these missions were very short in duration (days), and they were carefully timed to coincide with the period each month during which the Moon falls within the Earth’s 370,000 mile long magnetotail, thereby shielding these astronauts from any significant exposures. NASA and other space agencies are planning extended missions on the lunar surface, missions to near-Earth asteroids, and ultimately manned missions to Mars, all of which will place astronauts well beyond the protection of Earth’s magnetosphere for long periods of time (the current estimate for a roundtrip Mars mission is ~3 years). As such, astronauts will be exposed to significant doses11,12 of solar energetic particles (“SEP”, high energy protons) and galactic cosmic rays (“GCR”, atomic nuclei stripped of their outer electron shells), the biological impact of which is currently not well understood. Highlighting the potential for carcinogenesis as a result of exposure to the types and doses of IR to which astronauts will be exposed, we previously reported13 the induction of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mice that were repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses11,12 of 56Fe ions. This is the only report to-date of a human malignancy following exposure to space radiation. While these findings are concerning in their own right, the well documented dysregulation of multiple facets of the immune response that occurs during even short duration spaceflight14–17 suggests that accurate cancer risk assessment during future multiple-year missions in deep space will require consideration of not just the incidence of carcinogenesis arising from IR exposure, but also the fitness of the astronauts’ anti-tumor immunity. Given their key role in anti-tumor immunity, several studies have begun addressing the effect of spaceflight on the functionality of human NK cells18–26. While these studies have collectively revealed that spaceflight stressors, in particular microgravity, negatively impact NK cells, it is important to note that these studies were all conducted on Earth under conditions of normal gravity. Specifically, in the studies utilizing NK cells from crew members, cells were isolated during or immediately following spaceflight, and they were then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Similarly, in all of the in vitro studies using ground-based analogs of microgravity such as the NASA-designed Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV - Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX, USA), cytotoxicity assays were performed after culture of NK cells for a period of time in simulated microgravity, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, it is possible that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight. To better model the ability of astronauts’ NK cells to continually monitor for and eliminate any transformed cells that emerge as a result of exposure to SEP/GCR radiation, and thereby be able to accurately estimate cancer risk, we performed studies, using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight. We utilized both standard K-562 cells and T-ALL cells as targets, given our prior work demonstrating the induction of this malignancy as a result of exposure of human HSC to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions. Results obtained in conditions of continuous microgravity were then compared to those obtained with “traditional” methods in which NK cells were exposed to simulated microgravity, centrifuged, and then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Our results show that NK function is significantly more impaired when simulated microgravity conditions are maintained uninterrupted throughout the cytotoxicity assay period, suggesting prior work may have underestimated the impact microgravity exerts on these critical immune cells. Of particular note was the marked reduction in cytotoxicity against T-ALL, raising the novel and troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. These data thus highlight the need for further research to address the question of the role microgravity may play in the induction of neoplastic transformation/cancer development. RNA-seq analyses on NK cells isolated from two healthy adult human donors revealed myriad pathways that were altered by simulated microgravity, paving the way for future studies to develop targeted countermeasures to help mitigate this risk and safeguard astronaut health.Results Effect of microgravity exposure on the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI cells To begin to define the impact that exposure to microgravity has upon NK cell function, we incubated NK-92MI cells for 48 h in either: (1) conditions of normal gravity (1 G) in a standard culture T-flask; or (2) conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) using the NASA-designed Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) system and its associated high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs). At the end of the 48 h incubation, NK-92MI cells were harvested and their cytotoxicity against two separate leukemic cell lines (K-562—erythroleukemia; MOLT-4—T-ALL) was measured using a commercially available non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (), following the manufacturer’s instructions which involved centrifugation and a 4 h co-incubation of the NK-92MI cells and leukemic cell lines under 1 G. As seen in Fig. 1, even a relatively brief (48 h) exposure of NK-92MI cells to simulated microgravity (sμG) dramatically reduced their ability to kill the erythroleukemic cell line K-562 (Fig. 1A) at all measured E:T ratios, and it significantly reduced their killing of the T-ALL cell line MOLT-4 (Fig. 1B) at higher E:T ratios. A 48 h exposure of NK-92MI cells to sμG also reduced their killing of MOLT-4 cells at the lowest measured E:T ratio of 5:1, but significance was not achieved. Fig. 1. Impact of simulated microgravity (sμG) on NK-92MI cytotoxicity. Open in a new tab NK-92MI cells were exposed to sμG in a rotating HARV for 48 h and then plated with leukemic cell lines at various concentrations and incubated in normal gravity for 4 h. Cytotoxicity against both K-562 (A) and MOLT-4 (B) cell lines was reduced at all E:T ratios. n=3 (K-562) or n=4 (MOLT-4).Effect of microgravity exposure on the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells While the NK-92MI cell line is a workhorse of the NK field, and it has been used in countless studies related to NK function and NK cytotoxicity against various tumors, it is an IL-2-independent permanent cell line, and as such its biology likely differs, at least in subtle ways, from that of primary NK cells. We, therefore, next performed identical studies using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of three different healthy adult human donors (volunteers were all males between 25–35 years of age; blood was collected by a physician following informed consent, in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences) to assess whether a 48 h exposure to sμG would also impair the cytotoxic function of primary human NK cells. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells from all (n = 3) healthy donors was also significantly reduced against K-562 (Fig. 2A, p ≤ 0.01) and MOLT-4 (Fig. 2B, p ≤ 0.05) leukemic cell lines (E:T ratio = 10:1) following a 48 h exposure to sμG, although the reduction in cytotoxicity was more pronounced against the K-562 line. Fig. 2. Impact of sμG on cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells. Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. NK cells were then harvested, plated with K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines at a 10:1 ratio, and incubated in normal gravity for 4 h. Cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced by a 48 h exposure to sμG. No significant differences were observed between tissue flasks and HARVs under normal gravity. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.Effect of continuous microgravity on the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells For the initial studies on NK-92MI and primary human NK cells, we followed a standard protocol for measuring cytotoxicity in which NK cells were exposed to sμG for 48 h, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, we reasoned that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of the impact microgravity would have on NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight. Therefore, we next performed studies using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight and generate data that are essential for more precise astronaut cancer risk estimates. Results from the cytotoxicity assay performed in continuous sμG are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen in this Figure, subjecting primary human NK cells to conditions of sμG for 48 h and then performing the entire cytotoxicity assay under continuous conditions of sμG significantly (p ≤ 0.01) reduced their cytotoxicity towards both K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells towards both leukemic cell lines was nearly identical whether the NK cell were cultured under normal gravity in standard T-flasks (1 G Flask) or in stationary horizontal HARVs (1 G HARV), suggesting the culture vessel’s material and geometry had no appreciable effect on NK cytotoxicity.

Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. K-562 or MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines were then added at a 10:1 ratio to the vessel in which the NK cells were growing and incubated for an additional 4 h, either under 1 G (flask and horizontal stationary HARV) or under sμG (rotating HARV). Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced when the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous sμG. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.Continuous sμG further impairs the cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells beyond that of 48 h culture in sμG alone As shown in Fig. 4, when the results of the two different methodologies we employed (traditional cytotoxicity assay vs maintaining sμG throughout the entire assay procedure) regarding the impact sμG exerts on human NK cytotoxicity towards T-ALL (MOLT-4) are directly compared, it is readily apparent that maintaining sμG throughout the entire assay procedure leads to a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) further reduction in cytotoxicity relative to the traditional assay. This difference suggests that previous reports may actually have underestimated the true reduction in NK activity caused by microgravity. Importantly, our findings also indicate that NK cells at least partially regain cytotoxic function over a period of as little as 4 h when returned to normal gravity. When coupled with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice whose hematopoietic system was repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the marked reduction in cytotoxicity of NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Fig. 4. Impact on primary NK cell cytotoxicity of continuous sμG during cytotoxicity assay vs only a 48 h exposure to sμG. Open in a new tab Primary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48 h to: (1) normal gravity (1 G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1 G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) sμG in a rotating HARV. Cytotoxicity against the K-562 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines (at a 10:1) ratio was then assessed under standard 1 G conditions or under conditions of continued sμG to enable comparison of the impact preexposure vs continuous exposure to sμG had on primary human NK cell function. Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly further reduced when NK cells were pre-exposed for 48 h to sμG and the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous sμG compared to 48 h pre-exposure alone. n = 2 separate healthy donors for K-562 and n = 3 separate healthy donors for MOLT-4; combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.Interestingly, the cytotoxicity towards K-562 cells did not differ significantly between the two assays (data not shown). The reasons for are not clear but could be a result of K-562 cells exhibiting reduced expression of HLA class I and heightened expression of multiple ligands for activating NK receptors, which makes them exceptionally susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity31,32. As such, even the continuous presence of conditions of sμG throughout the entire assay procedure is not able to further abrogate the ability of NK cells to recognize and kill this optimized target cell line beyond the roughly 65% inhibition resulting from the 48 h of pre-incubation in conditions of sμG.RNA-seq to delineate mechanism(s) whereby sμG reduces NK cytotoxicity To gain insight into the mechanisms by which exposure to sμG reduces the ability of primary human NK cells to recognize and lyse hematological tumors, we performed RNA-seq analysis on RNA isolated from the NK cells of 2 healthy human donors (these are 2 additional healthy donors, i.e., they are not derived from the group of 3 healthy donors whose NK cells were used for the preceding cytotoxicity studies) following 48 h of culture under conditions of sμG. For these studies, the NK cells were grown in the absence of tumor targets, as there was no way to separate the NK cells from the tumor targets for RNA isolation that would not have required centrifugation or other extensive manipulations that had the potential to alter the NK cell transcriptome. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the NK cells from the two different donors clustered together as a function of whether they were cultured in normal gravity (1 G) or sμG by both PCA (Fig. 5A) and heatmap (Fig. 5B), and the expression levels of 2184 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) up- or down-regulated by ≥1.5-fold as a result of culture in sμG, as shown in the Volcano plot in Fig. 5C.

RNA was then isolated and subjected to RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between these two gravitational conditions.

C Volcano plot of the transcriptome of the NK cells from the two donors when cultured under sμG or 1 G.Looking at specific examples of genes whose transcripts were differentially regulated by exposure to sμG, expression of various CD1 isoforms has been shown to inhibit NK cell-mediated killing33,34. In these prior studies, the CD1 isoforms to be tested were expressed on the target cells; however, our data show (Fig. 6) that culture in sμG leads to a marked induction of mRNA for CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e in the NK cells themselves (p = 2.21e−3, 8.43e−3, 7.79e−3, and 1.87e−3, respectively). Exposure to sμG also led to a significant up-regulation of the following transcripts (Fig. 7): (1) CD3D (p = 1.14e−3), which is consistent with the recently described NK2.4 subset of memory-like NK cells that accumulates with aging and exhibits low expression of the TCR complex35; (2) CD5 (p = 6.6e−3), a cell surface protein that has an inhibitory function in antigen receptor signaling and is not normally expressed on NK cells and would be expected to impair NK functionality36–38; (3) decay-accelerating factor/CD55 (p = 8.53e−3), a molecule whose expression has been shown to inhibit human NK cell cytotoxicity against hematological cancers39; (4) CD84 (p = 0.01), engagement of which significantly dampens NK cell cytotoxicity40; (5) CD200 (p = 0.02), the shedding of which in the tumor microenvironment leads to NK cell dysfunction and apoptosis41; (6) CD47 (p = 0.05), a finding of particular relevance to the anti-tumor function of NK cells, since prior studies have shown that CD47 may play an inhibitory role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against cancer cells42; (7) LAIR1 (p = 0.01), a potent inhibitor of NK cytotoxicity43; (8) NFATC1 (p = 0.02), a negative regulator of NK cell tumor immunosurveillance44; and (9) CD34 (p = 7.6e−3), an antigen only present on the earliest precursors of the NK lineage45, suggesting that microgravity may provoke a regression of NK cells to an immature, undifferentiated stem-like state, as has been reported with other cell types grown in microgravity46,47.

The actual Log2 normalized expression values for each donor are presented in brackets above or below the corresponding box plot.Conversely, as a result of exposure to sμG the following transcripts were significantly down-regulated compared to 1 G controls (Fig. 8): (1) KLRC3/NKG2E (p = 0.01), a de facto NK activating receptor48; (2) NOTCH2NLR (p = 6e−3), a receptor in a signaling pathway that plays a substantial role in human NK cell maturation and tumor killing49; and (3) TNFRSF10C (p = 0.03), a molecule that is thought to protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis50. Collectively, the differential expression of myriad genes that are intimately involved in NK cytotoxicity/function provides multiple viable mechanistic explanations for the marked reduction we observed in NK killing under conditions of sμG. Interestingly, exposure to conditions of sμG also led to marked (p = 0.05) induction of CD8A expression in NK cells (Fig. 9). Importantly, CD8 + NK cells have been shown to suppress CD4 + T cell activation and proliferation51, suggesting that microgravity may also indirectly impact the function of the acquired immune system via its effects on NK cells.

Furthermore, these studies are the first report in which a cytotoxicity assay was conducted in conditions of continuous sμG, preventing any alterations to cells which may be caused by return to normal gravity or the hypergravity during centrifugation that is performed during standard cytotoxicity assays. While never addressed before in this setting, we reasoned that maintaining sμG throughout the duration of the assay is critical to accurately assess the true impact microgravity exerts on NK cell function, as even a few seconds of exposure to altered gravitational forces can dramatically affect gene expression27–30. Our observation of the further reduction in NK cell killing of MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells when cytotoxicity assays are performed under continuous sμG vs. the standard protocol validated our prediction and demonstrated that prior studies employing traditional assay protocols18–26 likely underestimated the impact of microgravity on NK function. The fact that a significant further decrease in killing was not observed in continuous sμG when K-562 cells were used as targets raises the possibility that the exclusive use of this optimized target cell line with its exquisite sensitivity to NK lysis has the potential to mask important yet subtle effects various stressors may exert on NK function and highlights the importance of including additional target cell lines in future studies. When combined with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice repopulated with human HSC that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the further reduction in cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may have the potential to increase astronaut risk of this hematological malignancy, and perhaps others, during prolonged missions beyond LEO. It is interesting to note that immunodeficient mice repopulated with human HSC do not generate robust numbers of human NK cells52 unless the mice have multiple human cytokine genes knocked-in to their genome (e.g., the so-called MISTRG mice53). As such, our observation13 of the development of human T-ALL in the NSG mice repopulated with GCR-exposed human HSC lends further support to the conclusions of our current studies implicating a role for NK function in the risk of spaceflight-induced hematological malignancies, as the deficits we observe in human NK function due to exposure to microgravity may also have been present, at least to some degree, in the “avatars” of human hematopoiesis we used in our prior studies where they could potentially have played a role in the development of T-ALL. Importantly from the standpoint of astronaut safety, RNA-seq analysis performed on primary NK cells from two different healthy human donors revealed that multiple pathways that are central to NK function are altered by exposure to sμG, paving the way for future studies to test agents designed to target these specific pathways to serve as much-needed medical countermeasures that can mitigate the microgravity-induced deficits in NK function, enabling astronaut immune systems to effectively recognize and eliminate any malignant clones that arise as a result mutations induced by exposure to space radiation.Materials and methods Cell lines and tissue culture The human natural killer cell line NK-92MI (ATCC® CRL™-2408) was used for initial cytotoxicity experiments. During expansion, cells were cultured in standard tissue culture flasks in Alpha Minimum Essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides but with 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate. Additional components included: 0.2 mM inositol; 0.1 mM 2mercaptoethanol; 0.02 mM folic acid; horse serum to a final concentration of 12.5%; fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 12.5% (This medium formulation will be referred to as “NK medium” from here forward). T-ALL cell line MOLT-4 (ATCC® CRL1582™) and Erythroleukemic cell line K-562 (ATCC® CCL243™) were used as target cells. All cell lines used for the present studies were tested and confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative using the MycoStrip™ Mycoplasma detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (InvivoGen US, San Diego, CA, USA). During culture and expansion, these cells were grown in RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS and IMDM + 10% FBS respectively. All cytotoxicity experiments, however, were conducted in complete NK medium, regardless of cell type. Following the initial studies with the NK-92MI cell line, subsequent cytotoxicity experiments and RNA-seq studies were performed using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors (n = 3 donors for cytotoxicity studies and n = 2 additional donors for RNA-seq studies; in all cases, donors were males 25–35 years of age; blood was collected by a physician in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences). In short, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 20 mL of whole blood using HistopaqueTM-1077 (Sigma Diagnostics, Livonia, MI, USA). Activation and preferential expansion of NK cells was conducted using NK MACS® Medium (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA), supplemented with 5% Human AB Serum (Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC, USA) and 500 IU/mL Human Recombinant IL-2 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), using the manufacturer’s protocol. Following the course of activation and expansion in tissue culture flasks under conditions of normal gravity, NK cells were isolated using a commercially available human NK Cell Isolation Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (MACS—Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated human NK cells were placed back into NK expansion media and immediately used for cytotoxicity assays, as detailed below. Cell density and viability of all cell types were assessed by manual counting of Trypan Blue-stained aliquots of each population on a hemacytometer.Microgravity incubation and standard cytotoxicity assay NK-92MI cells or primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were cultured in simulated microgravity using Synthecon’s Rotating Cell Culture System (RCCS) in conjunction with High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs). Initially, NK-92MI cells were cultured in microgravity for a period of 48 h. These cells were then removed, centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium and plated against 500,000 target cells at various effector to target (E:T) ratios. NK and leukemic cell lines were cocultured for a period of 4 h. The supernatants were then harvested, and cytotoxicity was measured using Promega’s CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay, which measures release of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). Controls accounting for spontaneous release of both target and effector cells, as well as media background were also performed. Cytotoxicity was measured as a percentage of absorbance after complete lysis of target cells (achieved with the addition of 2% Triton X-100).Cytotoxicity assay in continuous microgravity To conduct an assay in which NK cells were continuously exposed to conditions of microgravity, four HARVs were used simultaneously. NK-92MI cells were cultured in simulated microgravity in two HARVs for 48 h. Without stopping rotation (and therefore maintaining the cells in freefall), the HARVs were sampled to assess cell density and viability. Leukemic cells were then added to one of the HARVs containing NK cells at an E:T ratio of 10:1. Four separate HARVs were implemented containing the following conditions. (A) NK cells and leukemic cells; (B) NK cells alone; (C) leukemic cells alone; (D) leukemic cells with the addition of 2% Triton X-100. Together, these four vessels were used to determine the cytotoxicity of NK cells against target cells as well as the spontaneous death of NK and leukemic cells individually. These values were then compared to the total lysis of target cells in D. Extreme consideration was taken in order to ensure all cell concentrations and media were identical. All experiments were also conducted in both standard tissue culture flasks and stationery HARVs in normal gravity to account for any differences in materials. Initial experiments were attempted using HARVs rotating horizontally to account for vibrations and shear stress caused by the motion of rotation, but viability of NK cells after 48 h of culture in this fashion was so low it prevented cytotoxicity assays from being performed. Additionally, the rationale of using this condition as a control is questionable given that the shear stress experienced by these cells is significantly higher than those in freefall during vertical rotation. Lastly, horizontal rotation results in a centrifugal force vector, causing the cells within the vessel to migrate to the edges. Effectively, this phenomenon would artificially increase cell density at these locations, mostly likely resulting in inaccurate measurements of cytotoxicity.RNA sequencing PBMCs were isolated from whole blood, and NK cells were then immediately isolated from PBMCs using the methods described above. Isolated NK cells were directly suspended in NK MACS® Medium and transferred to HARVs under conditions of normal and simulated microgravity for 24 h, after which RNA was immediately isolated from each cell population using the RNeasy plus kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Germantown MD, USA). cDNA libraries were then prepared from 50 ng of each RNA extract using a NEXTFLEX® Combo-Seq™ mRNA/miRNA Kit (PerkinElmer®, Waltham, MA, USA). Libraries were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche Sequencing and Life Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), with average fragment length determined by a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were normalized prior to pooling, and the pooled libraries were sequenced using an Illumina® NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina®, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), generating 76-bp single-end reads.Sequence analysis Raw sequence reads were imported into Partek® Flow® software (Partek®, St. Louis, MO, USA) for analysis. Cutadapt54 was used to trim the random barcode (4 bases) from the 5’ end and adapter (AAAAAAAAAA) from the 3’ end of the reads. Bases with a Phred quality score <20 were trimmed, and reads <15 bases in length were discarded. High-quality reads were then aligned and quantified to the hg38 GENCODE reference database using STAR55 and an expectation/maximization (E/M) algorithm similar to the one in Xing et al.56, respectively. Transcript-level counts were summed to gene level, normalized with the median-of-ratios method used in DESeq257 and log2-transformed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess global patterns of expression across exposures.RNA-seq data analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed using ROSALIND® (https://rosalind.bio/), with a HyperScale architecture developed by ROSALIND, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). The Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value (Padj)58 and log2 fold change (LFC) was calculated for each gene. A Padj cutoff of 1e-10 was used to eliminate background in each analysis, and the entire gene dataset was used as the reference set for analysis to control for bias. Read Distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heatmaps, and sample MDS plots were generated as part of the QC step. The limma R library59 was used to calculate fold changes and p-values and perform optional covariate correction. Clustering of genes for the final heatmap of differentially expressed genes was done using the PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) method using the fpc R library60 that takes into consideration the direction and type of all signals on a pathway, the position, role and type of every gene, etc. Hypergeometric distribution was used to analyze the enrichment of pathways, gene ontology, domain structure, and other ontologies. The topGO R library61, was used to determine local similarities and dependencies between GO terms in order to perform Elim pruning correction. Several database sources were referenced for enrichment analysis, including Interpro62, 63, MSigDB64,65, REACTOME66, and WikiPathways67. Enrichment was calculated relative to a set of background genes relevant for the experiment.RNA sequencing data availability The transcriptomic dataset generated for this study is available in ’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and is accessible through GEO Series Accession Number 255750.Statistical methods All experiments detailed herein were repeated a minimum of three times to ensure rigor and reproducibility of the data.

    "abstract": "Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2 levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+ signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19]. Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female and male Long–Evans rats (Taconic) were selected for this study. Animals were group-housed in standard vivarium cages until the onset of HU. A group of females and males (referred to as “young”) underwent HU at three months of age, while a group of retired male breeders (referred to as “older males”) began HU at nine months of age. Normally loaded (NL) controls were individually housed in standard vivarium cages. Animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously [11]. NL controls were handled the same way as the HU animals except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. HU was conducted for either 14 days or 90 days. A subset of nine-month-old (older) males that underwent HU for 90 days were then released from the suspension apparatus to reambulate normally (Reloading, Rel) for 90 days. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. Enrichment consisted of Diamond Twists paper sticks (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and I-Chews (Newco, Hayward, CA, USA) and replenished as needed. Room temperature was maintained within a range of 20–26 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. After the designated duration of HU, animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose followed by exsanguination and decapitation. Tissues were collected shortly thereafter. Hearts were bisected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Refer to Table S1 for the sample sizes of the experiment groups included in this study. Young male and female, 90 day HU, and recovery groups were not included in the study either due to insufficient sample sizes or unavailability of appropriately processed samples. 2.2. Processing of Frozen Heart Samples Frozen hearts were retrieved from −80 °C storage and placed on a metal platform that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Left ventricular tissue was excised from the anterior to posterior ends (apex) of the heart. The excised left ventricular tissue was further cut into thirds (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior and posterior thirds were processed for DNA and RNA extraction, respectively. Samples were excluded from analyses if anatomical landmarks could not be conclusively identified for isolation of left ventricular tissue. 2.3. RNA Extraction from Cardiac Tissue Total RNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and purity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples showing an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 were used for RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). 2.4. cDNA Synthesis and qPCR First-strand DNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows. A total of 450 ng of RNA was used for a 30 uL first strand synthesis. Briefly, 1.5 uL of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# N8080127), 1.5 μL dNTPs (Qiagen, Cat# 1005631), and 12 μL of water were mixed, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. A solution-containing 3 μL RNase-free water, 6 μL 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Cat# Y02321), 3 μL DTT (Invitrogen, Cat# Y00147), and 1.5 μL RNase Out (Invitrogen, Cat# 100000840) was added to the abovementioned mix and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Then 1.5 μL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 28025013) was added to the resulting solution and incubated as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. All incubation steps were performed using a TC-312 thermocycler (Techne, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). First-strand DNA was stored at −80 °C until use for qPCR using the Taqman system. Multiplex PCR reactions were set up to measure both genes of interest and housekeeping gene expression in the same well of a 384-well plate. A premade gene expression master mix (Taqman, LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 4369016) was utilized, and each reaction was completed in duplicate. FAM-labeled Taqman probes (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the following genes of interest: nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2, Rn00582415_m1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, Rn00566938_m1), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2, Rn00690588_g1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, Rn01428096_m1). VIC-labeled ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19, Rn00821265_g1) was used as housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression levels for HU groups relative to age- and sex-matched controls were determined by the ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change. 2.5. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) Assay Total DNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of 8-OHdG was performed using OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# STA-320) following manufacturer’s specifications. Enzyme reaction/absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Softmax Pro 5 software. 2.6. RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Poly(A)+-enriched cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) instrument to generate 75 bp single-end reads. Sequencing data quality was checked using FastQC (version 0.11.5) software. Subsequently, reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using STAR (version 2.6.0c). Then, a matrix of read counts per gene was generated using “featureCounts” from the Rsubread package (version 1.30.5). Genes with low expression values were filtered from downstream analysis by requiring more than 5 reads in at least 6 samples for each gene. Subsequently, between-sample normalization was performed using EDASeq (version 2.16.0). One sample from each group had to be excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Hence, 6 samples per group were used for the succeeding analysis. RUVseq (version 1.16.0) [RUVs with k = 4] was used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. Genes differentially expressed between HU and control samples were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2), controlling for factors of unwanted variation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and heat maps generated using Morpheus, with Pearson method selected [20]. RStudio analysis software (Version 1.1.419), together with ggplot2 (version 3.1.1), ggrepel (version 0.8.0), and Bioconductor (DESeq2 version 1.22.2) packages, were used to obtain principal component analysis plots. For gene enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes meeting a log2 fold change cut-off of >0.3 or <−0.3 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were input into Toppfun [21,22]. Toppfun was used to assess functional enrichment of DEGs based on ontologies, gene family, phenotype (human disease), and pharmacome (drug–gene associations). Of the 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 121 matched the contents of the Toppfun database and were therefore included in the list for gene enrichment analysis. The DEGs that had no match in the Toppfun database were Clec4a1, Lilrb3l, Fcna, and Mill1. Gene enrichment analysis was performed at a false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg) of <0.05 and a gene limit of 2 or greater. GO Terms were plotted for visualization using the matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas packages run in Google Colaboratory (Python ver 3.10). 2.7. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. Once equal variance was confirmed, a t-test was performed to compare HU and matched control groups. This study involved an extended sampling period (3 years). To minimize batch effects, we compared HU and the matched controls for any given sex and timepoint since these groups were collected within the same period. Specifically, any HU group and its normally loaded control group (e.g., young male 14 day HU and NL groups) were euthanized on the same day or a day apart. Comparisons were not made across timepoints, sexes, or ages. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data shown are mean +/− S.D.",

With the exception of the 14-day HU young females, all HU groups had lower body weights versus age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1), consistent with previous reports [23,24,25]. Weight loss in HU groups of older males was transient, with body weights of NL and HU groups being comparable after 90 days of reambulation. Due to the modest decrease in body weight (10–13%), we do not expect weight loss to be a major confounding factor in other experimental outcomes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Body weights of animals included in this study. NL: normally loaded; HU: hindlimb unloading; Rel: reambulated (reloading). The HU group was compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test. To determine whether simulated microgravity leads to alterations in redox balance in cardiac tissue, we measured levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in left ventricular tissue (Figure 2). 8-OHdG is a marker for oxidative damage to DNA. Young females after 14 days of HU displayed a modest yet statistically significant increase in 8-OHdG levels (33.2%) compared to age- and sex-matched controls. At 14 days of HU, no differences were observed between HU and control groups in young and older males. Older males at 90 days of HU did not exhibit any significant difference in 8-OHdG levels versus corresponding controls. We further hypothesized that reloading will lead to increased oxidative damage to hearts due to altered fluid distribution and increased functional demand on the heart. Hence, we examined 8-OHdG levels at an earlier timepoint of reambulation (7 days) where we found no differences in 8-OHdG levels in older males that underwent normal reambulation after 90 days of HU relative to controls. Figure 2. Open in a new tab 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in left ventricular tissue as measured by ELISA. NL: normally loaded control, HU: hindlimb unloading, 7D Rel: 90D HU + 7D reloading and normally loaded control (NL). The HU groups were compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test. To further assess any changes in key molecular determinants of redox balance, we measured gene expression levels of select antioxidant genes (Sod1 and Sod2) as well as a master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response, Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A–C). In addition, we examined the gene expression of Sirt1, a marker of cellular senescence and oxidative stress also known to impact longevity [26,27] (Figure 3D). Compared to sex- and age-matched controls, young females that underwent 14 days of HU did not show any changes in gene expression for any of the four genes tested. Young males at the same timepoint showed a modest downregulation of Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A) as well as upregulation of Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 3B and 3C respectively), but no change in Sirt1 expression (Figure 3D). In older males, Nfe2l2 was downregulated at 14 days of HU, while there were no changes in Sod1, Sod2, or Sirt1 expression. The downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression in older males persisted at 90 days of HU. After a 90-day reambulation period, this pattern was reversed, with HU groups showing upregulated expression of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 relative to controls. Figure 3.

Sample sizes: N = 3–7/group. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test by comparing HU with age- and sex-matched NL control. We reasoned that identifying the molecular signature of the early adaptation of cardiac tissue to HU will allow us to link early changes in gene expression and biological pathways to later cardiac outcomes. We therefore conducted transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) of tissue from the left ventricle in older (nine-month-old) males and their corresponding controls. We selected nine-month-old males for analysis (samples were not available for females of similar age) over the other three-month-old groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering generally indicated clustering by treatment group (Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively). A total of 125 genes were differentially expressed in the HU group relative to controls. Of these, 48 were upregulated and 77 were downregulated (Table 1). The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes included a number of immune-related genes such as Tlr8 and the macrophage/monocyte markers CD68 and CD163 as well as two circadian clock-related genes, Per3 and Arntl (Figure 6). Fifteen of these DEG’s were cluster-of-differentiation (CD) molecules belonging to the C-type lectin domain family, while 6 were LY6/PLAUR domain-containing members of the complement gene family (Table 2). Nfe2l2 did not appear as a downregulated gene in the 14D HU hearts of older males based on RNAseq despite the observed decrease (although modest) in transcript levels by qPCR analysis (Figure 3A, Table 1). This is likely due to differences in the normalization methods for the two assays. Figure 4.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The objective of this study was to determine the impact of simulated microgravity on redox signaling in the heart and the overall transcriptomic landscape. Our findings from a rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model for cephalad fluid shift and microgravity exposure suggest sex and age differences in oxidative stress responses. Young males displayed upregulation in the expression of the antioxidants Sod1 and Sod2, and a decrease in Nfe2l2 expression, with no changes in 8-OHdG levels. On the other hand, increased levels of the DNA oxidative marker 8-OHdG was observed in females that underwent 14 days of HU with no changes in the expression levels of the redox signaling-related genes examined. One interpretation of our findings is that during short-term HU, young males mitigate oxidative damage more effectively than young females. Alternatively, it is possible that the kinetics of the emergence and repair of oxidative damage are sexually dimorphic. It is also unclear whether sex differences in oxidative stress responses persist due to unavailability of samples at later timepoints. Further, short-term HU in older males does not appear to enhance oxidative damage. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward increased 8-OHdG in the older males that underwent 90 days of HU compared to controls. We cannot rule out the possibility that long-duration HU can increase oxidative damage in the hearts of older males due to the small sample size available to perform the 8-OHdG assay in these groups. At 14 days of HU, older males exhibited a downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression, while 8-OHdG levels were not different between HU and controls. The persistent downregulation of Nfe2l2 at this timepoint is consistent with the observed trend towards increased oxidative damage during prolonged HU. A 90 day reambulation period after prolonged HU of 90 days led to upregulated Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 expression. It is possible that upregulation of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms by which the heart can recover from extended durations of HU. We recognize the extended time period for the conduct of the HU experiments and varying sample sizes across groups as limitations of our study. Specifically, the interpretation of the results from the 8-OHdG and qPCR assays which were performed on multiple HU groups and their corresponding NL controls merits further study. Consistent with our findings, another group has reported that HU elicits an antioxidant response. In the hearts of 6-month-old mice, HU led to time-dependent increases in the oxidation of glutathione to glutathione disulfide, an indicator of oxidative damage [28]. Taken together, our findings and those of others support the use of antioxidant-based countermeasures for extended duration spaceflight. RNAseq results indicate that 14 days of HU in older males leads to enrichment of processes involved in the immune response, including complement activation and inflammation (Figure 7, Table S2). Complement activation, a component of innate immunity, is a mechanism by which the host defends against microbial infections. Studies in the last decade have revealed a role for the complement system in recognizing damaged host cells and coordinating with other elements of the immune response to achieve resolution to injury [29,30,31]. Dysregulated complement responses have been linked to autoimmune disease [32] as well as poor outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease [33,34,35] and related animal models [36,37]. Our results indicate upregulation of several complement genes. These include C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc, all components of the membrane attack complex, as well as C5ar1, the receptor for the complement anaphylatoxin 5a, which can stimulate immune cells in myocardial infarct models [29,36,37] (Table 1). The implication of upregulated complement response in cardiac tissue during simulated microgravity requires further study given the emerging role of the complement pathway in the development of cardiovascular disease [37,38]. Interestingly, in International Space Station (ISS) crew, elements of the complement response were found to be modestly increased within a week of return to Earth relative to pre-flight values [39]. However, the impact of actual flight on complement responses could not be evaluated, since no in-flight measures were reported in the said study. The underlying bases for the observed upregulation of complement genes in HU hearts is unclear. In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Complement activation also can occur as a response to pathogens or their constituents. Hence, another possibility that requires further study is the role of gut permeability in promoting a complement response during simulated microgravity. HU has been reported to alter the gut microbiome, cause damage to intestinal villi, and compromise the structural integrity of tight junctions [40], which can lead to gut leakiness. Indeed, HU can cause a transient release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in circulation and changes in the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes, [41] as well as an increase in circulating levels of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) [42]. Further, synthetic bacterial DNA has been shown to induce a robust inflammatory response in the heart of mice [43]. Consistent with a potential role of gut permeability, we found upregulation of CD14 in 14-day HU hearts. CD14 is a surface receptor expressed in circulating monocytes/macrophages, which binds to LPS to induce an immune response [44]. Other key genes involved in the inflammatory response were also upregulated after 14 days of HU, including CD163 and CD68. CD163 is a marker for activated macrophages. CD163+ macrophages promote angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration [45] and are increased in hearts of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys [46]. Further, CD68 marks the monocyte/macrophage population. Both expression levels of CD68 and immunopositive cell counts increase in the hearts of mice exposed to spaceflight-relevant doses (<0.5 Gy) of radiation [47]. In addition, HU in mice increased hippocampal CD68 levels, which mark activated microglial populations [48,49]. Collectively, the upregulation of CD14, CD68, and CD163 expression would be consistent with macrophage infiltration in HU hearts. Humans in future deep space missions will experience extended periods of low-dose space radiation and microgravity. Hence, the impact of the predicted upregulation of macrophage activity on human cardiovascular health requires further study. Tlr8 also was upregulated in the hearts of 14-day HU animals. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the important role of TLR signaling in the development of cardiovascular disease [50,51], whereas Tlr8 transcripts increased in patients with enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [52]. RNAseq results also suggest that HU in older males can perturb cardiac circadian clock signals. The circadian clock gene, Arntl (Bmal1), was the fourth most downregulated gene in the HU group, while Per3 was the most upregulated gene. Other circadian clock-related genes such as Per2 and Clock were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. There is a growing appreciation for the role of clock genes in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac-specific deletion of Arntl leads to congestive heart failure during aging, upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes in hearts and altered energy metabolism [53]. In addition, Per2 gene ablation worsens the inflammatory response to myocardial ischemia [54]. ISS crew experience circadian misalignment which leads to sleep–wake cycle disruption [55]. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2, Arntl, and Clock [56]. Taken together, our findings and those of others show the importance of exploring the role of circadian clock signaling in spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. RNAseq also revealed the enrichment of processes related to redox signaling, such as superoxide anion generation. Furthermore, 14 days of HU led to differential expression of a number of genes known to play a role in the defense against oxidative damage. In the current study, Clusterin (Clu), also known as Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), was upregulated after 14 days of HU. Overexpression of Clu in rat ventricular cells has been reported to rescue angiotensin II-induced ROS production and apoptosis [57]. Ucp3, a member of the family of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), was downregulated at 14 days of HU. UCPs have a number of functions, such as dissipating the proton gradient in the mitochondria, which reduces ATP production, releasing energy as heat, and also play a role in the regulation of redox balance [58]. Compared to wild-type controls, the hearts of Ucp3 knockout mice maintained in thermoneutral conditions have reduced mitochondrial complex activities as well as increased levels of ROS and oxidative stress markers [59]. Thus, the downregulation of Ucp3 in the hearts of HU rats suggests that simulated microgravity alters redox signaling and energetic processes in the mitochondria, consistent with findings from spaceflight and analog studies of other tissues [60,61]. Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (Rcan1), which is downregulated in hearts after 14 days of HU, plays a role in NFAT/Calcineurin signaling and is implicated in CVD progression [62,63]. Deletion of Rcan1 exacerbates the effects of septic cardiomyopathy and increases cardiac mitochondrial injury, as shown by elevated ROS levels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [62]. Taken together, our findings are in support of the hypothesis that simulated microgravity leads to altered redox signaling and function in the heart. In addition, these results are consistent with our earlier findings that hearts of mice that have been in space for 15 days show altered expression of genes regulating redox balance [64]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage. Therefore, our model predicts that in the absence of any mitigation strategies, extended spaceflight (>a year) may upregulate pro-inflammatory signaling in cardiac tissue. Consistent with our hypothesis, simulated microgravity led to enhanced expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Therefore, mitigating excessive inflammation and ensuring optimum antioxidant defenses (e.g., via dietary supplementation) may be a useful approach to ensure long-term cardiac health in astronauts during deep space missions. The upregulation of complement activation genes in hearts of rodents exposed to HU needs further study to determine its underlying basis and long-term consequences for cardiac health. In addition, we have identified the molecular signature of cardiac tissue responses to HU. A subset of these differentially expressed genes could be tested as candidate circulating biomarkers for monitoring the trajectory of an astronaut’s response to spaceflight or predicting the need for medical intervention.",

Copyright notice ID: 11353732 PMID: 39202335 Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, microgravity, cardiovascular system, immune response, transcriptomics1. Introduction Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2 levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+ signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19]. Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female and male Long–Evans rats (Taconic) were selected for this study. Animals were group-housed in standard vivarium cages until the onset of HU. A group of females and males (referred to as “young”) underwent HU at three months of age, while a group of retired male breeders (referred to as “older males”) began HU at nine months of age. Normally loaded (NL) controls were individually housed in standard vivarium cages. Animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously [11]. NL controls were handled the same way as the HU animals except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. HU was conducted for either 14 days or 90 days. A subset of nine-month-old (older) males that underwent HU for 90 days were then released from the suspension apparatus to reambulate normally (Reloading, Rel) for 90 days. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. Enrichment consisted of Diamond Twists paper sticks (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and I-Chews (Newco, Hayward, CA, USA) and replenished as needed. Room temperature was maintained within a range of 20–26 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. After the designated duration of HU, animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose followed by exsanguination and decapitation. Tissues were collected shortly thereafter. Hearts were bisected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Refer to Table S1 for the sample sizes of the experiment groups included in this study. Young male and female, 90 day HU, and recovery groups were not included in the study either due to insufficient sample sizes or unavailability of appropriately processed samples.2.2. Processing of Frozen Heart Samples Frozen hearts were retrieved from −80 °C storage and placed on a metal platform that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Left ventricular tissue was excised from the anterior to posterior ends (apex) of the heart. The excised left ventricular tissue was further cut into thirds (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior and posterior thirds were processed for DNA and RNA extraction, respectively. Samples were excluded from analyses if anatomical landmarks could not be conclusively identified for isolation of left ventricular tissue.2.3. RNA Extraction from Cardiac Tissue Total RNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and purity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples showing an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 were used for RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).2.4. cDNA Synthesis and qPCR First-strand DNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows. A total of 450 ng of RNA was used for a 30 uL first strand synthesis. Briefly, 1.5 uL of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# N8080127), 1.5 μL dNTPs (Qiagen, Cat# 1005631), and 12 μL of water were mixed, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. A solution-containing 3 μL RNase-free water, 6 μL 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Cat# Y02321), 3 μL DTT (Invitrogen, Cat# Y00147), and 1.5 μL RNase Out (Invitrogen, Cat# 100000840) was added to the abovementioned mix and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Then 1.5 μL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 28025013) was added to the resulting solution and incubated as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. All incubation steps were performed using a TC-312 thermocycler (Techne, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). First-strand DNA was stored at −80 °C until use for qPCR using the Taqman system. Multiplex PCR reactions were set up to measure both genes of interest and housekeeping gene expression in the same well of a 384-well plate. A premade gene expression master mix (Taqman, LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 4369016) was utilized, and each reaction was completed in duplicate. FAM-labeled Taqman probes (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the following genes of interest: nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2, Rn00582415_m1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, Rn00566938_m1), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2, Rn00690588_g1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, Rn01428096_m1). VIC-labeled ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19, Rn00821265_g1) was used as housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression levels for HU groups relative to age- and sex-matched controls were determined by the ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change.2.5. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) Assay Total DNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of 8-OHdG was performed using OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# STA-320) following manufacturer’s specifications. Enzyme reaction/absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Softmax Pro 5 software.2.6. RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Poly(A)+-enriched cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) instrument to generate 75 bp single-end reads. Sequencing data quality was checked using FastQC (version 0.11.5) software. Subsequently, reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using STAR (version 2.6.0c). Then, a matrix of read counts per gene was generated using “featureCounts” from the Rsubread package (version 1.30.5). Genes with low expression values were filtered from downstream analysis by requiring more than 5 reads in at least 6 samples for each gene. Subsequently, between-sample normalization was performed using EDASeq (version 2.16.0). One sample from each group had to be excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Hence, 6 samples per group were used for the succeeding analysis. RUVseq (version 1.16.0) [RUVs with k = 4] was used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. Genes differentially expressed between HU and control samples were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2), controlling for factors of unwanted variation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and heat maps generated using Morpheus, with Pearson method selected [20]. RStudio analysis software (Version 1.1.419), together with ggplot2 (version 3.1.1), ggrepel (version 0.8.0), and Bioconductor (DESeq2 version 1.22.2) packages, were used to obtain principal component analysis plots. For gene enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes meeting a log2 fold change cut-off of >0.3 or <−0.3 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were input into Toppfun [21,22]. Toppfun was used to assess functional enrichment of DEGs based on ontologies, gene family, phenotype (human disease), and pharmacome (drug–gene associations). Of the 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 121 matched the contents of the Toppfun database and were therefore included in the list for gene enrichment analysis. The DEGs that had no match in the Toppfun database were Clec4a1, Lilrb3l, Fcna, and Mill1. Gene enrichment analysis was performed at a false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg) of <0.05 and a gene limit of 2 or greater. GO Terms were plotted for visualization using the matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas packages run in Google Colaboratory (Python ver 3.10).2.7. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. Once equal variance was confirmed, a t-test was performed to compare HU and matched control groups. This study involved an extended sampling period (3 years). To minimize batch effects, we compared HU and the matched controls for any given sex and timepoint since these groups were collected within the same period. Specifically, any HU group and its normally loaded control group (e.g., young male 14 day HU and NL groups) were euthanized on the same day or a day apart. Comparisons were not made across timepoints, sexes, or ages. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data shown are mean +/− S.D.3. Results In this study, we made use of the rodent HU model to gain insight on the effects of microgravity exposure on molecular signatures of the heart. With the exception of the 14-day HU young females, all HU groups had lower body weights versus age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1), consistent with previous reports [23,24,25]. Weight loss in HU groups of older males was transient, with body weights of NL and HU groups being comparable after 90 days of reambulation. Due to the modest decrease in body weight (10–13%), we do not expect weight loss to be a major confounding factor in other experimental outcomes. Figure 1.

The HU group was compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.To determine whether simulated microgravity leads to alterations in redox balance in cardiac tissue, we measured levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in left ventricular tissue (Figure 2). 8-OHdG is a marker for oxidative damage to DNA. Young females after 14 days of HU displayed a modest yet statistically significant increase in 8-OHdG levels (33.2%) compared to age- and sex-matched controls. At 14 days of HU, no differences were observed between HU and control groups in young and older males. Older males at 90 days of HU did not exhibit any significant difference in 8-OHdG levels versus corresponding controls. We further hypothesized that reloading will lead to increased oxidative damage to hearts due to altered fluid distribution and increased functional demand on the heart. Hence, we examined 8-OHdG levels at an earlier timepoint of reambulation (7 days) where we found no differences in 8-OHdG levels in older males that underwent normal reambulation after 90 days of HU relative to controls. Figure 2. Open in a new tab 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in left ventricular tissue as measured by ELISA. NL: normally loaded control, HU: hindlimb unloading, 7D Rel: 90D HU + 7D reloading and normally loaded control (NL). The HU groups were compared to their age- and sex-matched NL controls by Student’s t-test. Sample sizes: N = 5–8/group for all groups except for 90D older males, where N = 3. Values depicted are means and standard deviation. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.To further assess any changes in key molecular determinants of redox balance, we measured gene expression levels of select antioxidant genes (Sod1 and Sod2) as well as a master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response, Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A–C). In addition, we examined the gene expression of Sirt1, a marker of cellular senescence and oxidative stress also known to impact longevity [26,27] (Figure 3D). Compared to sex- and age-matched controls, young females that underwent 14 days of HU did not show any changes in gene expression for any of the four genes tested. Young males at the same timepoint showed a modest downregulation of Nfe2l2 (Figure 3A) as well as upregulation of Sod1 and Sod2 (Figure 3B and 3C respectively), but no change in Sirt1 expression (Figure 3D). In older males, Nfe2l2 was downregulated at 14 days of HU, while there were no changes in Sod1, Sod2, or Sirt1 expression. The downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression in older males persisted at 90 days of HU. After a 90-day reambulation period, this pattern was reversed, with HU groups showing upregulated expression of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 relative to controls. Figure 3.

NL: normally loaded control, HU: hindlimb unloading, 90D Rel: 90D HU + 90D reloading and NL control. Sample sizes: N = 3–7/group. * Significant at p < 0.05 by Student’s t-test by comparing HU with age- and sex-matched NL control.We reasoned that identifying the molecular signature of the early adaptation of cardiac tissue to HU will allow us to link early changes in gene expression and biological pathways to later cardiac outcomes. We therefore conducted transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) of tissue from the left ventricle in older (nine-month-old) males and their corresponding controls. We selected nine-month-old males for analysis (samples were not available for females of similar age) over the other three-month-old groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering generally indicated clustering by treatment group (Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively). A total of 125 genes were differentially expressed in the HU group relative to controls. Of these, 48 were upregulated and 77 were downregulated (Table 1). The top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes included a number of immune-related genes such as Tlr8 and the macrophage/monocyte markers CD68 and CD163 as well as two circadian clock-related genes, Per3 and Arntl (Figure 6). Fifteen of these DEG’s were cluster-of-differentiation (CD) molecules belonging to the C-type lectin domain family, while 6 were LY6/PLAUR domain-containing members of the complement gene family (Table 2). Nfe2l2 did not appear as a downregulated gene in the 14D HU hearts of older males based on RNAseq despite the observed decrease (although modest) in transcript levels by qPCR analysis (Figure 3A, Table 1). This is likely due to differences in the normalization methods for the two assays. Figure 4.

Discussion The objective of this study was to determine the impact of simulated microgravity on redox signaling in the heart and the overall transcriptomic landscape. Our findings from a rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model for cephalad fluid shift and microgravity exposure suggest sex and age differences in oxidative stress responses. Young males displayed upregulation in the expression of the antioxidants Sod1 and Sod2, and a decrease in Nfe2l2 expression, with no changes in 8-OHdG levels. On the other hand, increased levels of the DNA oxidative marker 8-OHdG was observed in females that underwent 14 days of HU with no changes in the expression levels of the redox signaling-related genes examined. One interpretation of our findings is that during short-term HU, young males mitigate oxidative damage more effectively than young females. Alternatively, it is possible that the kinetics of the emergence and repair of oxidative damage are sexually dimorphic. It is also unclear whether sex differences in oxidative stress responses persist due to unavailability of samples at later timepoints. Further, short-term HU in older males does not appear to enhance oxidative damage. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward increased 8-OHdG in the older males that underwent 90 days of HU compared to controls. We cannot rule out the possibility that long-duration HU can increase oxidative damage in the hearts of older males due to the small sample size available to perform the 8-OHdG assay in these groups. At 14 days of HU, older males exhibited a downregulation of Nfe2l2 expression, while 8-OHdG levels were not different between HU and controls. The persistent downregulation of Nfe2l2 at this timepoint is consistent with the observed trend towards increased oxidative damage during prolonged HU. A 90 day reambulation period after prolonged HU of 90 days led to upregulated Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 expression. It is possible that upregulation of Nfe2l2 and Sirt1 may be one of the underlying mechanisms by which the heart can recover from extended durations of HU. We recognize the extended time period for the conduct of the HU experiments and varying sample sizes across groups as limitations of our study. Specifically, the interpretation of the results from the 8-OHdG and qPCR assays which were performed on multiple HU groups and their corresponding NL controls merits further study. Consistent with our findings, another group has reported that HU elicits an antioxidant response. In the hearts of 6-month-old mice, HU led to time-dependent increases in the oxidation of glutathione to glutathione disulfide, an indicator of oxidative damage [28]. Taken together, our findings and those of others support the use of antioxidant-based countermeasures for extended duration spaceflight. RNAseq results indicate that 14 days of HU in older males leads to enrichment of processes involved in the immune response, including complement activation and inflammation (Figure 7, Table S2). Complement activation, a component of innate immunity, is a mechanism by which the host defends against microbial infections. Studies in the last decade have revealed a role for the complement system in recognizing damaged host cells and coordinating with other elements of the immune response to achieve resolution to injury [29,30,31]. Dysregulated complement responses have been linked to autoimmune disease [32] as well as poor outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease [33,34,35] and related animal models [36,37]. Our results indicate upregulation of several complement genes. These include C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc, all components of the membrane attack complex, as well as C5ar1, the receptor for the complement anaphylatoxin 5a, which can stimulate immune cells in myocardial infarct models [29,36,37] (Table 1). The implication of upregulated complement response in cardiac tissue during simulated microgravity requires further study given the emerging role of the complement pathway in the development of cardiovascular disease [37,38]. Interestingly, in International Space Station (ISS) crew, elements of the complement response were found to be modestly increased within a week of return to Earth relative to pre-flight values [39]. However, the impact of actual flight on complement responses could not be evaluated, since no in-flight measures were reported in the said study. The underlying bases for the observed upregulation of complement genes in HU hearts is unclear. In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Complement activation also can occur as a response to pathogens or their constituents. Hence, another possibility that requires further study is the role of gut permeability in promoting a complement response during simulated microgravity. HU has been reported to alter the gut microbiome, cause damage to intestinal villi, and compromise the structural integrity of tight junctions [40], which can lead to gut leakiness. Indeed, HU can cause a transient release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in circulation and changes in the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes, [41] as well as an increase in circulating levels of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) [42]. Further, synthetic bacterial DNA has been shown to induce a robust inflammatory response in the heart of mice [43]. Consistent with a potential role of gut permeability, we found upregulation of CD14 in 14-day HU hearts. CD14 is a surface receptor expressed in circulating monocytes/macrophages, which binds to LPS to induce an immune response [44]. Other key genes involved in the inflammatory response were also upregulated after 14 days of HU, including CD163 and CD68. CD163 is a marker for activated macrophages. CD163+ macrophages promote angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration [45] and are increased in hearts of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys [46]. Further, CD68 marks the monocyte/macrophage population. Both expression levels of CD68 and immunopositive cell counts increase in the hearts of mice exposed to spaceflight-relevant doses (<0.5 Gy) of radiation [47]. In addition, HU in mice increased hippocampal CD68 levels, which mark activated microglial populations [48,49]. Collectively, the upregulation of CD14, CD68, and CD163 expression would be consistent with macrophage infiltration in HU hearts. Humans in future deep space missions will experience extended periods of low-dose space radiation and microgravity. Hence, the impact of the predicted upregulation of macrophage activity on human cardiovascular health requires further study. Tlr8 also was upregulated in the hearts of 14-day HU animals. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the important role of TLR signaling in the development of cardiovascular disease [50,51], whereas Tlr8 transcripts increased in patients with enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [52]. RNAseq results also suggest that HU in older males can perturb cardiac circadian clock signals. The circadian clock gene, Arntl (Bmal1), was the fourth most downregulated gene in the HU group, while Per3 was the most upregulated gene. Other circadian clock-related genes such as Per2 and Clock were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. There is a growing appreciation for the role of clock genes in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac-specific deletion of Arntl leads to congestive heart failure during aging, upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes in hearts and altered energy metabolism [53]. In addition, Per2 gene ablation worsens the inflammatory response to myocardial ischemia [54]. ISS crew experience circadian misalignment which leads to sleep–wake cycle disruption [55]. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2, Arntl, and Clock [56]. Taken together, our findings and those of others show the importance of exploring the role of circadian clock signaling in spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. RNAseq also revealed the enrichment of processes related to redox signaling, such as superoxide anion generation. Furthermore, 14 days of HU led to differential expression of a number of genes known to play a role in the defense against oxidative damage. In the current study, Clusterin (Clu), also known as Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), was upregulated after 14 days of HU. Overexpression of Clu in rat ventricular cells has been reported to rescue angiotensin II-induced ROS production and apoptosis [57]. Ucp3, a member of the family of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), was downregulated at 14 days of HU. UCPs have a number of functions, such as dissipating the proton gradient in the mitochondria, which reduces ATP production, releasing energy as heat, and also play a role in the regulation of redox balance [58]. Compared to wild-type controls, the hearts of Ucp3 knockout mice maintained in thermoneutral conditions have reduced mitochondrial complex activities as well as increased levels of ROS and oxidative stress markers [59]. Thus, the downregulation of Ucp3 in the hearts of HU rats suggests that simulated microgravity alters redox signaling and energetic processes in the mitochondria, consistent with findings from spaceflight and analog studies of other tissues [60,61]. Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (Rcan1), which is downregulated in hearts after 14 days of HU, plays a role in NFAT/Calcineurin signaling and is implicated in CVD progression [62,63]. Deletion of Rcan1 exacerbates the effects of septic cardiomyopathy and increases cardiac mitochondrial injury, as shown by elevated ROS levels and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [62]. Taken together, our findings are in support of the hypothesis that simulated microgravity leads to altered redox signaling and function in the heart. In addition, these results are consistent with our earlier findings that hearts of mice that have been in space for 15 days show altered expression of genes regulating redox balance [64]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage. Therefore, our model predicts that in the absence of any mitigation strategies, extended spaceflight (>a year) may upregulate pro-inflammatory signaling in cardiac tissue. Consistent with our hypothesis, simulated microgravity led to enhanced expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Therefore, mitigating excessive inflammation and ensuring optimum antioxidant defenses (e.g., via dietary supplementation) may be a useful approach to ensure long-term cardiac health in astronauts during deep space missions. The upregulation of complement activation genes in hearts of rodents exposed to HU needs further study to determine its underlying basis and long-term consequences for cardiac health. In addition, we have identified the molecular signature of cardiac tissue responses to HU. A subset of these differentially expressed genes could be tested as candidate circulating biomarkers for monitoring the trajectory of an astronaut’s response to spaceflight or predicting the need for medical intervention.Acknowledgments We are grateful to April Ronca and other members of Ames SC Division for coordinating this NASA-funded tissue-sharing opportunity.

All mice were treated weekly with either BuOE (1 mg/kg) or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for the duration of spaceflight. Upon live return to Earth, soleus muscles were dissected and stored in RNALater at −80 °C. Muscles were thawed, rinsed from RNALater, and homogenized in homogenizing buffer prior to further analysis5. SERCA activity assay and ionophore ratio SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay as previously described19. Full SERCA ATPase-pCa curves were run in the presence of ionophore as well as in the absence of ionophore specifically at maximal stimulating Ca2+ concentrations (pCa = 5.0) to gain a measure of SR Ca2+ leak and permeability as previously described34–36. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 induces SR membrane permeability, which encourages maximal SERCA activity by preventing back inhibition.

Copyright notice ID: 11271499 PMID: 39030182 Abstract Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. Subject terms: Calcium channels, Physiology Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to cause extensive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially to postural muscles such as the soleus1–6. Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness precedes muscle atrophy4 and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca2+ dysregulation7. Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR) -1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca2+ uptake ability of the sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely impaired following ~1 month of spaceflight5. In muscle, SERCA is responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) by bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)8,9. Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca2+]i, leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and muscle weakness and atrophy10–14. Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly susceptible to post-translational modifications (e.g., tyrosine nitration, cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic activity 5,15–22. The ensuing elevated [Ca2+]i will not only lead to muscle damage but can also further increase RONS production23–25 creating a negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology. While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signaling molecules at low concentrations26. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for review, see ref. 27). Mice deficient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity, muscle weakness, and atrophy11,20,22; but, the pharmacological activation of SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle atrophy despite increased oxidative stress11,12. Thus, targeting SERCA, either through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic28,29, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. BuOE has been effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-induced injury30–33, a relevant injury mechanism to spaceflight, providing strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study. Following 35 days of exposure to microgravity, absolute soleus weight was significantly reduced in the flight groups compared to GC/VIV groups (p = 0.0005) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 1A). No effects of flight or treatment were observed on body weight (Fig. 1B) resulting in a main effect of flight reducing the soleus:body weight ratio (p = 0.0053, Fig. 1C). Fig. 1. Spaceflight induces soleus muscle atrophy that is not attenuated by BuOE treatment. Open in a new tab Soleus weight is significantly reduced following spaceflight (A) with no changes in body weight (B), resulting in a significant reduction of the soleus:body weight ratio in the flight groups compared to controls (C). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented above the graphs.Ionophore supported Ca2+-dependent SERCA ATPase activity was assessed across a range of [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0–5.0) and was presented as percentage of maximal activity (Fig. 2A) to assess the pCa50 (i.e., [Ca2+] required to elicit ½ maximal activity) as a measure of SERCA’s apparent affinity for Ca2+. There was no effect of spaceflight or BuOE treatment on maximal SERCA ATPase activity (Fig. 2B), but a main effect of BuOE treatment increasing SERCA’s apparent affinity for Ca2+ was detected (p = 0.0323, Fig. 2C). In dividing the maximal ATPase rates with ionophore (no Ca2+ gradient) by the rates without ionophore (Ca2+ gradient), a measure of SR Ca2+ permeability and leak can be obtained34–36. In doing this, we observed a main effect of flight reducing the ionophore ratio (p = 0.0255, Fig. 2D), indicative of increased SR Ca2+ leak. Fig. 2. BuOE increases SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ and exposure to microgravity reduces SERCA’s ionophore ratio. Open in a new tab SERCA activity-pCa curves presented as % max (A). No changes in maximal SERCA ATPase activity were detected (B); but, a main effect of BuOE increasing the pCa50 was found (C). The ionophore ratio was significantly reduced in spaceflight groups with no effect of BuOE (D). Densitometric analysis and representative western blot images show significant increases in SERCA1a and SERCA2a protein content in the space-flown soleus (E). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented above the graphs (A–D) or above bars (E).Western blotting revealed significant increases in SERCA1a (p = 0.0039) and SERCA2a (p = 0.0107) protein content in the spaceflight groups compared to GC/VIV with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 2E). Total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein, RYR, was also investigated with no effects on total RYR, but increases in p-RYR (increases Ca2+ release) in flight groups compared to GC/VIV, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0905, Fig. 2E). 4-HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation due to increased RONS and therefore serves as a marker of oxidative stress37. Significant increases in 4-HNE were observed in flight groups compared to GC/VIV (p = 0.0387) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 3A). Further, total SOD content was reduced in flight groups compared to controls, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0510, Fig. 3A). Investigating protein content of the three SERCA regulators demonstrated dynamic changes in response to spaceflight. Significant reductions in SLN (p = 0.0080), increases in NNAT (p = 0.0158), and reductions in PLN approaching statistical significance (p = 0.0828) were all observed in the space-flown soleus compared to GC/VIV (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. BuOE treatment does not attenuate increased oxidative stress following spaceflight. Open in a new tab Densitometric analysis and representative western blots show significant increases in 4-HNE following spaceflight and reductions in SOD approaching statistical significance with no effects of BuOE treatment (A). Protein content of the three SERCA regulators shows significant reductions in SLN and PLN and significant increases in NNAT following spaceflight (B). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented in bars.To extend our previous work demonstrating that soleus SERCA Ca2+ uptake is impaired following spaceflight, which we attributed to increased RONS content5, we investigated whether treatment with the antioxidant, BuOE, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction following spaceflight. We found BuOE was unable to attenuate soleus muscle atrophy following 35 days in space. While BuOE treatment increased SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ in both the GC/VIV and flight groups, it was unable to rescue the significant increases in 4-HNE content or SR Ca2+ leak, measured using an ionophore ratio, induced by microgravity exposure. Consistent with previous work5, we observed increases in protein content of both SERCA isoforms following spaceflight as well as increases in oxidative stress and dynamic changes in the expression of the three SERCA regulators, SLN, NNAT, and PLN. Spaceflight also tended to reduce SOD content and increase p-RYR, both of which may be contributing to increased SR Ca2+ leak. Past literature using both ground-based and spaceflight models in rodents and humans has begun to suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in skeletal muscle may be an early step in the pathogenesis of weakness and atrophy4,5,38. Specifically, we have previously shown the Ca2+ uptake ability of SERCA to be impaired following spaceflight which we attributed, at least partially, to increases in total protein RONS5. SERCA pumps have highly susceptible tyrosine residues that, in the presence of increased RONS, can result in tyrosine nitration15–18. Tyrosine 294 and 295 of SERCA appear to be most vulnerable to tyrosine nitration and reside in the transmembrane domain of the pump, a necessary domain for Ca2+ translocation16. The structural changes that ensue following tyrosine nitration of these residues result in impaired catalytic activity and increased [Ca2+]i. Here, we investigated ATPase activity of the SERCA pump and found no changes in response to microgravity; though, we do observe a main effect of BuOE treatment increasing SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. This is consistent with our previous work showing that heterozygous deletion of SOD2 reduces SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+20. The increases in both SERCA isoforms with spaceflight are consistent with our previous work5 and were similarly unable to attenuate spaceflight-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Given that SERCA density is the primary determinant of Ca2+ uptake39 the increased protein content should increase SERCA catalytic activity; however, this was not detected, suggesting protein dysfunction or a failed compensatory response. The mechanism underlying increased SERCA protein expression following spaceflight requires further investigation but has been observed in other muscle-wasting diseases and myopathies21,40,41. SLN and PLN act to reduce SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake through reductions in affinity as well as inducing Ca2+ slippage42–44; however, no effects of BuOE were detected on the protein expression of SLN, NNAT, or PLN with the only changes being observed with spaceflight. With regards to the SERCA regulators, inconsistencies were observed with the previous RR-9 mission where there was a clear increase in SLN and decrease in NNAT following spaceflight5; but, RR-18 shows the opposite with reductions in SLN and increases in NNAT, which is maintained even when loaded on the same gel (Supplemental Fig. 1A, B). At present, we can only speculate that possible differences in reloading time (~20 h for RR-1845 and ~38 h for RR-946) would lead to altered expression patterns, but this warrants further investigation. It has been well established that Ca2+ accumulates in the cytosol of muscle fibers following unloading7,47–51 and we also contribute to the growing literature on Ca2+ dysregulation by demonstrating that SR Ca2+ leak is significantly increased in the murine soleus following microgravity exposure, consistent with what has been reported with hindlimb suspension52. Increased SR Ca2+ leak has been observed in various muscle pathologies, many of which are related to post-translational modifications of RYR and its regulators53–56. Here, we observed increases in phosphorylated RYR, albeit non-statistically significant, that may still be contributing to increased Ca2+ leak. Notably, previous work has demonstrated that blocking L-type Ca2+ channels attenuates unloading-induced Ca2+ overload in the rat soleus57. In addition to alterations to RYR, the lipid composition of the SR membrane can also drastically alter Ca2+ handling34,58,59. More specifically, it has been shown that increased lipid peroxidation will increase membrane permeability60–62 and with significant increases in 4-HNE, a product of lipid peroxidation37, in the space-flown soleus, it is likely that alterations to SR permeability are contributing to increased Ca2+ leak, though more targeted studies are required. As well as SR Ca2+ leak, there are several other mechanisms that can lead to elevations in [Ca2+]i that were not explored in the present study. One such mechanism is early muscle membrane depolarization, due to reduced Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity63,64, possibly triggering the opening of the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors and increasing [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ overload may also be a product of store-operated Ca2+ entry - the process of Ca2+ influx triggered by reductions in SR luminal [Ca2+] (for review, see ref. 65), which could be triggered by SERCA dysfunction. This phenomenon has been identified to contribute to Ca2+ overload in dystrophic muscle66,67 and various other myopathies68, though its contributions to muscle atrophy and weakness following unloading remain to be explored. In skeletal muscle, BuOE was unable to attenuate the increases in 4-HNE caused by spaceflight; but, was effective in reducing 4-HNE in the retina from the same mice45, indicative of tissue-specific responses to BuOE at the dose provided in this study. Though speculative, it is possible that BuOE was unable to compensate for the reductions in SOD content observed following spaceflight, an effect also seen in astronaut muscle following spaceflight, albeit in hair samples69. Future studies focused on skeletal muscle, namely SERCA function in the soleus, may benefit from higher doses of BuOE treatment or other modes of cytotoxic protection. For example, HSP70 can protect SERCA from oxidant damage in conditions of muscular dystrophy70, and it would be of interest to determine whether pharmacological induction or genetic overexpression of HSP70 could protect SERCA function in the context of spaceflight. While we were limited in our ability to measure the sources of RONS in this study, previous work has demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction71,72, and increased NADPH oxidase expression and activity73,74 to contribute to RONS production with spaceflight and simulated microgravity exposure. Further investigation into whether targeting RONS production at the source can counteract muscle weakness and atrophy is needed. Regardless, targeting Ca2+ leak from the SR has shown to be beneficial to muscle health in aged mice75, hypoxia-induced atrophy in rodents76, and murine dystrophic muscle77 indicating that this may be a viable target for spaceflight-induced changes in SR permeability and leak. Importantly, a recent study by Sharlo, et al. 78 treated rats with the SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simulated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of Ca2+ homeostasis. This finding, along with others targeting SERCA activation in situations of muscle impairment11,12 demonstrate the importance of directly targeting SERCA in space. We observe some discrepancies related to SLN expression following spaceflight between the RR-95 and the present RR-18 study. SLN expression has been shown to upregulated in several muscle-wasting conditions, but whether this upregulation is beneficial or detrimental to muscle is still under debate (for review, see ref. 79). Procedurally, the RR-1, RR-9, and RR-18 studies all maintained mouse strain and housing temperature but disparities in reloading time prior to euthanasia (RR-9, ~38 h46; RR-18, ~20 h45) may contribute to the differences in SLN expression between missions. This hypothesis remains speculative but would be an interesting avenue of investigation in the future. Finally, due to limitations on the amount of sample, we were unable to investigate SERCA-specific analysis of RONS modifications which could provide insight into the changes in Ca2+ affinity observed here. In summary, with soleus muscles from space-flown male mice, we investigated the effects of antioxidant treatment with BuOE on soleus muscle atrophy, SERCA ATPase function, and SR Ca2+ leak. We found spaceflight to induce soleus muscle atrophy and increases in SR Ca2+ leak that could not be overcome by BuOE treatment, despite increases in SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. Future studies aimed at reducing Ca2+ leak or increasing SERCA activation could reveal SERCA and Ca2+ handling as viable targets to counteract weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Methods Muscle samples Soleus muscles were obtained from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. Muscles came from male C57BL/6 J mice from the RR-18 mission which had two control groups, ground control (GC) and vivarium (VIV) control, as well as a flight group which had mice housed on the International Space Station for 35 days as previously described5,45,80–83. All mice were treated weekly with either BuOE (1 mg/kg) or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for the duration of spaceflight. Upon live return to Earth, soleus muscles were dissected and stored in RNALater at −80 °C. Muscles were thawed, rinsed from RNALater, and homogenized in homogenizing buffer prior to further analysis5.SERCA activity assay and ionophore ratio SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay as previously described19. Full SERCA ATPase-pCa curves were run in the presence of ionophore as well as in the absence of ionophore specifically at maximal stimulating Ca2+ concentrations (pCa = 5.0) to gain a measure of SR Ca2+ leak and permeability as previously described34–36. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 induces SR membrane permeability, which encourages maximal SERCA activity by preventing back inhibition. Thus, if the SR membrane is inherently ‘leaky’ then the calculated ionophore ratio (maximal SERCA activity in the presence of ionophore: maximal SERCA activity in the absence of ionophore) will be relatively smaller.Western blotting Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD, and the three SERCA regulators, sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as previously described5,19.
