Keywords: Chronic hydration, Hypertonicity, COVID-19, Mortality, ACE2 receptors, VEGF, AQP5, SGK1, Saliva osmolality, Drinking water interventionBackground There is an urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronavirus is expected to infect up to 70% of the world’s population and kill millions of people [1]. To date, the main public health strategy for limiting mortality, to reduce exposure to the virus via physical distancing, carries tremendous economic costs [2] and may create COVID-19 disparities, as not everyone can telecommute for work or afford to shelter in place [3]. The main treatment strategy for limiting mortality involves ventilators, which may not be available and accessible in adequate quantities [4]. To address need for strategies that are less costly, more equitable, and more accessible, this paper describes potential causal paths from sub-optimal hydration before COVID-19 infection to increased morbidity and mortality. The hypothesized mechanisms suggest potential for free or low-cost, globally applicable drinking water interventions and hydration-informed treatment (e.g. hypertonic resuscitation) to limit COVID-19 mortality. Why do people die from COVID-19? COVID-19 triggers an immune response in the lungs that is described as a “cytokine storm” in the lay press and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the scientific literature [5]. “Inflammation spikes, and fluid and dying cells fill the lung sacs, essentially drowning the patient [6].” The inflammation “makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid…In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe [6].” Death from ARDS is strongly associated with positive total body water (TBW) balance, i.e. body water retention [7] (see Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Reproduced with permission from Rahmel et al [7]. Mean cumulative fluid balance with 95% CI for survivors and non-survivors of ARDS until ICU day 30.Risk factors for COVID-19 death Death from COVID-19 is strongly associated with older age, male sex, and age-related chronic health conditions [8], [9], [10]. The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) highlights the following risk factors: residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility, chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, severe obesity (body mass index > 40), diabetes, renal failure, liver disease, and/or weakened immune system due to cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications [10]. In the US and United Kingdom (UK), consistent with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease disparities, ethnic minorities are at increased risk of dying from COVID-19 [11], [12]. Although not specified on the CDC’s list of risk factors [10], given the ARDS literature (e.g. Rahmel et al. [7]), a propensity to retain body water when stressed or challenged is partially recognized as a risk factor for COVID-19 ARDS death. Recommendations for COVID-19 ARDS treatment explicitly aim to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0.5–1.0 L/d [13]. This paper posits that attention to hydration may not only increase the success of treatment for ARDS but may also prevent the development of ARDS and positive fluid balance during COVID-19 infection, in the first place.Hypotheses Hypothesized mechanism This paper hypothesizes that, compared to people who survive COVID-19, people who die from COVID-19 have too much fluid accumulating in their lungs, in part because of chronic suboptimal hydration before infection with COVID-19. Chronic hypertonic stress causes a wide variety of metabolic and physiologic adaptations throughout the body [14], which alter intracellular composition and response to subsequent hypo-osmotic challenge. Infection triggers an inflammatory response which signals body water retention and vessel dilation, creating relatively hypotonic conditions. Chronic hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia in the weeks before COVID-19 infection are hypothesized to result in one or more adaptations, including: •Greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection. •Lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response. •Increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space. •Reduced capacity for active transport of fluid out of the airways. •Reduced capacity for passive transport of fluid out of the airways. Fluid accumulating in the lungs results from an imbalance between passive and active forces driving fluid into the airspaces and mechanisms removing fluid from the airspace [15], [16]. The multiplicity of factors influencing the balance of forces suggests need for intervention strategies that attend to multiple factors, simultaneously.Evidence motivating the hypotheses Overview The rationale begins by linking the CDC’s list of risk factors for COVID-19 death with increased likelihood of suboptimal hydration, expressed in terms of hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia. Suboptimal hydration is, next, linked with each of the adaptations, listed above, by experimental, clinical, and epidemiological evidence. Metabolic intermediates or pathways that mediate effects of suboptimal hydration are identified. Experiments and clinical trials that intervene against these mechanisms and increase survival from ARDS are described.Risk factors for COVID-19 death are associated with indices of suboptimal hydration Hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia are prevalent among people who are at increased risk for COVID-19 death. In population-representative datasets, a majority of older adults have plasma hypertonicity [17], [18]. In the US, hypertonicity is significantly more frequent among males than females [17] and among Black or African Americans and Hispanics compared to Asians (78–79% vs 55%) [18]. Hypovolemia is common among residents of nursing home or long-term care facilities [19], [20]. Hypertonicity is associated with chronic disease risk factors for COVID-19 death. The prevalence of hypertonicity in non-acutely ill US adults ages 51–70 years who have obesity, high waist circumference, insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, dyslipidemia, hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome is 73%, compared to 56% among individuals without any of the listed conditions, in the same age group [18]. Systematic review of observational studies suggests that hypernatremia is consistently associated with metabolic syndrome [21]. Animal models and observational studies implicate hypertonicity and the vasopressin-hydration system in the etiology of chronic kidney disease [22]. Hypovolemia is an established risk factor for renal failure in the ICU [23]. Beyond older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and metabolic syndrome, hypertonicity and/or hypovolemia are also associated with asthma, liver disease, and impaired immune function, other risk factors for COVID-19 death highlighted by the CDC [10]. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma is associated with hypertonicity [24]. The pathogenesis of cirrhosis involves vasopressin/antidiuretic hormone, low effective circulatory volume and retention of sodium and water [25]. Hypertonicity suppresses innate and adaptive immune responses [26]. For US adults ages 50–70 years, hypertonicity doubles the risk of all-cause mortality within 3 to 6 years [18] and has been proposed as a biomarker of general frailty [27].Suboptimal hydration causes body water retention Hypertonicity, TBW deficit, and hypovolemia trigger changes in metabolism and physiology that favor cell water retention [28] and TBW retention [29]. Responses to acute and chronic hypertonicity are distinct [30]. Multiple metabolic and physiologic responses co-occur impacting multiple pathways and organ systems simultaneously [14], [30]. In free-living individuals, under conditions of daily life, adaptation to chronic hypertonicity may take weeks [31], [32]. Acute suboptimal hydration Acute extracellular hypertonicity causes water to shift out of cells following the osmotic gradient via aquaporin channels. The cell shrinkage increases intracellular solute concentrations, which activate the Na+,K+-ATPase, Na+,K+,2Cl- co-transporter and the Na+/H+ exchanger, which couple to Cl-/H2CO3, to enhance cellular osmolarity and restore cell volume [33]. At the whole-person level, acute hypertonic shrinkage of osmoreceptor cells and/or hypovolemia activate the hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Acute hypertonicity triggers release of arginine vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, which stimulates thirst and signals the kidney to concentrate urine and reduce urine volume. Acute hypovolemia triggers the kidney to produce renin, which stimulates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin 1 (Ang I) in the liver and the conversion of Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II) by the angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) in multiple organs, including the lung [34]. Ang II causes vasoconstriction and secretion of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone [34]. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and stimulates renal and intestinal sodium reabsorption by upregulating ENaC and Na+, K+-ATPase.Chronic suboptimal hydration At the cell level, chronic hypertonicity shifts metabolism to favor pathways that accumulate metabolic end-products (osmolytes) of low molecular weight inside the cell. The increased osmolyte concentrations create an osmotic gradient that drives water into the cell. Hypertonic conditions alter the expression of multiple genes. Hypertonicity activates tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), also known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT5), which coordinates increases in the expression of organic osmolyte transporters and enzymes such as aldose reductase (AR), betaine/GABA transporter (BGT1), sodium myoinositol transporter (SMIT) and taurine transporter (TauT) [33]. Hypertonic conditions induced by high-salt diet decrease expression of renal renin and angiotensinogen-mRNAs compared to normal- and low-salt diets [35]. Hypertonic conditions reduce expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor that mediates aldosterone effects [36]. Chronic hypertonicity and hypovolemia increase expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [37], [38]. At the physiological level, hypertonicity alters the levels and/or activity of hormones that depend on cell volume, such as insulin [39], [14], and/or that regulate TBW balance, such as aldosterone. Experiments in animals and healthy humans show that hypertonicity induced by high salt diet or hypertonic infusion reduces plasma aldosterone [35], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Crossover experiments in healthy volunteers report that infusion of 25 ml/kg of a relatively hypertonic solution (osmolarity 614 mOsm/l; tonicity 373 mOsm/l) significantly decreases plasma aldosterone relative to the same volume of a hypotonic solution (osmolarity 447 mOsm/l; tonicity 169 mOsm/l) [43]. In controlled experiments in healthy humans, hypertonic saline infusion decreases plasma aldosterone and free water clearance [42], [44]. In healthy young men with urine osmolality over 800 mmol/kg under conditions of daily life, chronic hypertonicity and mild (<2%) TBW deficit appear associated with metabolic and physiologic adaptations that result in water retention in response to hypotonic challenge [31]. Four weeks of sustained higher intake of drinking water (>+1L/d) is associated with a mean (SE) decrease in HOMA-IR of 2.2 (0.2) to 1.7 (0.1), a mean (SE) increase in plasma aldosterone from 111 (17) pg/ml to 143 (19) pg/ml and an average (SE) increase in body weight of +1.8 (0.5) percent [32], [31]. While significant change in body weight is not detected from one week to the next, the cumulative change over 4 weeks is statistically significant and correlated with increases in serum sodium and a muted change in water turnover [31].Adaptation to chronic hypertonicity presets for overreaction to hypotonic challenge Cells that have adapted to hypertonic conditions are vulnerable to over-swell or lyse if exposed to hypotonic conditions. The higher intracellular osmolyte concentrations draw water in by osmosis. The phenomenon is well-established as a complication of hyperglycemic hypertonic dehydration in diabetic patients [45], source of systematic error in the hematology literature [45], cause of neuronal excitability [46], and hyponatremia associated brain damage [47]. To protect against lysis, cells adapted to hypertonic conditions release more osmolytes given acute hypotonic challenge, compared to cells maintained in isotonic conditions or cells exposed to repeated hypotonic challenge [48]. In healthy young men with usual total water intake below 2L/d and urine osmolality above 800 mmol/kg, an acute bolus of 750 ml drinking water reduces urine osmolality by over 700 mmol/kg within 60 min. After 4 weeks of total water intake above 3L/d, the corresponding decrease in urine osmolality induced by an acute 750 ml bolus is approximately halved [32], [31].Chronic suboptimal hydration may increase risk of COVID-19 infection Hypertonicity may increase risk of COVID-19 infection by reducing aldosterone [35], [40], [41], [42], [43], and/or increasing insulin resistance [14], [44], [49], which increase ACE2 receptors. The balance of ACE and ACE2 receptors regulates the RAAS. While ACE converts Ang I to Ang II, which has vasoconstricting effects, ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-1–9 and Ang-1–7, which have opposite, vasodilating and anti-inflammatory, effects. ACE2 abundance is inversely related with aldosterone [50]. Hypoaldosteronism is known to interrelate with diabetes and renal insufficiency for persons ages 50–70 years [51]. In rodent models ACE2 expression is increased by diabetes and decreased by insulin administration [52], [53]. Diabetes is hypothesized to increase risk of COVID-19 infection by increasing ACE2 receptors [54]. Chiusano et al. [55] propose a model for describing mechanisms involved in COVID-19 infection that implicates ACE2 receptors, in conjunction with aldosterone and conditions that predispose to ARDS and poor disease outcome. ACE2 receptors are expressed by lung epithelial cells [34]. The spike proteins of SARS-CoV bind to ACE2 receptors [56], [34], [55]. Antibodies that bind ACE2 block SARS-CoV infection [34]. “ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease [57].” “We know that SARS-COV-2 is bound to ACE2 which serves as a portal of entry of the SARS-COV2 virus into cells—just as it was for the SARS and probably the MERS viruses. Theoretically, anything with increased ACE2 levels could make patients more susceptible to infection with coronavirus, and make their cases more severe [58].” “It is becoming evident that the RAAS system is involved in HCoV infections and presumably of high importance for their pathogenicity [34].” “Attention should… focus on monitoring COVID19 propensities for the …diseases or treatments that trigger ACE2 increase [55].”Infection creates a hypotonic challenge During infection, monocytes and macrophages secrete cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL1B) and interleukin-6 (IL6), into the circulation [59]. Increased plasma TNF-alpha, IL1B and IL6 stimulate secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vasopressin and oxytocin [60], [61], which trigger antidiuresis and increase risk of hyponatremia [59].Suboptimal hydration promotes an immune response like that described as a ‘cytokine storm’ Preliminary data on COVID-19 and similarities between SARS-COV2 and other betacoronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV suggest a 2-step pattern of activation of the immune system [62]. During the type 1 IFN mediated initial step, in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, cascades of molecular events, via transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and IRF3/7, result in the production of cytokines such as IL1, IL6, or TNF-alpha. In some cases, the virus escapes the initial step, causing extra tissue damage and antibody response, which escalate subsequent immune response to the level of vicious cycle called cytokine storm [62]; Additional, blood-derived macrophages/monocytes are attracted, activated and lead to uncontrolled, secondary innate and adaptive (T cell mediated) responses [62] . Chronic hypertonicity in the weeks before infection could conceivably play a role in suppressing the initial immune response to COVID-19 by lung epithelial cells. In vitro, treatment of primary human small airway epithelial cells with hypertonic saline suppresses neutrophil, monocyte, and natural killer and T cell chemoattractants, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL32, IL6 and LIF [26]. Adaptation to chronic hypertonicity before infection may delay the arrival of neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer and T cells in the early stage of infection, allowing time for the COVID-19 virus to replicate and infect more cells. Hypertonicity is described as a “danger signal” that boosts the immune system to ward off infection without need for de novo production of mediators [63]. Hypertonicity may amplify neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, and T cell response. Under the controlled environmental conditions of an enclosed spaceflight simulation center, compared to a lower salt diet of 6 g/d, a high salt diet of 12 g/d for 50 +/- 10 days is associated with a marked increase in the number of monocytes and “potential risk of excessive immune response when infection occurs” in healthy young men [64]. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study involving asthmatic patients, high salt diet for two weeks significantly increased post-exercise-induced sputum neutrophil and eosinophil differential cell counts and induced sputum supernatant concentration of eosinophil cationic protein, IL1beta, IL8, leukotriene (LT) C(4)-E(4), LTB(4), and prostaglandin D(2) compared to low salt diet [65]. Adaptation to long-term or chronic hypertonicity may be required to magnify the immune response, as acute infusion of hypertonic saline does not significantly change the number of monocytes in young women [66]. Effects of hypertonicity on immunity depend on the extent and duration of the hypertonic state [67]. Effects of hypertonicity on neutrophils, T cells and macrophages in vitro and in animal models have been reviewed by Kølsen-Petersen [67]. Chronic hypertonicity impacts immune responses via signal transduction cascades that involve NF-κB, p38 MAPK and NFAT5. NFAT5 coordinates expression of osmolytes [33] and augments the effect of NF-κB on critical aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses [68]. In vitro, hypertonicity stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF-alpha by monocytes and induces the stimulation of macrophages [69], [70], [71], [72]. Monocytes that produce extra TNF-alpha are distinguished as an “inflammatory subset” with potent pro-inflammatory activity [73]. TNF-alpha induces NF-κB, thereby creating a feedback system that propagates and magnifies cytokine response [68]. Increased extracellular osmolality also influences adaptive immunity. Hypertonic saline promotes T cell proliferation by increasing cAMP, which triggers a phosphorylation cascade that activates p38 MAPK in T cells, neutrophils, and monocytes [74], [75], which in turn increases IL2 production. In T cells, hypertonic conditions activate NFAT5, which upregulates TNF-alpha alongside increased expression of osmoprotective genes [76]. High salt conditions promote the differentiation of CD4+ helper T cells into IL17-producing CD4+ helper T cells (TH17 cells), via p38 MAPK and NFAT5 [77], as well as serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1)-dependent signaling [78], [79]. In vitro hypertonicity or in vivo high salt diet also impair the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), that normally counteract the effects of Th17 cells, by increasing the SGK1-mediated production of interferon gamma and inducing a TH1 phenotype (TH1-like Tregs) [80]. Th17 cells are involved in inflammation and drive autoimmune diseases in animal models [79]. Induced activation of Th17 cells results in ARDS in mice [81]. Regarding humoral immunity, hypertonicity participates in B cell activation and differentiation (Pax5 downregulation and CD138 upregulation) [82]. In a secondary phase, it increases cell death and impairs plasmablast differentiation. Class switch to IgG1 is impaired, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase is inhibited and NFAT5 response is delayed. Hypovolemia, in the context of large loss of blood volume due to hemorrhage, is known to trigger the immune system and increase inflammation [83] and neutrophil activation [84]. Effects of hemorrhagic shock (hypovolemia) on immune response are similar enough to those of hyperosmotic stress to be considered equivalent [85]. Finally, perhaps to balance or compensate for hypertonicity-induced increases in reactive oxygen species, and important when considering the context of infection-induced hypotonic challenge subsequent to adaptation to hypertonicity, chronic hypertonicity also increases intracellular glutathione, an antioxidant, via glutathione peroxidase (GPX) [81]. Increased glutathione concentrations can restore redox balance and decrease the release of cytokines and chemokines from lung cells by decreasing NF-κB activation [86], [87]. The main function of endogenous intracellular glutathione is to gauge the innate immune response to infection [88]. Response tohypotonicity after adaptation tohypertonicity Relative hypotonicity causes cell swelling by osmosis, which triggers cellular loss of organic osmolytes including amino acids, polyols and trimethylamines. Glutathione, a low molecular weight osmolyte and the most abundant intracellular antioxidant thiol, is depleted from cells in hyponatremia. The osmotically induced loss of intracellular glutathione makes cells more susceptible to oxidative injury [89]. Glutathione production via glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is decreased by hypotonicity, delaying re-accumulation of intracellular glutathione concentrations after loss due to hypotonic swelling [89]. An altered redox balance, excess generation vs. elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is implicated in lung inflammation and ARDS [90], [91]. During lung injury, in the midst of the hypotonic challenge, hypertonic saline has an anti-inflammatory effect. During injury, hypertonicity promotes cell cycle arrest, and prevents ROS formation and mitochondria depolarization, mediated by p53-p21 signaling [92]. This effect implies the converse, that relative hypotonicity during the inflammatory response decreases p53 gene regulation and cell cycle arrest and increases ROS formation and mitochondrial polarization. It is well established that the use of isotonic saline to restore blood volume and tissue perfusion after hemorrhagic shock results in edema formation, neutrophil activation and an inflammatory cascade [81]. For individuals who are adapted to hypertonic conditions, it would not be surprising that restoration of hypertonic conditions with hypertonic saline has beneficial effects. Neutrophils are primary mediators of organ injury following trauma. The effect of hypertonicity on neutrophil activation depends on the timing of the hypertonicity [67]. In vitro, it has been observed that if hypertonic saline is present before infection (lipopolysaccharide stimulation), then hypertonic solutions inhibit neutrophil activation in response to the infection [85], [74]. After hypertonic conditioning, neutrophils have an exaggerated cytotoxic response in normotonic conditions. In vitro, the duration of hypertonic pretreatment modifies lung neutrophil responsiveness to infection under isotonic conditions [93].Suboptimal hydration increases risk of fluid leakage into the airway space Chronic hypertonicity and hypovolemia favor capillary leakage by increasing expression of VEGF, which stimulates lymphatic formation and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression [37], [38]. Increased expression of VEGF stimulates angiogenesis and can increase vascular permeability 20,000 times more potently than histamine [94], [95]. It causes vasodilation, mediated by nitric oxide [96], [97]. VEGF dysregulation is associated with ARDS [98], [99], [100]. In mice, experimental overexpression of VEGF in alveolar epithelial cells is associated with capillary leakage and pulmonary edema [99], airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and mortality [97]. Clinical studies report that ARDS patients have significantly higher plasma VEGF than normal controls and ventilated controls [98]. Experimental data suggest that increases in plasma VEGF levels during infection determine ARDS risk. Following induced infection, mice that develop acute lung injury experience a significant increase in plasma VEGF levels by day 7 after infection, while mice that do not develop acute lung injury experience no significant change in VEGF levels [100]. Both pre-infection hypertonicity and infection-induced hypotonicity might be expected to increase plasma VEGF, because both hypernatremia and hypotonicity-induced aldosterone may increase VEGF. Aldosterone increases VEGF-A mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in neutrophils via PI3 kinases, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK [148]. Angiogenesis is subject to U-shaped response curves [151].Suboptimal hydration limits active transport of fluid out of the airway space Chronic hypertonicity and hypovolemia may limit active transport of fluid out of the lungs during COVID-19 infection by decreasing the expression of ENaC and Na+,K+ -ATPase. Fluid is normally removed from the alveolar space by active transport of sodium [25] by Na+ channels on the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium, and subsequently pumped out of the cell to the interstitium by Na+/K+-ATPase on the basal-lateral side [152]. The sodium potassium adenosine triphospatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) on the basolateral surface of alveolar type 1 epithelia creates a driving force that pulls Na+ from the alveolar space through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and other amiloride sensitive sodium channels on the apical surface [153]. Active transport of sodium is impaired in ARDS [101]. Dysregulation of the ion channels in alveolar epithelia cells causes pulmonary edema [102]. Impaired ENaC predisposes to more severe lung injury [103], [104]. A 50% reduction in both alpha1 and alpha 2 subunit protein expression of ENaC significantly decreases the maximal cAMP dependent fluid clearance [105]. Recovery from pulmonary edema depends on active salt and water fluid transport from the distal air spaces. Increased ENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase activity can reduce the risk of acute lung injury [106], [107], [108].Suboptimal hydration limits passive transport of fluid out of the airway space Chronic hypertonicity and hypovolemia may limit passive transport of fluid out of the lungs during COVID-19 infection by causing an exaggerated decrease in the membrane abundance of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) water channels in response to the hypotonic challenge created by the infection. AQP5 abundance is tightly regulated by osmolality and reduced in a stepwise fashion by extracellular hypotonicity [109]. Cell responses to initial osmotic challenge and subsequent regulatory volume change require AQP5 [110]. In individuals who are adapted to chronic hypertonicity before infection, the hypotonic conditions created during infection can be expected to represent a relatively more hypotonic challenge, resulting in an exaggerated reduction of AQP5 membrane abundance, compared to the response of individuals adapted to normotonic conditions before infection (See section on preliminary data and Appendix below). Downregulation of AQP5 decreases survival from sepsis induced lung injury [111]. In rats, pulmonary expression of AQP1 and AQP5 is downregulated by hypovolemia, induced by acute hemorrhage, and lipopolysaccharide infection [112]. The “decrease in both AQP1 and AQP5 may contribute to edema by essentially reducing the transcellular rate of removal of excess water, thereby effectively trapping water in the alveolar and interstitial spaces. These changes in AQP expressions either may represent a response to inflammation associated pulmonary edema or may be causal in the formation of pulmonary edema [112]”. In mice, pulmonary inflammation induced by adenovirus infection and lipopolysaccharide significantly downregulates AQP5 expression [113], [114]. Treatment of murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha results in a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in AQP5 mRNA and protein expression [115]. AQP5 expression is decreased 2-fold at the mRNA level and 10-fold at the protein level [115]. The decreased AQP5 expression is sustained 7–14 days after infection. The molecular pathway for the AQP5 downregulation involves TNF-alpha binding to a 55-kDa receptor (TNFR1) and/or to a 75-kDa receptor (TNFR2) [115], [116], alterations in gene expression via activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including the MAP kinase family, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK [117], and NF-κB [118], [116].Intervention to address hydration status increases survival Experimental data indicate that intervention to improve hydration reduces ARDS mortality [119]. Under conditions of hemorrhage and shock, hypertonic resuscitation solutions cause a high osmotic gradient that shifts water into the intravascular compartment from edematous endothelial cells, an immediate increase of systemic pressure and cardiac output with reduced peripheral vascular resistance, instantaneous increase of blood flow, resumption of organ function, increased urinary output, and increased survival rate [119]. Hypertonic saline resuscitation inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha production, enhances IL10 release, and shifts the balance of pro- and counter-inflammatory cytokine production in favor of an anti-inflammatory response in alveolar macrophages [120]. Nebulized hypertonic saline decreases lung inflammation, alveolar macrophage activation, and neutrophil recruitment into the lung [121]. In ARDS, a negative cumulative fluid balance is associated with markedly increased survival [7], [122], [123]. A large clinical network established through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) developed fluid management guidelines that have improved outcomes for patients with ARDS [124]. Consistent with a return to a pre-infection hypertonic state, hypertonic saline, and not isotonic saline, improves outcomes for ARDS patients [123].Alternative hypotheses Genetic predisposition Genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 cannot be ruled out as an explanation for increased COVID-19 mortality that is independent of hydration. A polymorphism that affects ACE activity is associated, for example, with ARDS mortality. ARDS patients with genotype leading to lower ACE activity have increased survival [125], [126]. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; −1364A/C; rs3759129) in the AQP5 gene promoter, cytosine instead of adenosine at position −1364, is associated with decreased AQP5 expression [127] and decreased survival from sepsis [128]. A gain-of-function SGK1 polymorphism could cause metabolic syndrome on the one hand and augment the inflammatory response during COVID-19 induced ARDS on the other [129] Implications of the hypothesized mechanism The hypothesized mechanism(s) described above suggest opportunity for hydration-related strategies to limit COVID-19 mortality and motivate testable hypotheses regarding hydration screening to identify people at-risk, drinking water intervention to reduce COVID-19 infection and morbidity, and treatment protocol tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Potential for hydration screening to identify people at-risk Despite lack of a gold standard biomarker for hydration [130] and controversy regarding chronic TBW deficit among non-acutely ill individuals under free-living conditions [31], biomarkers such as leukocyte SGK1 mRNA and saliva osmolality, at the cellular and physiological levels, respectively, may reflect chronic hypertonicity and/or TBW deficit and increased risk of COVID-19 infection, morbidity and/or mortality. Sgk1 SGK1 is strongly upregulated by dehydration [129] and contributes to the orchestration of inflammation [131]. SGK1 stimulates IL23 [78] to generate IL17-producing CD4+ TH17 cells [79]. TH17 cells, in turn, upregulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL2 [79]. Up-regulation of SGK1 theoretically predisposes to a severe course of lung infection. SGK1 participates in the orchestration of tissue fibrosis, by inactivating the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L, which degrades TGFß, a key stimulator of fibrosis [132]. SGK1 activates NFκB [133], a transcription factor fostering inflammation and fibrosis [132], [134], [135]. Excessive SGK1 expression is observed in a wide variety of fibrosing diseases, including lung fibrosis [132], [133], [136], [137]. SGK1 plays a pivotal role in platelet activation [129], which contributes to a severe course of COVID-19 infection [138] Saliva osmolality Saliva osmolality has been proposed as a biomarker for isotonic dehydration [139] and chronic TBW deficit [31]. Unlike serum and urine osmolality, which are sensitive to acute change in TBW [140], [141], [142], saliva osmolality appears relatively more sensitive to longer-term hydration, over weeks, than serum or urine osmolality [31] (See preliminary data and Appendix below). Saliva osmolality is regulated by aldosterone [143], [144].Potential for drinking water intervention As of August 2020, health authorities, including the WHO [145] and CDC [146], advise the public to wash hands often with soap and water, avoid touching the face, avoid close contact with people by physical distancing and staying home, wear mouth covering around others, and regularly clean and disinfect. None of the recommended strategies explicitly work to correct chronic hypertonicity and/or hypovolemia. Prospective studies and randomized interventions might test if, in addition to sheltering in place, a sustained increase in drinking water over weeks lowers COVID-19 mortality to a greater extent than social distancing alone, by decreasing ACE2 receptors and improving immune response. Preliminary data regarding effects of drinking water intervention In healthy young men under conditions of daily life, sustaining an increase in total water intake from a baseline below 2L/d to above 3L/d for 4 weeks by increasing intake of plain drinking water was associated with significant increases in plasma aldosterone [31] and VEGF, and a smaller reduction in saliva AQP5 following acute hypotonic challenge (See Appendix). At baseline, 60 min after an acute bolus of 750 ml drinking water following overnight food and water restriction, the mean (SE) saliva AQP5 was 0.20 (0.09) ng/ml. After 4 weeks of sustained higher water intake, the corresponding post-bolus mean (SE) saliva AQP5 was higher, 0.87 (0.43) ng/ml. The preliminary data also suggest that for individuals with usual total water intake below 2L/d and urine osmolality above 800 ml/kg, saliva osmolality above 100 mmol/kg (i.e. indication of TBW deficit in addition to hypertonicity) signals different response to drinking water intervention. After 4 weeks of consuming >+1L/d drinking water above baseline, individuals who initially have urine osmolality above 800 mmol/kg and saliva osmolality above 100 ml/kg show significantly greater increases in RBC glutathione peroxidase and RBC K:Na after a 750 ml bolus of drinking water than individuals with initial saliva osmolality below 100 mmol/kg (see Appendix).Potential to tailor treatment for COVID-19 to pre-infection hydration status Although “fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema [13]”, treatment guidelines do not call attention to the pre-infection chronic hydration state. The guidelines focus on the acute hydration state during infection: “In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0.5–1.0 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria [13].” “Therapeutically, hyponatremia during inflammation is challenging. However, it is important for physicians to beware of the predisposition to anti-diuresis in this context and adjust intravenous fluid therapy accordingly [59].” Treatment tailored to pre-infection hydration state is hampered by the fact that lab tests ordered when the patient presents to the clinic reflect status after infection. Recognized hydration lab tests such as urine osmolality, BUN:creatinine and serum osmolality are relatively insensitive to chronic hypertonicity over weeks before the infection. There is potential opportunity to add biomarkers of chronic hypertonicity, such as SGK1 and saliva osmolality, to clinical lab protocol. Wevers et al [34] suggest that if the pathogenicity of coronavirus infections depends on dysregulation of the renin-aldosterone system, then “a therapy aimed at restoring the RAS equilibrium provides the opportunity to treat the symptoms of an infection. Especially in elderly patients, this treatment might be beneficial as the aged population is most vulnerable to deregulation of the RAS.” Chiusano et al [55] hypothesize that the severity of COVID-19 infection is modulated by patient predisposition and capability to mount an appropriate immune response before infection. The success of hypertonic saline treatment may depend on preexisting dehydration [81], [147].Summary In sum, this paper hypothesizes that sub-optimal hydration in the weeks prior to exposure to COVID-19 increases risk of COVID-19 mortality via multiple possible pathways that favor fluid accumulation in the lungs. Evidence from in-vitro, animal, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that chronic plasma hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia may increase the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, pre-set the body for exaggerated immune response, increase tissue damage and leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or decrease capacity for active and passive transport of fluid out of the airway space. Taken together, the evidence suggests that strategies to limit COVID-19 mortality may need to account for multiple determinants of water retention, fluid entry into and fluid removal out of the lungs, simultaneously. The mechanism(s) described above suggest testable hypotheses regarding screening to identify at-risk groups, public health recommendations to limit risk, and clinical treatment protocol. The pre-infection hydration condition is measurable by biomarkers and modifiable by drinking water. The United Nations imperative to have drinking water be available and accessible, worldwide [148], might be leveraged for COVID-19 risk reduction. Attention to hydration by clinicians, researchers and public health authorities has potential to block at least 5 pathways to COVID morbidity and holds promise to prevent death due to COVID-19.

After a baseline period, the Adapt study induced increases in drinking water of 1L/d or more above baseline, which were sustained for 4 weeks. Saliva, blood and body weight were measured each week. Each week, saliva and blood were collected 60 min after a 750 ml bolus of drinking water following overnight food and water restriction. The saliva and blood results in this table thus reflect status in the hour after an acute hypotonic challenge, at baseline and after 4 weeks of sustained higher water intake. SGK1: Human SGK1 gene expression analysis by qPCR. Total RNA from human whole blood was isolated using PAXgene Blood miRNA extraction kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were estimated by Nanodrop. Equal amounts of RNA were retro-transcribed to cDNA using cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resultant cDNA was used as template in quantitative PCR reactions containing SYBR-green fluorescent dye (Bio-Rad). Human SGK1 relative expression levels were calculated using the 2^-delta Ct method. Human actin (hActin) expression was used for SGK1 normalization.

    "abstract": "Abstract Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects over 64 million people worldwide and is predicted by the World Health Organization to become the third leading cause of mortality by 2030. While allogeneic lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment for the growing number of patients with end-stage lung disease, only one out of four patients on the organ waiting list undergoes transplantation, given the limited availability of donor organs. Moreover, the clinical success of lung transplantation is hampered by lifelong immunosuppression and chronic rejection, reflected in a 10–20% survival rate 10 years post-transplantation [1]. A promising option to increase the donor organ pool is to use allogeneic or xenogeneic decellularized lungs as a scaffold to engineer functional lung tissue ex vivo [2–7]. Decellularization of mouse, rat, goat, sheep, pig, non-human primate and human lung tissue has been accomplished with several detergent-based approaches as well as with freeze-thaw cycles, and resulted in three-dimensional (3-D) acellular scaffolds that are generally devoid of detectable residual DNA and nuclei [2–17]. While the decellularized lung scaffolds produced by different methods generally retain major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, several ECMs can be less abundant (e.g., collagen I, collagen IV), fragmented (fibronectin) or largely absent (elastin) as compared to the native tissue [2,5,8]. Repopulation of decellularized lungs has been reported using a number of different cell types, including transformed cell lines such as A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, fetal lung cells, endothelial cells, embryonic stem cells (ESC), fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), primary or immortalized airway and alveolar epithelial cells, and bone marrow or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [2–17]. However, apart from use of fetal lung homogenates in combination with A549 and vascular endothelial cells, only partial recellularization of alveoli, airways and pulmonary vasculature has been achieved [2,8,15,18]. One potential approach to improve recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is to use the dynamic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, which has been shown to promote growth and differentiation of stem and/or epithelial cells (in the presence or absence of a growth substrate) [19–21]. The RWV is an optimized form of continuous suspension culture wherein cells are cultured in horizontally rotating bioreactors that are completely filled with media [22]. The bioreactor rotation offsets sedimentation, creating a constant, gentle fall of cells and their growth substrate/scaffolds through the culture medium under conditions of physiological fluid shear [23–25], such as those encountered in the interstitium [26]. Under these conditions, gentle media mixing and excellent mass diffusion are obtained [22]. The RWV technology has been used to generate differentiated lung tissue culture models, with important applications in the fields of infectious disease and regenerative medicine [7,22,27,28–31]. Specifically, tumorigenic A549 lung epithelial cells cultured alone and in combination with functional macrophages on the surface of extracellular matrix-coated porous microcarrier beads exhibited phenotypic reversion towards a more normal differentiated phenotype [27,28,31]. Moreover; when challenged with respiratory pathogens and their toxins, these 3-D lung models exhibited a more in vivo-like response as compared to conventional 2-D monolayers of the same cell line [27,28]. In the field of lung regenerative medicine, the RWV has been used to differentiate mESCs into multiple distal respiratory epithelial cell types using conditioned medium, which could not be obtained using static culture [29]. Cortiella et al used the RWV for repopulating various natural and synthetic ECM scaffolds with ESCs, including decellularized lung scaffolds [7]. While this study demonstrated enhanced cell differentiation and viability of ESCs on decellularized scaffolds compared to other ECM scaffolds in the RWV, the authors focused on the role of different ECM scaffolds (and not on RWV growth conditions) as identical static controls were not included. Therefore, it remained unclear whether the standard RWV culture conditions (~20 RPM) that enhanced cellular differentiation and growth in previous reports [27–29,31], could be utilized to improve recellularization efficiency and stem cell differentiation in decellularized lung scaffolds. In this study, we examined whether the use of the RWV would (i) enhance recellularization efficacy using two relevant mouse cell types, i.e. bone marrow derived MSCs and alveolar type II epithelial cells (C10), and (ii) affect differentiation of the inoculated MSCs in the decellularized lungs.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Cells, media and growth conditions MSCs from bone marrow of adult C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the NCRR/ Center for Preparation and Distribution of Adult Stem cells at Texas A&M University [32]. C10 cells are a non-transformed alveolar type II epithelial cell line derived from normal BALB/c mouse lungs [33], and were kindly provided by Matthew Poynter (University of Vermont). MSCs were cultured in Iscove’s Modification of Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM, basal medium), according to previous reports using this cell type [2,3,15,18], supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10% horse serum (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 100 μg/mL primocin (InvivoGen), and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma). MSCs were grown in T175 aerated flasks to 70% confluency and were used up to passage 7. C10 cells were cultured in a basal cell culture medium GTSF-2 [34], based on previous reports on alveolar epithelial cell culturing in the RWV bioreactor [27,28], modified by replacing fungizone with 100 μg/mL primocin and supplementing with 1.5 g/L NaHCO3 to support growth in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Decellularization of lungs Heart-lung blocs of adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (8–24 weeks, Jackson Laboratories) were decellularized using an SDS-Triton based detergent approach as described previously [2,6]. This study was approved by the University of Vermont (UVM) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and animals were maintained at UVM in accordance with IACUC standards and review (UVM IACUC 11–003 “Bioengineering New Lungs from Cadaveric Scaffolds”). Euthanasia was performed under standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and UVM IACUC using lethal intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital followed by removal of the heart lung bloc. Animals experienced only momentary distress during the injection. Recellularization of decellularized lungs in static and RWV bioreactor conditions An overview of the experimental set-up is provided in Fig 1. For recellularization in both static and RWV conditions, 4 x 106 MSCs or C10 cells grown as monolayers were suspended in 3 mL IMDM or GTSF-2 medium, respectively and injected in the decellularized lung scaffold through the cannulated trachea. The cell number injected per lung is in the range of previous reports [2,15,18]. Any liquid that was not retained in the lungs upon the first injection was re-injected up to five times, until more than 99% of the initially added cells remained in the scaffolds. Each seeded heart-lung bloc was transferred to a 50 mL conical tube containing 15 mL of IMDM (for MSCs) or GTSF-2 (for C10 cells) medium and incubated in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Lungs for static recellularization were kept in these conditions for the duration of the experiment, and medium was changed every 2–3 days. Lungs for RWV bioreactor recellularization were maintained statically for 4 days to allow adequate initial adherence of cells to the matrix, after which the cannula was removed and the heart-lung bloc subsequently transferred to a 50 mL RWV bioreactor. The need for static incubation prior to bioreactor incubation was determined empirically, since immediate transfer of lungs to the bioreactor precluded effective cell attachment. A rotation speed of 20 rpm was adopted to keep the lungs in suspension culture, and lungs were incubated for 3, 10, and 24 additional days in the RWV (total incubation of 7, 14, and 28 days respectively) for MSCs, or 7 and 10 additional days in the RWV for C10 cells (total incubation of 11 and 14 days respectively). Bioreactors were inspected daily for potential formation of air bubbles, removed if necessary and culture media was changed weekly given the larger bioreactor volume (50 mL) compared to static conditions (15 mL). Fig 1. Overview of experimental set-up used to recellularize decellularized lung scaffolds with MSCs or C10 cells in static and bioreactor conditions. Open in a new tab MSCs or C10 cells were introduced in the decellularized lung scaffolds through the cannulated trachea. Next, lungs were statically incubated for 4 days, regardless of the subsequent test condition. Culture medium for MSCs was IMDM and for C10 cells GTSF-2. Different time points were tested to assess recellularization with MSCs (3, 10, 24 days) or C10 cells (7, 10 days) in static or bioreactor conditions. Fixation of static and RWV-recellularized lungs for mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry Per heart-lung bloc, one lung was assessed for total RNA contents and for mRNA expression by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the other lung was fixed for immunohistochemistry. The lungs for RNA analysis were incubated overnight at 4°C in RNA Protect (Qiagen) and were then stored at -80°C until processed for RNA extraction and purification. The lungs for immunohistochemistry were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Services) for 30 min and were stored at 4°C in sterile PBS until further processing. mRNA expression analysis The total RNA of fixed lung samples was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) followed by purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. RNA was converted to cDNA using the Monsterscript 1st-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies). Quantitect SYBR Green Master mix (Qiagen) was used to assess differential gene expression with qRT-PCR, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Potential differentiation of MSCs was assessed through expression of markers typically (but not solely) expressed by (i) different types of lung epithelial cells (tight junctional marker ZO-1, water channel marker AQP5, and SPD), specific lung cell populations (CCSP and Scgb3a2 for Club cells—formerly named Clara cells; SPC, SPB, SPA for type II alveolar epithelial cells; MUC5AC and Spdef for goblet cells; Trp63 for basal cells) [35], early lung differentiation markers (TTF-1 or NKX2.1, and FoxJ1) [35], (ii) adipocytes (adiponectin), (iii) osteocytes (osteopontin), (iv) cartilage (Col2a1), (v) fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells (FAP, Fsp1, Col1a1, FN, ∞-SMA), (vi) a cytokine (TGF-β), (vii) tumor-associated MSCs (stanniocalcin, MMP3) [36,37], and (viii) multipotent cells (endoglin, Sca-1, CD106) (abbreviations and primers are defined in S1 Table). Primer specificity was tested on DNA from MSCs grown as monolayers (extracted using the DNeasy kit, Qiagen) and on cDNA from (i) MSCs grown as monolayers and (ii) mouse lungs (pooled RNA from 25 lungs of 25 week old male mice, Amsbio). The qRT-PCR reactions were performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler EP RealPlex 2S system. A melting curve was run at the end of each reaction to test for the presence of a single PCR product. The qRT-PCR reaction product was run on a 3% agarose gel in the presence of a low molecular weight DNA ladder (New England BioLabs), to assess for potential non-specific binding and primer dimerization. CT values were exported using the Eppendorf Database tool, whereafter the delta delta CT method [38] was adopted to determine relative gene expression between different test conditions. An average of six housekeeping genes was used for normalization (β-actin, GAPDH, Yhwaz, Sdha, Tbp, and Pkg) [39,40], [41]. The gene expression of MSCs grown under static or bioreactor conditions was compared to the expression of MSCs grown as conventional monolayers. Histology Following PFA fixation (see above), recellularized lungs were paraffin-embedded, and 5 μm slices were mounted on positively charged glass slides. Paraffin-embedded normal mouse lung slices (Amsbio) were included as a histology control and were processed the same way. Staining with hematoxylin/eosin was performed using standard protocols [2]. Alizarin red staining was performed to assess potential differentiation of MSCs along the osteoblastic lineage in the different test conditions, and was done using standard protocols [2]. For Alizarin red staining, a negative control (decellularized lungs without cells) and positive control (MSC monolayers differentiated along the osteoblastic lineage) was included as well. For this positive Alizarin red control, MSC monolayers were exposed to osteogenic differentiation medium, comprised of IMDM supplemented with 1 nM dexamethasone, 50 μM L-ascorbic acid-2 phosphate, and 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, for 3 weeks [42], where after they were processed for immunohistochemistry as described above. Stained slices were imaged by standard bright field microscopy (100x and 400x) (Zeiss AxioVert A1), and at least 10 regions in each of 5 tissue slices per sample were analyzed. Immunofluorescence staining and imaging Paraffin-embedded slices from recellularized lung scaffolds and control mouse lung slices (Amsbio) were deparaffinized by sequential incubation in three baths (150 mL/bath) of xylene for 5 min, one bath of 50% xylene 50% absolute ethanol for 2 min, two baths of absolute ethanol for 2 min, one bath of 95% ethanol for 2 min, one bath of 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by rinsing with MilliQ water. Then, antigen retrieval was performed by heating tissue slices in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) (Dako) at 100°C for 20 min and cooling to room temperature prior to immunofluorescence staining. Tissue sections were stained with specific antibodies as described previously [27]. The following primary antibodies were used: CC10 or uteroglobin (Abcam, ab40873, 1:1600), osteopontin (Abcam, ab8448, 1:100), collagen I (Abcam, ab292, 1:100), Fsp1 (Abcam, ab41532, 1:200), Annexin V (Abcam, ab14196, 1:500), and PCNA (Abcam, ab29, 1:1000). Secondary antibodies used in this study were: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Prolong Gold with DAPI mounting solution, Invitrogen). Stained tissue sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope or Zeiss Axiovert A1. Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40x or 63x objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package or Zen Lite. Axiovision 4.7 or Zen 2011 softwares from Carl Zeiss were used to further process collected images. Statistical analysis All studies were conducted at least in biological triplicate. Statistical significance (α = 0.05) was determined using a two-sample Student’s t-test on the biological replicates. To determine the suitability of the housekeeping genes and their average for normalization of the qRT-PCR data, the coefficient of variation was calculated. Since the coefficient of variation for target, housekeeping genes and the average of housekeeping genes was comparable (S1 Fig), the adopted normalization approach did not influence the gene expression data.",
    "results": "Results Enhanced recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds with MSCs in bioreactor versus static conditions Decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs for a total of 14 days had more abundant cells in the bioreactor as compared to static conditions (Fig 2AD versus Fig 2Ad). In accordance with this observation, the total RNA quantity for lungs recellularized with MSCs in bioreactor conditions on day 14 was on average 3.8 times higher as compared to static recellularization (p < 0.01) (Fig 3A). No significant differences in cell repopulation were observed at 7 and 28 days of MSC culture based on histology and total RNA levels (Figs 2 and 3). Fig 2. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of decellularized lungs recellularized with (A) MSCs in static (panels A to F) and bioreactor (panels a to f) conditions for 7, 14, and 28 days, and (B) with C10 cells in static (panels A to D) or bioreactor (panels a to d) conditions for 11 and 14 days.

Blue arrows point to cytoplasmic vacuoles indicative of cell stress. Airways are labelled. For each condition, images are representative of the entire lung, with the exception of panels AA and AB, which reflect a region with high cell density whereas some regions were devoid of cells (not shown).Fig 3. Total RNA levels of decellularized lungs recellularized with MSCs (A) or C10 cells (B) in static versus bioreactor conditions. Open in a new tab For each condition, mean RNA levels +/- standard deviation for the left lung is presented. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.MSCs were non-uniformly distributed after 7 days of static recellularization, with regions containing high cell numbers (Fig 2AA and 2ABB) and regions devoid of cells (not shown). In contrast, cells were more homogeneously distributed throughout the scaffold in the bioreactor culture (Fig 2Aa and 2Ab). At 14 and 28 days, fairly homogenous recellularization was generally observed for both static and bioreactor conditions, but both test conditions had regions in which cells were absent. In both static and bioreactor conditions, MSCs were present predominantly in the alveoli, but some recellularization of large and small airways was observed as well. At 7 days of culture, both test conditions showed similarities in MSC morphologies, varying from rounder to elongated phenotypes. After 14 days of culture, statically recellularized lungs mostly contained round cells while bioreactor-recellularized lungs contained MSCs with rounder to spindle-shaped morphologies in airways and alveoli (Fig 2AD and 2Ad). At day 28, the number of round cells containing cytoplasmic vacuoles (indicative of cell stress) was enhanced in both conditions (compared to day 7, 14), however, there continued to be more elongated cells without cytoplasmic vacuoles in bioreactor-recellularized lungs (Fig 2AF and 2Af). Also at 14 days of culture, MSCs in static conditions displayed enhanced formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig 2AD, blue arrows). Interestingly, formation of scattered MSC clusters was observed in static but not bioreactor conditions at the three studied time points (Fig 2AA, 2AC and 2AE). The larger cell clusters were mostly found in small airways but smaller aggregates were also observed in alveolar regions. Enhanced recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds with C10 cells in bioreactor versus static conditions Recellularization in static and bioreactor conditions with C10 cells was initially studied for 14 days based on the results obtained with MSCs. In static conditions, whole lungs were poorly recellularized, abundant debris and ghost cells were observed and RNA levels were low (Fig 2BC and 2BD; Fig 3B). In contrast, at this same timepoint, recellularization under bioreactor conditions resulted in intact cells that were primarily located at the periphery of the scaffolds and surrounding larger airways (Fig 2Bc), and approximately 12-fold higher RNA recovery was observed (p < 0.05) (Fig 3B). Still, many regions were populated with ghost cells and debris (Fig 2Bc), and therefore a shorter incubation time was assessed. At 11 days, limited cell debris was observed in both test conditions, cells were non-uniformly distributed and mostly recellularized the alveoli (Fig 2BA and 2BBfor static and Fig 2Ba and 2Bbfor bioreactor). An increase in RNA recovery was obtained from lungs recellularized with C10 cells for this shorter time frame in both test conditions, with bioreactor lungs containing about 6 times more RNA than static lungs (p = 0.07) (Fig 3B). For recellularization with either MSCs or C10 cells, lungs collapsed and shrank over time, both in static and bioreactor conditions. MSCs and C10 cells exhibited less apoptosis and higher cell proliferation in bioreactor versus static recellularization conditions In agreement with the H&E observations for MSCs at day 14, qualitatively more cells stained positive for the apoptosis marker annexin V in static compared to bioreactor conditions (Fig 4AA versus Fig 4AB). Cells within cell clusters (static) showed a similar staining pattern as single MSCs (Fig 4BA). After 28 days of culture, most MSCs in static conditions stained positive for annexin V, while fewer cells stained positive in bioreactor conditions (Fig 4AC versus Fig 4AD). Similarly, static recellularized lungs contained a high number of annexin V-positive C10 cells and cell debris at day 11, while the bioreactor condition showed cells that were mostly negative for annexin V (Fig 4CA versus Fig 4CB). Fig 4. Annexin V and PCNA staining of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with (A) MSCs in static versus bioreactor conditions for 14 (panels A, B for annexin V, and a, b for PCNA) and 28 days (panels C, D for annexin V, and c, d for PCNA) (single cells), (B) MSC cell clusters in static conditions at 14 days (panel A for annexin V, and a for PCNA), (C) C10 cells in static (panel A for annexin V, a for PCNA) versus bioreactor (panel B for annexin V, b for PCNA) conditions for 11 days. Open in a new tab An inset in Fig 4Ab with higher magnification is shown to demonstrate that a majority of the cells stained positive for PCNA. Cell nuclei are labeled in blue; marker of interest is labeled in green. Magnifications are 400x. Overlap of cell nucleus and marker of interest can generate green or white color. For each condition, images are representative of the entire lung.Staining for the cell proliferation marker PCNA indicated that a majority of the MSCs were actively proliferating at 14 days in both static and bioreactor conditions (Fig 4Aa and 4Ab). Cells within cell clusters (static) also stained positive for PCNA (Fig 4Ba). At day 28, a limited number of cells were PCNA positive in static conditions, while most bioreactor-grown MSCs stained positive for this marker (Fig 4Ac and 4Ad). With regard to C10 cells, statically recellularized lungs showed few regions with cells positive for PCNA, while a majority of the cells in bioreactor-recellularized lungs were PCNA positive (Fig 4Ca and 4Cb). Differentiation of MSCs grown on decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized in static and bioreactor conditions Next, the gene expression and phenotypic analysis of MSCs was determined when grown on decellularized lung scaffolds in static and bioreactor conditions. MSCs were chosen for further analysis since these stem cells (i) hold potential for ex vivo generation of lung tissue, and (ii) remained viable for longer term compared to C10 cells in the decellularized lung scaffolds. Main differences in gene expression between static and bioreactor conditions at day 14 included the downregulation of Col1a1 (Collagen I alpha I) and upregulation of endoglin and CD106 for statically recellularized lungs, but not for bioreactor lungs, compared to MSC monolayers (Table 1). For the bioreactor growth condition, we observed upregulation of genes encoding Fsp1 (fibroblast specific protein), TGF-β and adiponectin, as compared to the MSC monolayer control (Table 1). Table 1.

In both static and bioreactor conditions at day 14, MSCs significantly upregulated the expression of AQP5 (Aquaporin 5), CCSP (Club Cell Secretion Protein), osteopontin and FAP (Fibroblast activation protein), and downregulated the expression of Col2a1 (Collagen 2 alpha 1) compared to monolayer controls (Table 1). Interestingly, most of the gene expression changes at 14 days of culture were reflected in the 7-day cultures (Table 1). None of the other tested genes showed differential expression in either condition. In agreement with the gene expression data, a high number of MSCs stained positive for the lung fibroblast marker Fsp1 in bioreactor conditions while only a few cells were positive in static conditions on day 14 (Fig 5AC, 5AB and 5AA). MSC monolayers (Fig 5AE) and normal whole mouse lung controls (Fig 5AD) stained negative for Fsp1. Fig 5. A: Immunohistochemical profiling of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs in static and bioreactor conditions for 14 days. Open in a new tab Profiling of whole normal mouse lung tissue and MSC monolayers was performed as well. Cell nuclei are labeled in blue; markers of interest are labeled in green and are Fsp1 (panel A to E), collagen I (panel a to e), and osteopontin (panel aa to ee). White arrows point to multilayered cell aggregates, observed in static recellularization conditions and for this test condition profiling for both aggregates (A, a, aa) and single cells (B, b, bb) is presented. Since collagen I-positive cells showed higher signal intensity compared to that of the collagen I-positive scaffold, the background scaffold signal in Fig 5Ab and 5Ac was removed for clarity. To demonstrate the collagen I-positive scaffolds, the background signal is only shown in Fig 5Aa. Magnifications are 400x or 630x. B: Alizarin red staining of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs in static (panels A, B) and bioreactor (panel C) conditions for 14 days. As a negative control, decellularized lungs that were not seeded with cells are presented (panel D). MSC monolayers differentiated along the osteoblastic lineage are included as positive control (panel E). Magnification is 200x or 630x. For each condition, images are representative of the entire lung.Higher numbers of MSCs stained positive for collagen I in the bioreactor compared to statically-recellularized lungs (Fig 5Ab and 5Ac), which corresponds to the gene expression results. However, fewer MSCs stained positive for collagen I in either bioreactor or static-recellularized lungs compared to MSC monolayers (Fig 5Ac, 5Ab and 5Ae). The decellularized lung matrix stained positive for collagen I in most regions, regardless of the presence of MSCs (Fig 5Aa) and normal mouse lung tissue was also collagen I-positive (Fig 5Ad). Osteopontin was found highly expressed in MSCs grown on decellularized lung scaffolds in both static and bioreactor conditions (Fig 5Aaa, 5Abb and 5Acc), while MSC monolayers were negative (Fig 5Aee) and normal control lungs showed occasional expression (Fig 5Add). To further assess whether MSCs differentiated along an osteogenic lineage, alizarin red staining was performed. Despite the ability to differentiate MSCs into alizarin red-positive cells in routine tissue culture (positive control) (Fig 5BE), minimal numbers of alizarin red-positive cells were observed in most of the recellularized lung tissues from either static or bioreactor conditions (Fig 5BA, 5BB and 5BC). MSCs grown as conventional monolayers, or on decellularized lung scaffolds in static and bioreactor conditions did not positively immunostain for CC10 (data not shown), despite strong induction of this marker at the gene expression level on the scaffolds (Table 1). The multilayered cell clusters observed in static recellularization conditions tested positive for osteopontin (but negative for alizarin red) and showed few or no cells that stained positive for collagen I and Fsp1 (Fig 5AA, 5Aa and 5Aaa; Fig 5BA). Of note, positive staining of the decellularized lung matrix for collagen I is shown in Fig 5Aa. Therefore, the cell clusters seemed to show similar staining patterns as single MSCs.",
    "discussion": "Discussion A promising approach for ex vivo lung engineering is the repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with autologous stem and/or progenitor cells derived from the actual transplant recipient. The decellularized scaffolds also provide a novel tool for studying cell-matrix interactions and other aspects of lung biology. While decellularized lung scaffolds derived from rodents, sheep, pigs, primates, and humans have been repopulated with a variety of different cell types [2–10,12–15,17,18,43], improved culture techniques are needed to enhance the full recellularization of the lung surface area with viable, differentiated cells. In addition, as critical cell binding epitopes on the ECM proteins remaining in the scaffold may be affected by the decellularization process [2,3], restoring the normal ECM content and function of the decellularized scaffolds is of importance to support cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that recellularization efficiency (i.e. number of cells adhering to scaffolds) and viability were improved when decellularized lung scaffolds were cultured in a dynamic suspension bioreactor system (RWV) as specifically compared to static conditions. We speculate that the biomechanical force of fluid shear in the RWV and associated mass transfer result in differential oxygenation, nutrient availability, waste dispersal, some or all of which may have contributed directly or indirectly towards our phenotypic and molecular genetic observations [22]. In agreement with our results, growth stimulation of progenitor cells in the RWV bioreactor has been reported previously [19,44]. Cortiella et al previously demonstrated that decellularized lungs repopulated with ESCs in the RWV retained more viable cells and induced higher levels of apparent lung-specific lineages in response to defined differentiation agents, compared to other synthetic scaffolds and 2-D ESC monolayers [7]. In our study, the enhanced attachment of MSCs to the decellularized scaffolds in the bioreactor could, in part, be potentially explained by induced TGF-β expression, which has been shown to enhance attachment of MSCs to collagen I through induction of integrin subunits [45]. The well-spread polygonal cell shape predominantly observed in bioreactor conditions is an indicator of healthy MSCs [46,47]. On the other hand, this characteristic cell shape could also imply a lower multipotentiality and higher commitment towards differentiation as compared to the rounder phenotype in static conditions [48–50]. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the induced expression of the multipotency markers endoglin and CD106 in static but not bioreactor conditions, and (ii) the absence of MSC cell clusters in bioreactor growth conditions, which could possibly be a characteristic of multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells that have the ability to differentiate into endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm in vitro and in vivo [51,52]. Alternatively, it is possible that the stacked cell clusters observed in static conditions could reflect an abnormal cell phenotype. Our collective data suggest that a portion of the bioreactor-cultured MSCs may have differentiated into fibroblast-like cells (expression of Fsp1, FAP, osteopontin, collagen I). Fsp1 is specifically expressed in fibroblasts but at very low levels in epithelium and MSCs [53–55] and has been correlated with collagen deposition and lung remodeling in bleomycin-treated mice [54]. Similarly, FAP and osteopontin are involved in lung tissue remodeling [56,57]. Since fluid shear triggers tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix deposition [58,59], enhanced fluid shear levels in the bioreactor could potentially have caused the enhanced generation of fibroblasts. Hence, the induction of fibroblast markers in bioreactor culture conditions could contribute to the regeneration and/or remodeling of decellularized lung scaffolds. Specifically, since decellularized lung scaffolds are depleted of key ECM proteins that could play a role in cell growth and differentiation [2,5,8], we speculate that potential restoration of the native ECM scaffolds by fibroblast-like cells could be beneficial for ex vivo lung tissue generation. In a similar fashion, mESCs recellularizing the lung scaffolds in the RWV bioreactor secreted ECM components that were depleted in the acellular lung [7]. Growth of MSCs on decellularized lung scaffolds in both static and bioreactor test conditions in basal medium induced the expression of mRNAs encoding two markers that are expressed in lung epithelial cells (as well as other cell types), AQP5 and CCSP. Recent studies suggest basal expression of lung epithelial markers in some preparations of MSCs, and in response to lung differentiation media [13,60,61]. However, CCSP expression could not be confirmed at the protein level in our study. Discrepancies between qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence results have been reported previously for MSCs on decellularized lung scaffolds, and could potentially be explained by differences in sensitivity of both methods [13] or by potential posttranscriptional modifications [62]. An alternative explanation is the inability of the growth conditions used in this study to support phenotypic expression of these markers. In a similar fashion as for MSCs, bioreactor conditions gave rise to lung scaffolds populated with a higher number of viable C10 cells as compared to static conditions. Previous studies described abundant apoptosis of C10 cells when grown in decellularized whole lungs statically for 7 to 14 days, or during continuous vascular perfusion [3,10,18]. When C10 cells were grown on decellularized lung slices, only limited apoptosis was observed up to 28 days of culture [15]. Collectively, these data indicate that C10 cells could be sensitive to the growth conditions inside whole decellularized lungs. We and others have observed shrinking and collapsing (atelectasis) of the scaffolds as a function of time [7], which could result in oxygen and nutrient limitation and waste product accumulation. Therefore, the continuous movement of the lung scaffolds in the medium during recellularization in the RWV bioreactor, which results in differential oxygenation, nutrient provision and waste dispersal [22], may have provided more optimal culture conditions for this particular cell type as compared to static culture. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the RWV bioreactor confers advantages for recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds, with regards to cell growth, cell health, and differentiation as compared to static conditions. Since MSCs have been suggested to serve as stroma for repopulating decellularized scaffolds with other cell types (such as endogenous progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells) [63], further investigations into whether the enhanced expression of genes involved in ECM remodeling in the RWV bioreactor resulted in reconstituting and/or remodeling of the native ECM scaffold is of interest. Furthermore, this study could have downstream implications for studying tissue homeostasis and identifying the underlying factors that contribute to the transition of normal to fibrotic lung phenotypes.",

Copyright notice ID: 4427280 PMID: 25962111 Abstract Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects over 64 million people worldwide and is predicted by the World Health Organization to become the third leading cause of mortality by 2030. While allogeneic lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment for the growing number of patients with end-stage lung disease, only one out of four patients on the organ waiting list undergoes transplantation, given the limited availability of donor organs. Moreover, the clinical success of lung transplantation is hampered by lifelong immunosuppression and chronic rejection, reflected in a 10–20% survival rate 10 years post-transplantation [1]. A promising option to increase the donor organ pool is to use allogeneic or xenogeneic decellularized lungs as a scaffold to engineer functional lung tissue ex vivo [2–7]. Decellularization of mouse, rat, goat, sheep, pig, non-human primate and human lung tissue has been accomplished with several detergent-based approaches as well as with freeze-thaw cycles, and resulted in three-dimensional (3-D) acellular scaffolds that are generally devoid of detectable residual DNA and nuclei [2–17]. While the decellularized lung scaffolds produced by different methods generally retain major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, several ECMs can be less abundant (e.g., collagen I, collagen IV), fragmented (fibronectin) or largely absent (elastin) as compared to the native tissue [2,5,8]. Repopulation of decellularized lungs has been reported using a number of different cell types, including transformed cell lines such as A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, fetal lung cells, endothelial cells, embryonic stem cells (ESC), fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), primary or immortalized airway and alveolar epithelial cells, and bone marrow or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [2–17]. However, apart from use of fetal lung homogenates in combination with A549 and vascular endothelial cells, only partial recellularization of alveoli, airways and pulmonary vasculature has been achieved [2,8,15,18]. One potential approach to improve recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is to use the dynamic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, which has been shown to promote growth and differentiation of stem and/or epithelial cells (in the presence or absence of a growth substrate) [19–21]. The RWV is an optimized form of continuous suspension culture wherein cells are cultured in horizontally rotating bioreactors that are completely filled with media [22]. The bioreactor rotation offsets sedimentation, creating a constant, gentle fall of cells and their growth substrate/scaffolds through the culture medium under conditions of physiological fluid shear [23–25], such as those encountered in the interstitium [26]. Under these conditions, gentle media mixing and excellent mass diffusion are obtained [22]. The RWV technology has been used to generate differentiated lung tissue culture models, with important applications in the fields of infectious disease and regenerative medicine [7,22,27,28–31]. Specifically, tumorigenic A549 lung epithelial cells cultured alone and in combination with functional macrophages on the surface of extracellular matrix-coated porous microcarrier beads exhibited phenotypic reversion towards a more normal differentiated phenotype [27,28,31]. Moreover; when challenged with respiratory pathogens and their toxins, these 3-D lung models exhibited a more in vivo-like response as compared to conventional 2-D monolayers of the same cell line [27,28]. In the field of lung regenerative medicine, the RWV has been used to differentiate mESCs into multiple distal respiratory epithelial cell types using conditioned medium, which could not be obtained using static culture [29]. Cortiella et al used the RWV for repopulating various natural and synthetic ECM scaffolds with ESCs, including decellularized lung scaffolds [7]. While this study demonstrated enhanced cell differentiation and viability of ESCs on decellularized scaffolds compared to other ECM scaffolds in the RWV, the authors focused on the role of different ECM scaffolds (and not on RWV growth conditions) as identical static controls were not included. Therefore, it remained unclear whether the standard RWV culture conditions (~20 RPM) that enhanced cellular differentiation and growth in previous reports [27–29,31], could be utilized to improve recellularization efficiency and stem cell differentiation in decellularized lung scaffolds. In this study, we examined whether the use of the RWV would (i) enhance recellularization efficacy using two relevant mouse cell types, i.e. bone marrow derived MSCs and alveolar type II epithelial cells (C10), and (ii) affect differentiation of the inoculated MSCs in the decellularized lungs.Materials and Methods Cells, media and growth conditions MSCs from bone marrow of adult C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the NCRR/ Center for Preparation and Distribution of Adult Stem cells at Texas A&M University [32]. C10 cells are a non-transformed alveolar type II epithelial cell line derived from normal BALB/c mouse lungs [33], and were kindly provided by Matthew Poynter (University of Vermont). MSCs were cultured in Iscove’s Modification of Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM, basal medium), according to previous reports using this cell type [2,3,15,18], supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10% horse serum (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 100 μg/mL primocin (InvivoGen), and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma). MSCs were grown in T175 aerated flasks to 70% confluency and were used up to passage 7. C10 cells were cultured in a basal cell culture medium GTSF-2 [34], based on previous reports on alveolar epithelial cell culturing in the RWV bioreactor [27,28], modified by replacing fungizone with 100 μg/mL primocin and supplementing with 1.5 g/L NaHCO3 to support growth in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.Decellularization of lungs Heart-lung blocs of adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (8–24 weeks, Jackson Laboratories) were decellularized using an SDS-Triton based detergent approach as described previously [2,6]. This study was approved by the University of Vermont (UVM) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and animals were maintained at UVM in accordance with IACUC standards and review (UVM IACUC 11–003 “Bioengineering New Lungs from Cadaveric Scaffolds”). Euthanasia was performed under standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and UVM IACUC using lethal intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital followed by removal of the heart lung bloc. Animals experienced only momentary distress during the injection.Recellularization of decellularized lungs in static and RWV bioreactor conditions An overview of the experimental set-up is provided in Fig 1. For recellularization in both static and RWV conditions, 4 x 106 MSCs or C10 cells grown as monolayers were suspended in 3 mL IMDM or GTSF-2 medium, respectively and injected in the decellularized lung scaffold through the cannulated trachea. The cell number injected per lung is in the range of previous reports [2,15,18]. Any liquid that was not retained in the lungs upon the first injection was re-injected up to five times, until more than 99% of the initially added cells remained in the scaffolds. Each seeded heart-lung bloc was transferred to a 50 mL conical tube containing 15 mL of IMDM (for MSCs) or GTSF-2 (for C10 cells) medium and incubated in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Lungs for static recellularization were kept in these conditions for the duration of the experiment, and medium was changed every 2–3 days. Lungs for RWV bioreactor recellularization were maintained statically for 4 days to allow adequate initial adherence of cells to the matrix, after which the cannula was removed and the heart-lung bloc subsequently transferred to a 50 mL RWV bioreactor. The need for static incubation prior to bioreactor incubation was determined empirically, since immediate transfer of lungs to the bioreactor precluded effective cell attachment. A rotation speed of 20 rpm was adopted to keep the lungs in suspension culture, and lungs were incubated for 3, 10, and 24 additional days in the RWV (total incubation of 7, 14, and 28 days respectively) for MSCs, or 7 and 10 additional days in the RWV for C10 cells (total incubation of 11 and 14 days respectively). Bioreactors were inspected daily for potential formation of air bubbles, removed if necessary and culture media was changed weekly given the larger bioreactor volume (50 mL) compared to static conditions (15 mL). Fig 1. Overview of experimental set-up used to recellularize decellularized lung scaffolds with MSCs or C10 cells in static and bioreactor conditions. Open in a new tab MSCs or C10 cells were introduced in the decellularized lung scaffolds through the cannulated trachea. Next, lungs were statically incubated for 4 days, regardless of the subsequent test condition. Culture medium for MSCs was IMDM and for C10 cells GTSF-2. Different time points were tested to assess recellularization with MSCs (3, 10, 24 days) or C10 cells (7, 10 days) in static or bioreactor conditions.Fixation of static and RWV-recellularized lungs for mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry Per heart-lung bloc, one lung was assessed for total RNA contents and for mRNA expression by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the other lung was fixed for immunohistochemistry. The lungs for RNA analysis were incubated overnight at 4°C in RNA Protect (Qiagen) and were then stored at -80°C until processed for RNA extraction and purification. The lungs for immunohistochemistry were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Services) for 30 min and were stored at 4°C in sterile PBS until further processing.mRNA expression analysis The total RNA of fixed lung samples was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) followed by purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. RNA was converted to cDNA using the Monsterscript 1st-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies). Quantitect SYBR Green Master mix (Qiagen) was used to assess differential gene expression with qRT-PCR, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Potential differentiation of MSCs was assessed through expression of markers typically (but not solely) expressed by (i) different types of lung epithelial cells (tight junctional marker ZO-1, water channel marker AQP5, and SPD), specific lung cell populations (CCSP and Scgb3a2 for Club cells—formerly named Clara cells; SPC, SPB, SPA for type II alveolar epithelial cells; MUC5AC and Spdef for goblet cells; Trp63 for basal cells) [35], early lung differentiation markers (TTF-1 or NKX2.1, and FoxJ1) [35], (ii) adipocytes (adiponectin), (iii) osteocytes (osteopontin), (iv) cartilage (Col2a1), (v) fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells (FAP, Fsp1, Col1a1, FN, ∞-SMA), (vi) a cytokine (TGF-β), (vii) tumor-associated MSCs (stanniocalcin, MMP3) [36,37], and (viii) multipotent cells (endoglin, Sca-1, CD106) (abbreviations and primers are defined in S1 Table). Primer specificity was tested on DNA from MSCs grown as monolayers (extracted using the DNeasy kit, Qiagen) and on cDNA from (i) MSCs grown as monolayers and (ii) mouse lungs (pooled RNA from 25 lungs of 25 week old male mice, Amsbio). The qRT-PCR reactions were performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler EP RealPlex 2S system. A melting curve was run at the end of each reaction to test for the presence of a single PCR product. The qRT-PCR reaction product was run on a 3% agarose gel in the presence of a low molecular weight DNA ladder (New England BioLabs), to assess for potential non-specific binding and primer dimerization. CT values were exported using the Eppendorf Database tool, whereafter the delta delta CT method [38] was adopted to determine relative gene expression between different test conditions. An average of six housekeeping genes was used for normalization (β-actin, GAPDH, Yhwaz, Sdha, Tbp, and Pkg) [39,40], [41]. The gene expression of MSCs grown under static or bioreactor conditions was compared to the expression of MSCs grown as conventional monolayers.Histology Following PFA fixation (see above), recellularized lungs were paraffin-embedded, and 5 μm slices were mounted on positively charged glass slides. Paraffin-embedded normal mouse lung slices (Amsbio) were included as a histology control and were processed the same way. Staining with hematoxylin/eosin was performed using standard protocols [2]. Alizarin red staining was performed to assess potential differentiation of MSCs along the osteoblastic lineage in the different test conditions, and was done using standard protocols [2]. For Alizarin red staining, a negative control (decellularized lungs without cells) and positive control (MSC monolayers differentiated along the osteoblastic lineage) was included as well. For this positive Alizarin red control, MSC monolayers were exposed to osteogenic differentiation medium, comprised of IMDM supplemented with 1 nM dexamethasone, 50 μM L-ascorbic acid-2 phosphate, and 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, for 3 weeks [42], where after they were processed for immunohistochemistry as described above. Stained slices were imaged by standard bright field microscopy (100x and 400x) (Zeiss AxioVert A1), and at least 10 regions in each of 5 tissue slices per sample were analyzed.Immunofluorescence staining and imaging Paraffin-embedded slices from recellularized lung scaffolds and control mouse lung slices (Amsbio) were deparaffinized by sequential incubation in three baths (150 mL/bath) of xylene for 5 min, one bath of 50% xylene 50% absolute ethanol for 2 min, two baths of absolute ethanol for 2 min, one bath of 95% ethanol for 2 min, one bath of 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by rinsing with MilliQ water. Then, antigen retrieval was performed by heating tissue slices in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) (Dako) at 100°C for 20 min and cooling to room temperature prior to immunofluorescence staining. Tissue sections were stained with specific antibodies as described previously [27]. The following primary antibodies were used: CC10 or uteroglobin (Abcam, ab40873, 1:1600), osteopontin (Abcam, ab8448, 1:100), collagen I (Abcam, ab292, 1:100), Fsp1 (Abcam, ab41532, 1:200), Annexin V (Abcam, ab14196, 1:500), and PCNA (Abcam, ab29, 1:1000). Secondary antibodies used in this study were: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Prolong Gold with DAPI mounting solution, Invitrogen). Stained tissue sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope or Zeiss Axiovert A1. Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40x or 63x objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package or Zen Lite. Axiovision 4.7 or Zen 2011 softwares from Carl Zeiss were used to further process collected images.Statistical analysis All studies were conducted at least in biological triplicate. Statistical significance (α = 0.05) was determined using a two-sample Student’s t-test on the biological replicates. To determine the suitability of the housekeeping genes and their average for normalization of the qRT-PCR data, the coefficient of variation was calculated. Since the coefficient of variation for target, housekeeping genes and the average of housekeeping genes was comparable (S1 Fig), the adopted normalization approach did not influence the gene expression data.Results Enhanced recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds with MSCs in bioreactor versus static conditions Decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs for a total of 14 days had more abundant cells in the bioreactor as compared to static conditions (Fig 2AD versus Fig 2Ad). In accordance with this observation, the total RNA quantity for lungs recellularized with MSCs in bioreactor conditions on day 14 was on average 3.8 times higher as compared to static recellularization (p < 0.01) (Fig 3A). No significant differences in cell repopulation were observed at 7 and 28 days of MSC culture based on histology and total RNA levels (Figs 2 and 3). Fig 2.

Open in a new tab For each condition, mean RNA levels +/- standard deviation for the left lung is presented. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.MSCs were non-uniformly distributed after 7 days of static recellularization, with regions containing high cell numbers (Fig 2AA and 2ABB) and regions devoid of cells (not shown). In contrast, cells were more homogeneously distributed throughout the scaffold in the bioreactor culture (Fig 2Aa and 2Ab). At 14 and 28 days, fairly homogenous recellularization was generally observed for both static and bioreactor conditions, but both test conditions had regions in which cells were absent. In both static and bioreactor conditions, MSCs were present predominantly in the alveoli, but some recellularization of large and small airways was observed as well. At 7 days of culture, both test conditions showed similarities in MSC morphologies, varying from rounder to elongated phenotypes. After 14 days of culture, statically recellularized lungs mostly contained round cells while bioreactor-recellularized lungs contained MSCs with rounder to spindle-shaped morphologies in airways and alveoli (Fig 2AD and 2Ad). At day 28, the number of round cells containing cytoplasmic vacuoles (indicative of cell stress) was enhanced in both conditions (compared to day 7, 14), however, there continued to be more elongated cells without cytoplasmic vacuoles in bioreactor-recellularized lungs (Fig 2AF and 2Af). Also at 14 days of culture, MSCs in static conditions displayed enhanced formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig 2AD, blue arrows). Interestingly, formation of scattered MSC clusters was observed in static but not bioreactor conditions at the three studied time points (Fig 2AA, 2AC and 2AE). The larger cell clusters were mostly found in small airways but smaller aggregates were also observed in alveolar regions.Enhanced recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds with C10 cells in bioreactor versus static conditions Recellularization in static and bioreactor conditions with C10 cells was initially studied for 14 days based on the results obtained with MSCs. In static conditions, whole lungs were poorly recellularized, abundant debris and ghost cells were observed and RNA levels were low (Fig 2BC and 2BD; Fig 3B). In contrast, at this same timepoint, recellularization under bioreactor conditions resulted in intact cells that were primarily located at the periphery of the scaffolds and surrounding larger airways (Fig 2Bc), and approximately 12-fold higher RNA recovery was observed (p < 0.05) (Fig 3B). Still, many regions were populated with ghost cells and debris (Fig 2Bc), and therefore a shorter incubation time was assessed. At 11 days, limited cell debris was observed in both test conditions, cells were non-uniformly distributed and mostly recellularized the alveoli (Fig 2BA and 2BBfor static and Fig 2Ba and 2Bbfor bioreactor). An increase in RNA recovery was obtained from lungs recellularized with C10 cells for this shorter time frame in both test conditions, with bioreactor lungs containing about 6 times more RNA than static lungs (p = 0.07) (Fig 3B). For recellularization with either MSCs or C10 cells, lungs collapsed and shrank over time, both in static and bioreactor conditions.MSCs and C10 cells exhibited less apoptosis and higher cell proliferation in bioreactor versus static recellularization conditions In agreement with the H&E observations for MSCs at day 14, qualitatively more cells stained positive for the apoptosis marker annexin V in static compared to bioreactor conditions (Fig 4AA versus Fig 4AB). Cells within cell clusters (static) showed a similar staining pattern as single MSCs (Fig 4BA). After 28 days of culture, most MSCs in static conditions stained positive for annexin V, while fewer cells stained positive in bioreactor conditions (Fig 4AC versus Fig 4AD). Similarly, static recellularized lungs contained a high number of annexin V-positive C10 cells and cell debris at day 11, while the bioreactor condition showed cells that were mostly negative for annexin V (Fig 4CA versus Fig 4CB). Fig 4. Annexin V and PCNA staining of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with (A) MSCs in static versus bioreactor conditions for 14 (panels A, B for annexin V, and a, b for PCNA) and 28 days (panels C, D for annexin V, and c, d for PCNA) (single cells), (B) MSC cell clusters in static conditions at 14 days (panel A for annexin V, and a for PCNA), (C) C10 cells in static (panel A for annexin V, a for PCNA) versus bioreactor (panel B for annexin V, b for PCNA) conditions for 11 days. Open in a new tab An inset in Fig 4Ab with higher magnification is shown to demonstrate that a majority of the cells stained positive for PCNA. Cell nuclei are labeled in blue; marker of interest is labeled in green. Magnifications are 400x. Overlap of cell nucleus and marker of interest can generate green or white color. For each condition, images are representative of the entire lung.Staining for the cell proliferation marker PCNA indicated that a majority of the MSCs were actively proliferating at 14 days in both static and bioreactor conditions (Fig 4Aa and 4Ab). Cells within cell clusters (static) also stained positive for PCNA (Fig 4Ba). At day 28, a limited number of cells were PCNA positive in static conditions, while most bioreactor-grown MSCs stained positive for this marker (Fig 4Ac and 4Ad). With regard to C10 cells, statically recellularized lungs showed few regions with cells positive for PCNA, while a majority of the cells in bioreactor-recellularized lungs were PCNA positive (Fig 4Ca and 4Cb).Differentiation of MSCs grown on decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized in static and bioreactor conditions Next, the gene expression and phenotypic analysis of MSCs was determined when grown on decellularized lung scaffolds in static and bioreactor conditions. MSCs were chosen for further analysis since these stem cells (i) hold potential for ex vivo generation of lung tissue, and (ii) remained viable for longer term compared to C10 cells in the decellularized lung scaffolds. Main differences in gene expression between static and bioreactor conditions at day 14 included the downregulation of Col1a1 (Collagen I alpha I) and upregulation of endoglin and CD106 for statically recellularized lungs, but not for bioreactor lungs, compared to MSC monolayers (Table 1). For the bioreactor growth condition, we observed upregulation of genes encoding Fsp1 (fibroblast specific protein), TGF-β and adiponectin, as compared to the MSC monolayer control (Table 1). Table 1.

In both static and bioreactor conditions at day 14, MSCs significantly upregulated the expression of AQP5 (Aquaporin 5), CCSP (Club Cell Secretion Protein), osteopontin and FAP (Fibroblast activation protein), and downregulated the expression of Col2a1 (Collagen 2 alpha 1) compared to monolayer controls (Table 1). Interestingly, most of the gene expression changes at 14 days of culture were reflected in the 7-day cultures (Table 1). None of the other tested genes showed differential expression in either condition. In agreement with the gene expression data, a high number of MSCs stained positive for the lung fibroblast marker Fsp1 in bioreactor conditions while only a few cells were positive in static conditions on day 14 (Fig 5AC, 5AB and 5AA). MSC monolayers (Fig 5AE) and normal whole mouse lung controls (Fig 5AD) stained negative for Fsp1. Fig 5. A: Immunohistochemical profiling of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs in static and bioreactor conditions for 14 days. Open in a new tab Profiling of whole normal mouse lung tissue and MSC monolayers was performed as well. Cell nuclei are labeled in blue; markers of interest are labeled in green and are Fsp1 (panel A to E), collagen I (panel a to e), and osteopontin (panel aa to ee). White arrows point to multilayered cell aggregates, observed in static recellularization conditions and for this test condition profiling for both aggregates (A, a, aa) and single cells (B, b, bb) is presented. Since collagen I-positive cells showed higher signal intensity compared to that of the collagen I-positive scaffold, the background scaffold signal in Fig 5Ab and 5Ac was removed for clarity. To demonstrate the collagen I-positive scaffolds, the background signal is only shown in Fig 5Aa. Magnifications are 400x or 630x. B: Alizarin red staining of decellularized lung scaffolds recellularized with MSCs in static (panels A, B) and bioreactor (panel C) conditions for 14 days. As a negative control, decellularized lungs that were not seeded with cells are presented (panel D). MSC monolayers differentiated along the osteoblastic lineage are included as positive control (panel E). Magnification is 200x or 630x. For each condition, images are representative of the entire lung.Higher numbers of MSCs stained positive for collagen I in the bioreactor compared to statically-recellularized lungs (Fig 5Ab and 5Ac), which corresponds to the gene expression results. However, fewer MSCs stained positive for collagen I in either bioreactor or static-recellularized lungs compared to MSC monolayers (Fig 5Ac, 5Ab and 5Ae). The decellularized lung matrix stained positive for collagen I in most regions, regardless of the presence of MSCs (Fig 5Aa) and normal mouse lung tissue was also collagen I-positive (Fig 5Ad). Osteopontin was found highly expressed in MSCs grown on decellularized lung scaffolds in both static and bioreactor conditions (Fig 5Aaa, 5Abb and 5Acc), while MSC monolayers were negative (Fig 5Aee) and normal control lungs showed occasional expression (Fig 5Add). To further assess whether MSCs differentiated along an osteogenic lineage, alizarin red staining was performed. Despite the ability to differentiate MSCs into alizarin red-positive cells in routine tissue culture (positive control) (Fig 5BE), minimal numbers of alizarin red-positive cells were observed in most of the recellularized lung tissues from either static or bioreactor conditions (Fig 5BA, 5BB and 5BC). MSCs grown as conventional monolayers, or on decellularized lung scaffolds in static and bioreactor conditions did not positively immunostain for CC10 (data not shown), despite strong induction of this marker at the gene expression level on the scaffolds (Table 1). The multilayered cell clusters observed in static recellularization conditions tested positive for osteopontin (but negative for alizarin red) and showed few or no cells that stained positive for collagen I and Fsp1 (Fig 5AA, 5Aa and 5Aaa; Fig 5BA). Of note, positive staining of the decellularized lung matrix for collagen I is shown in Fig 5Aa. Therefore, the cell clusters seemed to show similar staining patterns as single MSCs.Discussion A promising approach for ex vivo lung engineering is the repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with autologous stem and/or progenitor cells derived from the actual transplant recipient. The decellularized scaffolds also provide a novel tool for studying cell-matrix interactions and other aspects of lung biology. While decellularized lung scaffolds derived from rodents, sheep, pigs, primates, and humans have been repopulated with a variety of different cell types [2–10,12–15,17,18,43], improved culture techniques are needed to enhance the full recellularization of the lung surface area with viable, differentiated cells. In addition, as critical cell binding epitopes on the ECM proteins remaining in the scaffold may be affected by the decellularization process [2,3], restoring the normal ECM content and function of the decellularized scaffolds is of importance to support cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that recellularization efficiency (i.e. number of cells adhering to scaffolds) and viability were improved when decellularized lung scaffolds were cultured in a dynamic suspension bioreactor system (RWV) as specifically compared to static conditions. We speculate that the biomechanical force of fluid shear in the RWV and associated mass transfer result in differential oxygenation, nutrient availability, waste dispersal, some or all of which may have contributed directly or indirectly towards our phenotypic and molecular genetic observations [22]. In agreement with our results, growth stimulation of progenitor cells in the RWV bioreactor has been reported previously [19,44]. Cortiella et al previously demonstrated that decellularized lungs repopulated with ESCs in the RWV retained more viable cells and induced higher levels of apparent lung-specific lineages in response to defined differentiation agents, compared to other synthetic scaffolds and 2-D ESC monolayers [7]. In our study, the enhanced attachment of MSCs to the decellularized scaffolds in the bioreactor could, in part, be potentially explained by induced TGF-β expression, which has been shown to enhance attachment of MSCs to collagen I through induction of integrin subunits [45]. The well-spread polygonal cell shape predominantly observed in bioreactor conditions is an indicator of healthy MSCs [46,47]. On the other hand, this characteristic cell shape could also imply a lower multipotentiality and higher commitment towards differentiation as compared to the rounder phenotype in static conditions [48–50]. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the induced expression of the multipotency markers endoglin and CD106 in static but not bioreactor conditions, and (ii) the absence of MSC cell clusters in bioreactor growth conditions, which could possibly be a characteristic of multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells that have the ability to differentiate into endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm in vitro and in vivo [51,52]. Alternatively, it is possible that the stacked cell clusters observed in static conditions could reflect an abnormal cell phenotype. Our collective data suggest that a portion of the bioreactor-cultured MSCs may have differentiated into fibroblast-like cells (expression of Fsp1, FAP, osteopontin, collagen I). Fsp1 is specifically expressed in fibroblasts but at very low levels in epithelium and MSCs [53–55] and has been correlated with collagen deposition and lung remodeling in bleomycin-treated mice [54]. Similarly, FAP and osteopontin are involved in lung tissue remodeling [56,57]. Since fluid shear triggers tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix deposition [58,59], enhanced fluid shear levels in the bioreactor could potentially have caused the enhanced generation of fibroblasts. Hence, the induction of fibroblast markers in bioreactor culture conditions could contribute to the regeneration and/or remodeling of decellularized lung scaffolds. Specifically, since decellularized lung scaffolds are depleted of key ECM proteins that could play a role in cell growth and differentiation [2,5,8], we speculate that potential restoration of the native ECM scaffolds by fibroblast-like cells could be beneficial for ex vivo lung tissue generation. In a similar fashion, mESCs recellularizing the lung scaffolds in the RWV bioreactor secreted ECM components that were depleted in the acellular lung [7]. Growth of MSCs on decellularized lung scaffolds in both static and bioreactor test conditions in basal medium induced the expression of mRNAs encoding two markers that are expressed in lung epithelial cells (as well as other cell types), AQP5 and CCSP. Recent studies suggest basal expression of lung epithelial markers in some preparations of MSCs, and in response to lung differentiation media [13,60,61]. However, CCSP expression could not be confirmed at the protein level in our study. Discrepancies between qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence results have been reported previously for MSCs on decellularized lung scaffolds, and could potentially be explained by differences in sensitivity of both methods [13] or by potential posttranscriptional modifications [62]. An alternative explanation is the inability of the growth conditions used in this study to support phenotypic expression of these markers. In a similar fashion as for MSCs, bioreactor conditions gave rise to lung scaffolds populated with a higher number of viable C10 cells as compared to static conditions. Previous studies described abundant apoptosis of C10 cells when grown in decellularized whole lungs statically for 7 to 14 days, or during continuous vascular perfusion [3,10,18]. When C10 cells were grown on decellularized lung slices, only limited apoptosis was observed up to 28 days of culture [15]. Collectively, these data indicate that C10 cells could be sensitive to the growth conditions inside whole decellularized lungs. We and others have observed shrinking and collapsing (atelectasis) of the scaffolds as a function of time [7], which could result in oxygen and nutrient limitation and waste product accumulation. Therefore, the continuous movement of the lung scaffolds in the medium during recellularization in the RWV bioreactor, which results in differential oxygenation, nutrient provision and waste dispersal [22], may have provided more optimal culture conditions for this particular cell type as compared to static culture. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the RWV bioreactor confers advantages for recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds, with regards to cell growth, cell health, and differentiation as compared to static conditions. Since MSCs have been suggested to serve as stroma for repopulating decellularized scaffolds with other cell types (such as endogenous progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells) [63], further investigations into whether the enhanced expression of genes involved in ECM remodeling in the RWV bioreactor resulted in reconstituting and/or remodeling of the native ECM scaffold is of interest. Furthermore, this study could have downstream implications for studying tissue homeostasis and identifying the underlying factors that contribute to the transition of normal to fibrotic lung phenotypes.Supporting Information S1 Fig. Coefficient of variation for target genes, housekeeping genes and average of housekeeping genes for qRT-PCR gene expression data at 7 days (A) and 14 days (B) of culture in the different test conditions.(TIF) Click here for additional data file.

    "abstract": "Abstract Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.",
    "introduction": "Introduction In vitro cell culture models comprised solely of either epithelial cells or macrophages cultured as monolayers are often used to study Salmonella enterica infections, as both cell types play critical roles in the infection process.1, 2 Following ingestion, Salmonella actively invade and replicate within intestinal epithelial cells and are engulfed by macrophages upon crossing the epithelial barrier, where they exploit phagocytes as a preferred niche for replication and transport.3 While classic two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding the interactions between Salmonella and host tissues during enteric infection, they lack the multicellular complexity and three-dimensional (3-D) architecture that are important for the differentiated structure and function of the in vivo parental tissue.4–7 Synergism between epithelial cells and macrophages is important for driving responses of both cell types.5, 8, 9 Not surprisingly, monotypic (single cell type) cultures of either epithelial cells or macrophages respond differently to challenge with pathogens or their toxins as compared to co-culture models containing both of these cell types, the latter of which demonstrate a synergistic phenotype that better reflect the in vivo response.5, 10 Indeed, it is widely recognized there is an urgent need for advanced in vitro cell culture models that mimic the complex 3-D architecture, multicellular complexity and phenotypic characteristics of in vivo tissues for use in predictive human disease modeling, including infectious disease.4, 5, 11–13 Accordingly, achieving a deeper understanding of host–pathogen interactions at the intestinal mucosa requires cell culture models that incorporate 3-D architecture, differentiation and multicellular complexity to characterize the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages during enteric infection. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor is a NASA biotechnology that was designed to mimic aspects of the quiescent, low fluid shear culture environment found in microgravity in order to facilitate the formation of 3-D tissue-like aggregates in the laboratory.4, 14, 15 This low fluid shear suspension culture system has served as a powerful ground-based tool to enable the establishment of highly differentiated 3-D cell cultures, including both mono﻿typic (originating from a single cell﻿ type) and co-cultures (multiple cell types)4, 10 and has been used to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal epithelial models to study enteric infections.4, 7, 16–20 Our lab was first to apply RWV-derived 3-D cell cultures to study bacterial host–pathogen interactions, including 3-D intestinal epithelial models for Salmonella pathogenesis,7, 17, 18 and 3-D lung epithelial models co-cultured with macrophages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis.10 The underlying concept of the RWV (Fig. 1) is to enable cell growth in three dimensions, aggregation based on natural cellular affinities (facilitating co-culture of different cell types), and differentiation into 3-D tissue-like assemblies.4 Cells are grown on porous extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated microcarrier beads which serve as scaffolds upon which they adhere, thereby allowing cells to respond to chemical and molecular gradients in three dimensions (apical, basal, and lateral) akin to the in vivo scenario. When the RWV is completely filled with medium and rotation initiated, cells are maintained in a physiological low fluid shear suspension culture environment with high mass transfer of nutrients and waste, which is optimal for growth and differentiation.4, 21 Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Development strategy for 3-D co-culture model of human intestinal epithelium and macrophages. A Experimental design for 3-D co-culture model development. HT-29 cells were initiated as adherent monolayers and U937 cells as suspension cultures. U937 cells (1 × 107) were treated with PMA for 48 h in the presence of ECM-coated, porous microcarrier beads to allow attachment. Following treatment, PMA was removed from the U937 cells. At the same time, HT-29 cells were trypsinized, counted and added (2 × 106) to the U937-bead mix. The RWV was loaded with cultures, filled completely with media, and bubbles removed. Routine daily media changes began 4–5 days after initiation of cultures. B Assay set-up for infection studies. 3-D aggregates were removed from the RWV, counted and evenly seeded into multi-well plates. Light micrograph magnification = 100×. C Depiction of a single collagen-coated microcarrier bead (blue) covered with HT-29 cells (brown) and U937 cells (red) We previously used the RWV to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal organotypic models derived from human epithelial cell lines and demonstrated their ability to predict in vivo infection outcomes and Salmonella pathogenic mechanisms.7, 16–18 While initiated from a single cell type, these epithelial models spontaneously differentiated into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the intestine, including enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M/M-like cells, while exhibiting extensive tight junction formation, apical-basolateral polarity, and mucin production. Following infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, these 3-D epithelial models exhibited phenotypes consistent with in vivo infections in animals and humans, including alterations in tissue morphology, adherence, invasion, apoptosis, and production of cytokines.7, 16–18 Moreover, S. Typhimurium invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known Salmonella type three secretion systems, i.e. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system,7 a major finding that paralleled in vivo infection observations in both animals and humans,22–27 and challenged the paradigm established by 2-D monolayers that SPI-1 is always required for invasion of intestinal epithelium. Similar results were recently reported using a 3-D intestinal organoid model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which showed that a Typhimurium invA mutant was still able to invade into the model, albeit at lower levels than the wild type.6 Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of 3-D tissue models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms. These results led us to postulate that our 3-D intestinal epithelial model could serve as a high fidelity platform for engineering an improved version able to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity normally encountered by Salmonella during enteric infection. We focused on the addition of macrophages, as they are a key immune cell type targeted by Salmonella during infection, and intracellular survival in these cells is essential for the virulence of this pathogen.3, 28 While in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that macrophages may contribute to Salmonella-host specificity and are able to distinguish between the closely related pathovars Typhimurium and Typhi, these studies have shown inconsistent trends, likely due to differences in experimental design and implementation.28–31 This area of study is of keen interest given the devastating epidemic of invasive multidrug resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections in sub-Saharan Africa linked to a genetically distinct sequence type (ST) of S. Typhimurium, ST313, which has undergone genome degradation similar to that of host-adapted S. Typhi.32 S. Typhimurium is classified as a generalist in terms of its host specificity, causing disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. While usually associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, S. Typhimurium can cause serious systemic infection in the immunocompromised. Conversely, S. Typhi is a human-specific pathogen that causes systemic illness and typhoid fever.3, 33 Thus, there is concern that ST313 may be evolving toward a human-specific adaptation similar to Typhi. However, very limited information is available regarding host-pathogen interaction characteristics and host specificity of ST313, although recent studies using ST313 strain D23580 found that it causes invasive disease in animals and lethal disease in mice, indicating it is not a human-specific pathovar.34–36 Herein, we report advancement of our previously developed 3-D HT-29 intestinal epithelial model7, 17 into a multicellular, co-culture model that provides additional complexity relevant to the intestinal microenvironment by incorporation of immune competent cells; specifically, functional macrophages. As 3-D intestinal epithelial models have been repeatedly shown to better mimic the differentiated structure/function of intestinal tissues, and respond in a more in vivo-like manner to challenge with enteric pathogens than 2-D monolayers, our comparisons in this study thus focused on the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models.7, 17–19, 37 Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of the HT-29-U937 co-culture model revealed key in vivo-like structural and functional characteristics. To assess the impact of macrophages in this new co-culture model and validate its application as a human surrogate infection platform, we applied it to characterize infection profiles between closely related Salmonella enterica pathovars with different disease phenotypes and host tropisms (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and ST313 D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2). To further enhance the physiological relevance of the study, bacteria were cultured under aerobic or microaerobic conditions prior to infection, as Salmonella must adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels during its normal life cycle both before and after entry into the host. This includes aerobic conditions prior to ingestion, anaerobic conditions in the lumen, and microaerobic conditions approaching the intestinal wall.38 Our studies revealed that the 3-D co-culture model could discriminate between Salmonella pathovars and represents an innovative model for host-specific testing that can bridge knowledge gaps between 3-D epithelial models and in vivo studies to study host-pathogen interactions and unveil infectious disease mechanisms. To our knowledge, this work represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages. This study is an important step forward in developing a 3-D intestinal epithelial co-culture model that integrates immune cells to mimic the multicellular complexity of the parental tissue and its application to understand the synergistic contribution of different cell types to enteric host-pathogen interactions.",

    "results": "Results Development of a novel 3-D co-culture model Our previous 3-D model of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells7, 16, 17 was advanced in this study by the inclusion of U937 monocytes that were pre-differentiated into macrophages by PMA (Figs. 1–2). The microcarrier bead scaffolds used for culturing 3-D cells resulted in establishment of an “inside-out” intestinal model, wherein the luminal side of the cells faces the culture media, which facilitates access of Salmonella to the host-pathogen interface naturally encountered during intestinal infection. Cells are attached to ECM-coated porous beads through their basal surface and are in contact with the external milieu at their apical surface, which is relevant to the architecture of the parental tissue. In order to develop the novel 3-D co-culture model, we had to design and optimize several experimental parameters including order of addition and ratio of the two cell types (HT-29 and U937) and the activation state of U937 cells upon addition to the model. We found that the addition of U937 cells to a partially or fully established 3-D epithelial model did not result in adequate incorporation of the U937 cells into the model, nor did it allow for the U937 cells to be incorporated beneath or within the epithelium, as would be relevant to the in vivo scenario. In addition, although we previously found that the addition of U937 monocytes to a 3-D alveolar epithelial lung model naturally stimulated their activation into functional macrophages,10 we did not find this to be the case when these same cells were added to our 3-D colon model in our current study. Thus, we decided to pre-bind the U937 cells to the collagen I-coated microcarrier beads and activate using PMA. Following PMA removal, the cell-bead complexes were introduced into the RWV bioreactor together with the HT-29 cells. Using this optimized procedure, we found that immunofluorescence profiling revealed the presence of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells as well as macrophages, the latter of which were integrated both between epithelial cells and underneath the epithelium (Fig. 2). We then attempted to enumerate the ratio of epithelial cells to macrophages within the final model; however, we were unable to successfully remove U937 cells from the microcarrier beads using either trypsin, collagenase or a combination of the two enzymes.

The 3-D epithelial model was used as a negative control (Supplementary Fig. S1). Magnification = 400×. Arrowheads are guides for select markers Validation of newly developed 3-D co-culture model Distribution of markers normally expressed by intestinal epithelium was profiled using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Adherens and tight junctional markers β-catenin and ZO-1, respectively, were found localized at contact zones between adjacent cells in both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models (Fig. 2A, panels a, b, f and g). Mucins (MUC5AC, MUC2) and Sialyl Lewis A antigen (M-cell marker) were expressed in the 3-D co-culture model and showed a similar expression pattern as compared to the epithelial model (Fig. 2A, panels c–e and h–j). Secretion of mucins indicates the presence of goblet cells, while expression of Sialyl Lewis A demonstrates potential presence of M cells. As with the 3-D epithelial model,7, 17 these findings indicate the presence of various differentiated intestinal epithelial cell types in the 3-D co-culture model. U937 cells were identified using well-defined markers expressed by macrophages including CD45, CD68 and CD84.9, 39–41 Each of these markers was expressed exclusively in the 3-D co-cultures (Fig. 2B) but not in the epithelial model (Supplementary Fig. S1). Macrophages were found integrated among the epithelium of the 3-D co-culture model and were observed in the models through at least 16 days of culture (Fig. 2B). The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed by profiling the uptake of inert, bacteria-sized (2 µm) fluorescent beads. The 3-D co-culture, but not the epithelial model, contained cells with high concentrations of internalized fluorescent beads (Fig. 2B, panel d; Supplementary Fig. S1, panel d), indicating phagocytic activity by macrophages in 3-D co-culture. Application of 3-D co-culture model to study host-pathogen colonization by Salmonella pathovars The contribution of macrophages to Salmonella infection was analyzed using a gentamicin protection assay to compare colonization profiles (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) between Typhimurium strains SL1344 and D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2 in the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models. Bacteria were cultured under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions prior to infection (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). All Salmonella strains were recovered at significantly lower numbers in the co-culture model containing functional macrophages relative to the epithelial model for all colonization time points. Decreased colonization of the 3-D co-culture model was observed regardless of the oxygen condition under which the bacteria were cultured (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Salmonella pathovars colonize 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than 3-D epithelial model. Bacteria were cultured under microaerobic conditions. Triplicate wells of either the co-culture (white bars) or epithelial model (black bars) were infected at an MOI of ~10:1. Following infection, host cells were incubated for either A 30 min (adherence), B 3 h (invasion), or C 24 h (intracellular survival). For each time point serial dilutions of the host cell lysate were plated to assess CFU/mL. All data were normalized to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Error bars represent the standard deviation from two biological replicates, each conducted in technical triplicate. Statistically significant differences for each strain between the co-culture and epithelial models are indicated as (*) p < 0.05; (**) p < 0.01; or (***) p < 0.001 Model-specific differences in adherence profiles of Typhimurium vs. Typhi We observed distinct patterns in the adherence of S. Typhi strain Ty2 relative to the two NTS strains (SL1344 and D23580). Ty2 adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at greater levels than either of the NTS strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). This difference was completely abrogated in the 3-D co-culture model containing functional macrophages, as all strains displayed decreased adherence with no statistical differences observed (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although all strains adhered to the 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than the epithelial model, there was a significantly larger reduction in the adherence of Ty2 compared to the NTS strains (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Regardless of oxygen conditions, Ty2 displayed an ~8-fold reduction in adherence to the co-culture model relative to the epithelial model, while NTS strains only displayed a 3 to 4-fold reduction in adherence. The large decreases in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression and/or localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of activated macrophages with the epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important receptor for Typhi42, 43 and has also been found to internalize within colonic crypt epithelial cells in a mouse model of Typhimurium-induced enteritis.44 However, immunohistochemical profiling of our uninfected 3-D epithelial and co-culture models revealed no differences in the localization or expression of CFTR that would explain these differences in adherence (data not shown). Oxygen-specific differences in invasion and replication/survival profiles of Salmonella pathovars When analyzed as a percentage of the number of bacteria that adhered, we found that microaerobically grown Salmonella exhibited different invasion profiles in the 3-D co-culture as compared to the epithelial model (Figs. 4–5). Figure 4 shows statistical comparisons for each strain between oxygen conditions. Microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2 in the epithelial model, while no differences were observed for D23580 between the two oxygen conditions. Conversely, in the 3-D co-culture model, SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen-related trends, while microaerobic culture enhanced the invasion of D23580. These data indicate that the multicellular complexity of the host model used to profile oxygen-dependent invasion properties is an important factor. We also found that D23580 displayed distinct colonization patterns relative to SL1344 and Ty2 (Fig. 5). Although D23580 and SL1344 adhered to both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models at similar levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A), D23580 invaded both models at significantly lower levels (>4-fold) than SL1344 relative to the number of adhered bacteria (Fig. 5A). However, D23580 replicated/survived at higher levels in both 3-D models than either SL1344 or Ty2 following invasion (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4). This occurred when the bacteria were cultured under either oxygen condition, with the aerobically cultured D23580 replicating/surviving approximately 2.1-fold higher than microaerobically cultured bacteria in the 3-D co-culture model (Fig. 5B, p < 0.05). No difference between the two oxygen conditions was observed in the replication/survival of D23580 in the 3-D epithelial model (Supplementary Fig. S4). Fig. 4.

Error bars represent the standard deviation from two biological replicates, each conducted in technical triplicate Immunohistochemical profiling of 3-D models following infection We performed immunohistochemical profiling at 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) to characterize the distribution/co-localization patterns of the different Salmonella pathovars within the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models (Figs. 6–8; Supplementary Figs. S5–S6). In both of the 3-D models infected with SL1344, bacteria were often observed to co-localize with host cells as dense intracellular clusters (Fig. 6A, panel a; Supplementary Fig. S5). When the 3-D co-culture model was infected by SL1344 grown aerobically, macrophages were rarely observed and bacteria were found predominantly in epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel a). In contrast, when SL1344 was grown microaerobically, a greater number of macrophages were present (Fig. 6A, panel d, insets); however, while some macrophages were found to contain internalized bacteria (Fig. 6A, panel d, right inset and Fig. 6B, panel b), most were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d, left inset and Fig. 6B, panel a), with the majority of SL1344 associated with epithelial cells.

Time-matched uninfected controls are shown (d, h). Cultures were co-stained with a MUC5AC antibody (yellow), an anti-Salmonella antibody (green), and the cell nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). Magnification = 400×In contrast to SL1344 infection, macrophages were readily found when D23580 was grown aerobically, with bacteria associating with both epithelial cells and macrophages in 3-D co-culture (Fig. 6A, panel b). However, when D23580 was grown microaerobically, it was rarely found in macrophages (Fig. 6A, panel e, inset). Within D23580-infected cells, the bacterial load per cell (in either macrophages or epithelial cells) appeared much lower when compared to those infected with SL1344, with bacteria forming a predominantly punctate pattern with occasional intracellular clustering (Fig. 6A, panels b and e; Supplementary Fig. S5). In line with the colonization data, the total number of host cells (regardless of host cell type) infected with Ty2 appeared to be much lower in both 3-D models relative to SL1344 and D23580. When infected cells were found, they were often completely filled with bacteria (Fig. 6A, panels c and f; Fig. 7). In the 3-D co-culture model, we observed that when Ty2 was grown aerobically, it localized predominantly to epithelial cells, with the majority of macrophages empty. In the rare event that Ty2 co-localized with macrophages, these cells were almost always completely filled with bacteria, forming ‘giant macrophages’ (Fig. 6A, panel c, inset). In contrast, we did not find any Ty2-infected macrophages when the bacteria were grown microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panel f, inset). Instead, Ty2 formed large clusters within epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel f; Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab 3-D perspective of intracellular Salmonella in epithelial cells.

    "discussion": "Discussion An improved understanding of the transition between normal intestinal homeostasis and disease caused by enteric pathogens will be facilitated by development of organotypic intestinal cell culture models that mimic the 3-D architecture and multicellular complexity present in the parental tissue in vivo. In this study, we advanced our previously characterized 3-D model of human colonic epithelium7, 16, 17 towards a more immunocompetent 3-D model through the co-culture of HT-29 cells and phagocytic U937 macrophages using the RWV bioreactor. To our knowledge, this model represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model comprised of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages. The newly developed 3-D co-culture model shares key characteristics with the 3-D epithelial model from which it was derived,17 including apical-basolateral polarity, well-organized tight junctions, expression of mucins, and evidence of multiple epithelial cell types present in vivo, including goblet cells and M-cells (Fig. 2A). The key advancement made in this work was the incorporation of phagocytic macrophages into the epithelial model in order to more closely approximate in vivo multicellular complexity, architecture and function. This is an important feature, as the gastrointestinal mucosa contains the largest population of tissue macrophages in the body, which play a critical role in protecting the host from pathogens, including Salmonella.45, 46 A previous study reported the incorporation of lymphocytes into a 3-D RWV intestinal epithelial model for enteric infection; however macrophages were not included in the model.47 When we applied both our 3-D co-culture and epithelial models to evaluate the colonization profiles of distinct Salmonella pathovars, we found that the presence of macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model had an inhibitory effect on the adherence, invasion and survival of all strains evaluated relative to the epithelial model, which contained epithelial cells only (Fig. 3). This inhibition could be due to an overall increased resistance to colonization as a result of cross talk between the epithelial cells and the macrophages or increased killing of the bacteria by the macrophages and/or epithelial cells. In either scenario, these findings are in alignment with the known role of macrophages in vivo to protect the host against enteric pathogens45, 48 and further emphasize the important role of immune cells in the early interactions between the pathogen and host. We also found that Typhi adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at much higher levels than the Typhimurium strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). This enhanced adherence was eliminated when the same strains were used to infect the 3-D co-culture model (epithelial cells plus macrophages), with the Ty2 adherence significantly more impacted by the presence of macrophages in the co-culture model than NTS strains D23580 and SL1344 (Supplementary Fig. S3, panel B). Previous monolayer studies using a single host cell type (epithelial cells or macrophages) have produced conflicting results regarding the differences in colonization between Typhi and Typhimurium, with some studies reporting that Typhimurium adheres and invades at higher levels than Typhi and others finding the precise opposite.33, 49–51 Genomic comparisons between Typhi and Typhimurium have revealed discrete differences between the two serovars in genes known to be important for bacterial adherence, including fimbrial and Vi capsule genes (the latter specific to Typhi).52–57 While some studies have characterized the phenotypic impact of those differences,58–61 the adherence and invasion mechanisms of Typhi are still not fully understood, due in part to the limits of the current experimental models for human-specific infectious diseases. The expression, localization and conformation of surface structures present on both the host and pathogen play important roles in initiating infection.62, 63 It is well established that the expression and localization of a variety of surface markers can be altered when cells are cultured in 3-D relative to their 2-D counterparts, with the former condition often closely reflecting the in vivo-scenario.4, 10, 12, 64, 65 Moreover, it has been previously shown in both 3-D10 and 2-D66 cultures that the co-culture of epithelial cells and macrophages can lead to alterations in the expression of cell surface proteins. Thus the large decrease we observed in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression and/or localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of macrophages with the epithelial cells. It was shown previously that CFTR is an important receptor for Typhi.42, 43 We hypothesized that the inclusion of activated macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model could lead to altered localization and/or expression of the CFTR receptor in a manner that could explain the drastic decrease in Typhi adherence between the epithelial and co-culture models relative to the Typhimurium serovars. However, under the conditions of this study we observed no differences by immunohistochemical profiling in its localization or expression between the two models. Another alterative explanation is that the Typhi strain was killed at higher levels than the NTS strains by the either the macrophages, the epithelial cells, or both. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to investigate the mechanistic basis for these differences. We were particularly interested in applying our 3-D organoid models to study the colonization characteristics of ST313 strain D23580 relative to the ‘classic’ Typhimurium and Typhi strains SL1344 and Ty2, respectively. D23580, a representative ST313 clinical isolate, has undergone genome reduction similar to that of other human-restricted serovars like Typhi.32 ST313 strains are often referred to as ‘highly invasive’, as they are predominantly recovered from the bloodstream of patients.32, 35, 50, 67, 68 However, results from research into the invasiveness and survival of ST313 relative to classic Salmonella strains using in vitro models have been somewhat contradictory.36, 50, 69, 70 Animal studies by our lab and others have indicated that gastrointestinal colonization by ST313 (including D23580) is low, with rapid spread to systemic tissues.34, 35 In our current study, we found that D23580 invaded both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models at significantly lower levels than SL1344 (Fig. 3B). When we evaluated the survival of each strain relative to the number of invaded bacteria, D23580 replicated/survived better than either SL1344 or Ty2 in both of the 3-D models (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that D23580 may spread more efficiently throughout the infected host relative to classic Typhimurium due to its inherent intracellular survival properties rather than an ability to invade at higher levels. Additional possibilities to explain the enhanced recovery of D23580 at 24 h include, (1) heterogenous populations of intracellular bacteria that are in different physiological states (including viable but not culturable organisms, or populations where the majority of bacteria have reached stationary phase), and (2) host cells that have been lysed by infection, thereby precluding the recovery of released bacteria during plating for viable cfu in gentamicin assays. The 3-D co-culture and epithelial models could also distinguish between the Salmonella pathovars grown under limited oxygen. As facultative anaerobes, salmonellae encounter and respond to a wide range of oxygen levels both in the environment and in vivo. Studies have reported that limiting oxygen conditions increase the adherence and invasiveness of Salmonella when used to infect pure monolayer cultures of either epithelial cells or macrophages.71–73 We did not find that low oxygen increased the adherence or invasiveness of any of the strains tested using either of our highly differentiated 3-D cell culture models when data were normalized to the initial inoculum, although Typhi did display an upward trend in adherence in the 3-D epithelial model following microaerobic culture (p = 0.07, Supplementary Fig. S3C). When invasion data were analyzed relative to the number of bacteria that had adhered, we found microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2, yet had no effect on ST313 strain D23580 in the epithelial model (Fig. 4). However, in the co-culture model a different trend was observed: SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen-related differences in invasion, while microaerobic culture enhanced invasion of D23580 that had adhered to the model. The enhanced invasive capabilities of D23580 pre-adapted to low oxygen was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model (the more reductionist model; Fig. 4), nor was it observed when the data were analyzed as a percentage of the initial inoculum. These results suggest that although low oxygen may not increase the ability for D23580 to adhere to the host, the bacteria that are able attach are able to invade or be taken up at higher levels than when they are pre-adapted to higher oxygen conditions. Moreover, this enhanced invasion/uptake was only observed in the 3-D co-culture model, indicating that the macrophages play a key role in this increased invasion phenotype either directly through increased uptake of D23580 or indirectly through cross talk to the epithelium. Intriguingly, although microaerobic culture enhanced the invasiveness of D23580 that had adhered, it did not enhance the survival of those that invaded as much as when the bacteria were cultured aerobically (Fig. 5B). This difference was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model for D23580 grown under the two oxygen conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). One advantage of using a multicellular in vitro host model system is the ability to visualize the co-localization patterns of each strain relative to the different host cell types. We found that each of the Salmonella pathovars displayed distinct patterns in their clustering and host cell specificity (Fig. 6). Regardless of the model being infected (3-D co-culture or epithelial), SL1344-infected cells were abundant in samples imaged at the intracellular survival/replication time point (24 h.p.i.), with the bacteria forming dense intracellular clusters within infected cells. D23580 formed more punctate patterns with occasional intracellular clustering and what appeared to be lower numbers of bacteria relative to SL1344- or Ty2-infected models. Although Ty2-infected cells were more difficult to find relative to SL1344 and D23580, when infected cells were found (epithelial cells or macrophages), they were completely packed full of bacteria. These distinct phenotypes observed may be related, in part, to differences in the survival and/or dissemination strategies between the three strains. During S. enterica infections, bacteria grow within cells and are subsequently re-distributed among nearby uninfected cells in order to form new infection foci that become pathological lesions.74–77 There is a heterogeneous expansion within tissues, with most phagocytes displaying low bacterial numbers and small number heavily infected.74, 76–78 It has been previously shown in mice that Salmonella strains defective in SPI-2 are still able to grow to high intracellular densities, but have difficulty exiting the cells and re-distributing within tissues, leading to a lower net growth within organs and higher bacterial loads for the small numbers of infected cells.78 This phenotype resembles what we observed with Typhi in our human 3-D organotypic models. Several SPI-2 effectors present in Typhimurium are missing (sseI, gogB, spvB, spvC, sseK1, sseK2, and sseK3) or inactivated (sopD2 and sseJ) in Typhi.52–54, 79, 80 These differences may lead to different dissemination strategies between the serovars in human tissues; an intriguing prospect that will be investigated using these models in future studies. We also observed that the oxygen condition under which the bacteria had been cultured prior to the start of the infection altered the host cell co-localization distribution pattern between epithelial cells and macrophages (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S5). When SL1344 was cultured aerobically, it was very difficult to locate any macrophages in the co-culture model at 24 h.p.i., suggesting that SL1344 may have induced apoptosis in these cells; a phenotype previously observed in SL1344-infected macrophages.30, 50, 70, 81 In contrast, macrophages were found in D23580- and Ty2-infected models, with both strains co-localizing with intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages when the bacteria were cultured aerobically. These findings are in agreement with reports showing that SL1344 induces higher levels of apoptosis in macrophages than Typhi30, 70, 81 and ST313 strains50, 70 when cultured under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, when SL1344 was cultured under low oxygen conditions, macrophages were readily found within the model, some of which contained bacteria while others were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d ). Likewise, we found more empty macrophages in the model when D23580 and Ty2 were cultured microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panels e and f). Possible explanations for these infection patterns following culture of the bacteria under low oxygen conditions prior to infection include: (1) pathogen avoidance of macrophages, (2) specific targeting of epithelial cells, (3) enhanced intracellular killing within macrophages, and/or (4) a masking effect whereby the macrophages are unable to detect the pathogen, leading to lower levels of uptake. When we compared our co-culture imaging results at 24 h to the co-culture colonization data at the same time point (Fig. 5B), both SL1344 and D23580 displayed an ~2-fold decrease (p < 0.05) in replication/survival when the bacteria were cultured under oxygen-limiting conditions relative to aerobic cultures. However, Ty2 displayed no significant differences in replication/survival between the two oxygen conditions (Fig. 5). Future studies will focus on further investigating the mechanisms underlying these differences.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In summary, the 3-D co-culture model of human colonic epithelium in combination with immune cells that was engineered, validated and tested in this study represents a new tool to investigate mechanisms underlying enteric diseases with both non-infectious and infectious etiologies, including salmonellosis. Phagocytic macrophages were incorporated in the model in order to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity and structure of the parental tissue, thereby allowing for synergistic contributions of different cell types during infection to be assessed so that host-pathogen interactions can be studied in a more physiologically relevant context. In addition, we also demonstrated that this model could be used for investigations into the impact of different environmental parameters on colonization as well as co-localization patterns of pathogens with different host cell types. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related models with increasing complexity to study infectious disease mechanisms. Using this approach, we identified key microenvironmental factors (i.e., host multicellular complexity and oxygen) important for regulating pathovar-specific invasion and host co-localization properties. We continue to enhance the physiological relevance of these models by incorporation of additional cell types that are normally found in the tissue in vivo, including the use of primary cells, dendritic cells, B cells and T cells, which will continue to advance our mechanistic understanding of enteric infectious disease in the context of the host-microenvironment.",

To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.Modeling intestinal infection with NASA biotechnology: A new 3-D intestinal co-culture model with macrophages to study enteric infection Using spaceflight analog bioreactor technology, Cheryl Nickerson at Arizona State University and collaborators developed and validated a new three-dimensional (3-D) intestinal co-culture model containing multiple differentiated epithelial cell types and phagocytic macrophages with antibacterial function to study infection by multiple pathovars of Salmonella. This study is the first to show that these pathovars (known to possess different host adaptations, antibiotic resistance profiles and disease phenotypes), display markedly different colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns using this physiologically relevant new 3-D intestinal co-culture model. This advanced model, that integrates a key immune cell type important for Salmonella infection, offers a powerful new tool in understanding enteric pathogenesis and may lead to unexpected pathogenesis mechanisms and therapeutic targets that have been previously unobserved or unappreciated using other intestinal cell culture models.Introduction In vitro cell culture models comprised solely of either epithelial cells or macrophages cultured as monolayers are often used to study Salmonella enterica infections, as both cell types play critical roles in the infection process.1, 2 Following ingestion, Salmonella actively invade and replicate within intestinal epithelial cells and are engulfed by macrophages upon crossing the epithelial barrier, where they exploit phagocytes as a preferred niche for replication and transport.3 While classic two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding the interactions between Salmonella and host tissues during enteric infection, they lack the multicellular complexity and three-dimensional (3-D) architecture that are important for the differentiated structure and function of the in vivo parental tissue.4–7 Synergism between epithelial cells and macrophages is important for driving responses of both cell types.5, 8, 9 Not surprisingly, monotypic (single cell type) cultures of either epithelial cells or macrophages respond differently to challenge with pathogens or their toxins as compared to co-culture models containing both of these cell types, the latter of which demonstrate a synergistic phenotype that better reflect the in vivo response.5, 10 Indeed, it is widely recognized there is an urgent need for advanced in vitro cell culture models that mimic the complex 3-D architecture, multicellular complexity and phenotypic characteristics of in vivo tissues for use in predictive human disease modeling, including infectious disease.4, 5, 11–13 Accordingly, achieving a deeper understanding of host–pathogen interactions at the intestinal mucosa requires cell culture models that incorporate 3-D architecture, differentiation and multicellular complexity to characterize the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages during enteric infection. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor is a NASA biotechnology that was designed to mimic aspects of the quiescent, low fluid shear culture environment found in microgravity in order to facilitate the formation of 3-D tissue-like aggregates in the laboratory.4, 14, 15 This low fluid shear suspension culture system has served as a powerful ground-based tool to enable the establishment of highly differentiated 3-D cell cultures, including both mono﻿typic (originating from a single cell﻿ type) and co-cultures (multiple cell types)4, 10 and has been used to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal epithelial models to study enteric infections.4, 7, 16–20 Our lab was first to apply RWV-derived 3-D cell cultures to study bacterial host–pathogen interactions, including 3-D intestinal epithelial models for Salmonella pathogenesis,7, 17, 18 and 3-D lung epithelial models co-cultured with macrophages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis.10 The underlying concept of the RWV (Fig. 1) is to enable cell growth in three dimensions, aggregation based on natural cellular affinities (facilitating co-culture of different cell types), and differentiation into 3-D tissue-like assemblies.4 Cells are grown on porous extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated microcarrier beads which serve as scaffolds upon which they adhere, thereby allowing cells to respond to chemical and molecular gradients in three dimensions (apical, basal, and lateral) akin to the in vivo scenario. When the RWV is completely filled with medium and rotation initiated, cells are maintained in a physiological low fluid shear suspension culture environment with high mass transfer of nutrients and waste, which is optimal for growth and differentiation.4, 21 Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Development strategy for 3-D co-culture model of human intestinal epithelium and macrophages. A Experimental design for 3-D co-culture model development. HT-29 cells were initiated as adherent monolayers and U937 cells as suspension cultures. U937 cells (1 × 107) were treated with PMA for 48 h in the presence of ECM-coated, porous microcarrier beads to allow attachment. Following treatment, PMA was removed from the U937 cells. At the same time, HT-29 cells were trypsinized, counted and added (2 × 106) to the U937-bead mix. The RWV was loaded with cultures, filled completely with media, and bubbles removed. Routine daily media changes began 4–5 days after initiation of cultures. B Assay set-up for infection studies. 3-D aggregates were removed from the RWV, counted and evenly seeded into multi-well plates. Light micrograph magnification = 100×. C Depiction of a single collagen-coated microcarrier bead (blue) covered with HT-29 cells (brown) and U937 cells (red)We previously used the RWV to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal organotypic models derived from human epithelial cell lines and demonstrated their ability to predict in vivo infection outcomes and Salmonella pathogenic mechanisms.7, 16–18 While initiated from a single cell type, these epithelial models spontaneously differentiated into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the intestine, including enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M/M-like cells, while exhibiting extensive tight junction formation, apical-basolateral polarity, and mucin production. Following infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, these 3-D epithelial models exhibited phenotypes consistent with in vivo infections in animals and humans, including alterations in tissue morphology, adherence, invasion, apoptosis, and production of cytokines.7, 16–18 Moreover, S. Typhimurium invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known Salmonella type three secretion systems, i.e. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system,7 a major finding that paralleled in vivo infection observations in both animals and humans,22–27 and challenged the paradigm established by 2-D monolayers that SPI-1 is always required for invasion of intestinal epithelium. Similar results were recently reported using a 3-D intestinal organoid model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which showed that a Typhimurium invA mutant was still able to invade into the model, albeit at lower levels than the wild type.6 Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of 3-D tissue models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms. These results led us to postulate that our 3-D intestinal epithelial model could serve as a high fidelity platform for engineering an improved version able to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity normally encountered by Salmonella during enteric infection. We focused on the addition of macrophages, as they are a key immune cell type targeted by Salmonella during infection, and intracellular survival in these cells is essential for the virulence of this pathogen.3, 28 While in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that macrophages may contribute to Salmonella-host specificity and are able to distinguish between the closely related pathovars Typhimurium and Typhi, these studies have shown inconsistent trends, likely due to differences in experimental design and implementation.28–31 This area of study is of keen interest given the devastating epidemic of invasive multidrug resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections in sub-Saharan Africa linked to a genetically distinct sequence type (ST) of S. Typhimurium, ST313, which has undergone genome degradation similar to that of host-adapted S. Typhi.32 S. Typhimurium is classified as a generalist in terms of its host specificity, causing disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. While usually associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, S. Typhimurium can cause serious systemic infection in the immunocompromised. Conversely, S. Typhi is a human-specific pathogen that causes systemic illness and typhoid fever.3, 33 Thus, there is concern that ST313 may be evolving toward a human-specific adaptation similar to Typhi. However, very limited information is available regarding host-pathogen interaction characteristics and host specificity of ST313, although recent studies using ST313 strain D23580 found that it causes invasive disease in animals and lethal disease in mice, indicating it is not a human-specific pathovar.34–36 Herein, we report advancement of our previously developed 3-D HT-29 intestinal epithelial model7, 17 into a multicellular, co-culture model that provides additional complexity relevant to the intestinal microenvironment by incorporation of immune competent cells; specifically, functional macrophages. As 3-D intestinal epithelial models have been repeatedly shown to better mimic the differentiated structure/function of intestinal tissues, and respond in a more in vivo-like manner to challenge with enteric pathogens than 2-D monolayers, our comparisons in this study thus focused on the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models.7, 17–19, 37 Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of the HT-29-U937 co-culture model revealed key in vivo-like structural and functional characteristics. To assess the impact of macrophages in this new co-culture model and validate its application as a human surrogate infection platform, we applied it to characterize infection profiles between closely related Salmonella enterica pathovars with different disease phenotypes and host tropisms (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and ST313 D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2). To further enhance the physiological relevance of the study, bacteria were cultured under aerobic or microaerobic conditions prior to infection, as Salmonella must adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels during its normal life cycle both before and after entry into the host. This includes aerobic conditions prior to ingestion, anaerobic conditions in the lumen, and microaerobic conditions approaching the intestinal wall.38 Our studies revealed that the 3-D co-culture model could discriminate between Salmonella pathovars and represents an innovative model for host-specific testing that can bridge knowledge gaps between 3-D epithelial models and in vivo studies to study host-pathogen interactions and unveil infectious disease mechanisms. To our knowledge, this work represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages. This study is an important step forward in developing a 3-D intestinal epithelial co-culture model that integrates immune cells to mimic the multicellular complexity of the parental tissue and its application to understand the synergistic contribution of different cell types to enteric host-pathogen interactions.Results Development of a novel 3-D co-culture model Our previous 3-D model of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells7, 16, 17 was advanced in this study by the inclusion of U937 monocytes that were pre-differentiated into macrophages by PMA (Figs. 1–2). The microcarrier bead scaffolds used for culturing 3-D cells resulted in establishment of an “inside-out” intestinal model, wherein the luminal side of the cells faces the culture media, which facilitates access of Salmonella to the host-pathogen interface naturally encountered during intestinal infection. Cells are attached to ECM-coated porous beads through their basal surface and are in contact with the external milieu at their apical surface, which is relevant to the architecture of the parental tissue. In order to develop the novel 3-D co-culture model, we had to design and optimize several experimental parameters including order of addition and ratio of the two cell types (HT-29 and U937) and the activation state of U937 cells upon addition to the model. We found that the addition of U937 cells to a partially or fully established 3-D epithelial model did not result in adequate incorporation of the U937 cells into the model, nor did it allow for the U937 cells to be incorporated beneath or within the epithelium, as would be relevant to the in vivo scenario. In addition, although we previously found that the addition of U937 monocytes to a 3-D alveolar epithelial lung model naturally stimulated their activation into functional macrophages,10 we did not find this to be the case when these same cells were added to our 3-D colon model in our current study. Thus, we decided to pre-bind the U937 cells to the collagen I-coated microcarrier beads and activate using PMA. Following PMA removal, the cell-bead complexes were introduced into the RWV bioreactor together with the HT-29 cells. Using this optimized procedure, we found that immunofluorescence profiling revealed the presence of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells as well as macrophages, the latter of which were integrated both between epithelial cells and underneath the epithelium (Fig. 2). We then attempted to enumerate the ratio of epithelial cells to macrophages within the final model; however, we were unable to successfully remove U937 cells from the microcarrier beads using either trypsin, collagenase or a combination of the two enzymes.

The 3-D epithelial model was used as a negative control (Supplementary Fig. S1). Magnification = 400×. Arrowheads are guides for select markersValidation of newly developed 3-D co-culture model Distribution of markers normally expressed by intestinal epithelium was profiled using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Adherens and tight junctional markers β-catenin and ZO-1, respectively, were found localized at contact zones between adjacent cells in both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models (Fig. 2A, panels a, b, f and g). Mucins (MUC5AC, MUC2) and Sialyl Lewis A antigen (M-cell marker) were expressed in the 3-D co-culture model and showed a similar expression pattern as compared to the epithelial model (Fig. 2A, panels c–e and h–j). Secretion of mucins indicates the presence of goblet cells, while expression of Sialyl Lewis A demonstrates potential presence of M cells. As with the 3-D epithelial model,7, 17 these findings indicate the presence of various differentiated intestinal epithelial cell types in the 3-D co-culture model. U937 cells were identified using well-defined markers expressed by macrophages including CD45, CD68 and CD84.9, 39–41 Each of these markers was expressed exclusively in the 3-D co-cultures (Fig. 2B) but not in the epithelial model (Supplementary Fig. S1). Macrophages were found integrated among the epithelium of the 3-D co-culture model and were observed in the models through at least 16 days of culture (Fig. 2B). The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed by profiling the uptake of inert, bacteria-sized (2 µm) fluorescent beads. The 3-D co-culture, but not the epithelial model, contained cells with high concentrations of internalized fluorescent beads (Fig. 2B, panel d; Supplementary Fig. S1, panel d), indicating phagocytic activity by macrophages in 3-D co-culture.Application of 3-D co-culture model to study host-pathogen colonization by Salmonella pathovars The contribution of macrophages to Salmonella infection was analyzed using a gentamicin protection assay to compare colonization profiles (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) between Typhimurium strains SL1344 and D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2 in the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models. Bacteria were cultured under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions prior to infection (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). All Salmonella strains were recovered at significantly lower numbers in the co-culture model containing functional macrophages relative to the epithelial model for all colonization time points. Decreased colonization of the 3-D co-culture model was observed regardless of the oxygen condition under which the bacteria were cultured (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Salmonella pathovars colonize 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than 3-D epithelial model. Bacteria were cultured under microaerobic conditions. Triplicate wells of either the co-culture (white bars) or epithelial model (black bars) were infected at an MOI of ~10:1. Following infection, host cells were incubated for either A 30 min (adherence), B 3 h (invasion), or C 24 h (intracellular survival). For each time point serial dilutions of the host cell lysate were plated to assess CFU/mL. All data were normalized to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Error bars represent the standard deviation from two biological replicates, each conducted in technical triplicate. Statistically significant differences for each strain between the co-culture and epithelial models are indicated as (*) p < 0.05; (**) p < 0.01; or (***) p < 0.001Model-specific differences in adherence profiles of Typhimurium vs. Typhi We observed distinct patterns in the adherence of S. Typhi strain Ty2 relative to the two NTS strains (SL1344 and D23580). Ty2 adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at greater levels than either of the NTS strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). This difference was completely abrogated in the 3-D co-culture model containing functional macrophages, as all strains displayed decreased adherence with no statistical differences observed (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although all strains adhered to the 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than the epithelial model, there was a significantly larger reduction in the adherence of Ty2 compared to the NTS strains (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Regardless of oxygen conditions, Ty2 displayed an ~8-fold reduction in adherence to the co-culture model relative to the epithelial model, while NTS strains only displayed a 3 to 4-fold reduction in adherence. The large decreases in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression and/or localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of activated macrophages with the epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important receptor for Typhi42, 43 and has also been found to internalize within colonic crypt epithelial cells in a mouse model of Typhimurium-induced enteritis.44 However, immunohistochemical profiling of our uninfected 3-D epithelial and co-culture models revealed no differences in the localization or expression of CFTR that would explain these differences in adherence (data not shown).Oxygen-specific differences in invasion and replication/survival profiles of Salmonella pathovars When analyzed as a percentage of the number of bacteria that adhered, we found that microaerobically grown Salmonella exhibited different invasion profiles in the 3-D co-culture as compared to the epithelial model (Figs. 4–5). Figure 4 shows statistical comparisons for each strain between oxygen conditions. Microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2 in the epithelial model, while no differences were observed for D23580 between the two oxygen conditions. Conversely, in the 3-D co-culture model, SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen-related trends, while microaerobic culture enhanced the invasion of D23580. These data indicate that the multicellular complexity of the host model used to profile oxygen-dependent invasion properties is an important factor. We also found that D23580 displayed distinct colonization patterns relative to SL1344 and Ty2 (Fig. 5). Although D23580 and SL1344 adhered to both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models at similar levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A), D23580 invaded both models at significantly lower levels (>4-fold) than SL1344 relative to the number of adhered bacteria (Fig. 5A). However, D23580 replicated/survived at higher levels in both 3-D models than either SL1344 or Ty2 following invasion (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4). This occurred when the bacteria were cultured under either oxygen condition, with the aerobically cultured D23580 replicating/surviving approximately 2.1-fold higher than microaerobically cultured bacteria in the 3-D co-culture model (Fig. 5B, p < 0.05). No difference between the two oxygen conditions was observed in the replication/survival of D23580 in the 3-D epithelial model (Supplementary Fig. S4). Fig. 4.

Error bars represent the standard deviation from two biological replicates, each conducted in technical triplicateImmunohistochemical profiling of 3-D models following infection We performed immunohistochemical profiling at 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) to characterize the distribution/co-localization patterns of the different Salmonella pathovars within the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models (Figs. 6–8; Supplementary Figs. S5–S6). In both of the 3-D models infected with SL1344, bacteria were often observed to co-localize with host cells as dense intracellular clusters (Fig. 6A, panel a; Supplementary Fig. S5). When the 3-D co-culture model was infected by SL1344 grown aerobically, macrophages were rarely observed and bacteria were found predominantly in epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel a). In contrast, when SL1344 was grown microaerobically, a greater number of macrophages were present (Fig. 6A, panel d, insets); however, while some macrophages were found to contain internalized bacteria (Fig. 6A, panel d, right inset and Fig. 6B, panel b), most were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d, left inset and Fig. 6B, panel a), with the majority of SL1344 associated with epithelial cells.

The 3-D co-culture model (a–d) and 3-D epithelial model (e–h) were fixed 24 h.p.i. with either SL1344 (a, e), D23580 (b, f) or Ty2 (c, g) that had been cultured under microaerobic conditions. Time-matched uninfected controls are shown (d, h). Cultures were co-stained with a MUC5AC antibody (yellow), an anti-Salmonella antibody (green), and the cell nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). Magnification = 400×In contrast to SL1344 infection, macrophages were readily found when D23580 was grown aerobically, with bacteria associating with both epithelial cells and macrophages in 3-D co-culture (Fig. 6A, panel b). However, when D23580 was grown microaerobically, it was rarely found in macrophages (Fig. 6A, panel e, inset). Within D23580-infected cells, the bacterial load per cell (in either macrophages or epithelial cells) appeared much lower when compared to those infected with SL1344, with bacteria forming a predominantly punctate pattern with occasional intracellular clustering (Fig. 6A, panels b and e; Supplementary Fig. S5). In line with the colonization data, the total number of host cells (regardless of host cell type) infected with Ty2 appeared to be much lower in both 3-D models relative to SL1344 and D23580. When infected cells were found, they were often completely filled with bacteria (Fig. 6A, panels c and f; Fig. 7). In the 3-D co-culture model, we observed that when Ty2 was grown aerobically, it localized predominantly to epithelial cells, with the majority of macrophages empty. In the rare event that Ty2 co-localized with macrophages, these cells were almost always completely filled with bacteria, forming ‘giant macrophages’ (Fig. 6A, panel c, inset). In contrast, we did not find any Ty2-infected macrophages when the bacteria were grown microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panel f, inset). Instead, Ty2 formed large clusters within epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel f; Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab 3-D perspective of intracellular Salmonella in epithelial cells.

We observed enhanced expression of MUC5AC following infection in both 3-D models relative to uninfected controls (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. S7), although no clear differences in mucus production between individual pathovars was observed.Discussion An improved understanding of the transition between normal intestinal homeostasis and disease caused by enteric pathogens will be facilitated by development of organotypic intestinal cell culture models that mimic the 3-D architecture and multicellular complexity present in the parental tissue in vivo. In this study, we advanced our previously characterized 3-D model of human colonic epithelium7, 16, 17 towards a more immunocompetent 3-D model through the co-culture of HT-29 cells and phagocytic U937 macrophages using the RWV bioreactor. To our knowledge, this model represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model comprised of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages. The newly developed 3-D co-culture model shares key characteristics with the 3-D epithelial model from which it was derived,17 including apical-basolateral polarity, well-organized tight junctions, expression of mucins, and evidence of multiple epithelial cell types present in vivo, including goblet cells and M-cells (Fig. 2A). The key advancement made in this work was the incorporation of phagocytic macrophages into the epithelial model in order to more closely approximate in vivo multicellular complexity, architecture and function. This is an important feature, as the gastrointestinal mucosa contains the largest population of tissue macrophages in the body, which play a critical role in protecting the host from pathogens, including Salmonella.45, 46 A previous study reported the incorporation of lymphocytes into a 3-D RWV intestinal epithelial model for enteric infection; however macrophages were not included in the model.47 When we applied both our 3-D co-culture and epithelial models to evaluate the colonization profiles of distinct Salmonella pathovars, we found that the presence of macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model had an inhibitory effect on the adherence, invasion and survival of all strains evaluated relative to the epithelial model, which contained epithelial cells only (Fig. 3). This inhibition could be due to an overall increased resistance to colonization as a result of cross talk between the epithelial cells and the macrophages or increased killing of the bacteria by the macrophages and/or epithelial cells. In either scenario, these findings are in alignment with the known role of macrophages in vivo to protect the host against enteric pathogens45, 48 and further emphasize the important role of immune cells in the early interactions between the pathogen and host. We also found that Typhi adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at much higher levels than the Typhimurium strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). This enhanced adherence was eliminated when the same strains were used to infect the 3-D co-culture model (epithelial cells plus macrophages), with the Ty2 adherence significantly more impacted by the presence of macrophages in the co-culture model than NTS strains D23580 and SL1344 (Supplementary Fig. S3, panel B). Previous monolayer studies using a single host cell type (epithelial cells or macrophages) have produced conflicting results regarding the differences in colonization between Typhi and Typhimurium, with some studies reporting that Typhimurium adheres and invades at higher levels than Typhi and others finding the precise opposite.33, 49–51 Genomic comparisons between Typhi and Typhimurium have revealed discrete differences between the two serovars in genes known to be important for bacterial adherence, including fimbrial and Vi capsule genes (the latter specific to Typhi).52–57 While some studies have characterized the phenotypic impact of those differences,58–61 the adherence and invasion mechanisms of Typhi are still not fully understood, due in part to the limits of the current experimental models for human-specific infectious diseases. The expression, localization and conformation of surface structures present on both the host and pathogen play important roles in initiating infection.62, 63 It is well established that the expression and localization of a variety of surface markers can be altered when cells are cultured in 3-D relative to their 2-D counterparts, with the former condition often closely reflecting the in vivo-scenario.4, 10, 12, 64, 65 Moreover, it has been previously shown in both 3-D10 and 2-D66 cultures that the co-culture of epithelial cells and macrophages can lead to alterations in the expression of cell surface proteins. Thus the large decrease we observed in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression and/or localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of macrophages with the epithelial cells. It was shown previously that CFTR is an important receptor for Typhi.42, 43 We hypothesized that the inclusion of activated macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model could lead to altered localization and/or expression of the CFTR receptor in a manner that could explain the drastic decrease in Typhi adherence between the epithelial and co-culture models relative to the Typhimurium serovars. However, under the conditions of this study we observed no differences by immunohistochemical profiling in its localization or expression between the two models. Another alterative explanation is that the Typhi strain was killed at higher levels than the NTS strains by the either the macrophages, the epithelial cells, or both. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to investigate the mechanistic basis for these differences. We were particularly interested in applying our 3-D organoid models to study the colonization characteristics of ST313 strain D23580 relative to the ‘classic’ Typhimurium and Typhi strains SL1344 and Ty2, respectively. D23580, a representative ST313 clinical isolate, has undergone genome reduction similar to that of other human-restricted serovars like Typhi.32 ST313 strains are often referred to as ‘highly invasive’, as they are predominantly recovered from the bloodstream of patients.32, 35, 50, 67, 68 However, results from research into the invasiveness and survival of ST313 relative to classic Salmonella strains using in vitro models have been somewhat contradictory.36, 50, 69, 70 Animal studies by our lab and others have indicated that gastrointestinal colonization by ST313 (including D23580) is low, with rapid spread to systemic tissues.34, 35 In our current study, we found that D23580 invaded both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models at significantly lower levels than SL1344 (Fig. 3B). When we evaluated the survival of each strain relative to the number of invaded bacteria, D23580 replicated/survived better than either SL1344 or Ty2 in both of the 3-D models (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that D23580 may spread more efficiently throughout the infected host relative to classic Typhimurium due to its inherent intracellular survival properties rather than an ability to invade at higher levels. Additional possibilities to explain the enhanced recovery of D23580 at 24 h include, (1) heterogenous populations of intracellular bacteria that are in different physiological states (including viable but not culturable organisms, or populations where the majority of bacteria have reached stationary phase), and (2) host cells that have been lysed by infection, thereby precluding the recovery of released bacteria during plating for viable cfu in gentamicin assays. The 3-D co-culture and epithelial models could also distinguish between the Salmonella pathovars grown under limited oxygen. As facultative anaerobes, salmonellae encounter and respond to a wide range of oxygen levels both in the environment and in vivo. Studies have reported that limiting oxygen conditions increase the adherence and invasiveness of Salmonella when used to infect pure monolayer cultures of either epithelial cells or macrophages.71–73 We did not find that low oxygen increased the adherence or invasiveness of any of the strains tested using either of our highly differentiated 3-D cell culture models when data were normalized to the initial inoculum, although Typhi did display an upward trend in adherence in the 3-D epithelial model following microaerobic culture (p = 0.07, Supplementary Fig. S3C). When invasion data were analyzed relative to the number of bacteria that had adhered, we found microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2, yet had no effect on ST313 strain D23580 in the epithelial model (Fig. 4). However, in the co-culture model a different trend was observed: SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen-related differences in invasion, while microaerobic culture enhanced invasion of D23580 that had adhered to the model. The enhanced invasive capabilities of D23580 pre-adapted to low oxygen was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model (the more reductionist model; Fig. 4), nor was it observed when the data were analyzed as a percentage of the initial inoculum. These results suggest that although low oxygen may not increase the ability for D23580 to adhere to the host, the bacteria that are able attach are able to invade or be taken up at higher levels than when they are pre-adapted to higher oxygen conditions. Moreover, this enhanced invasion/uptake was only observed in the 3-D co-culture model, indicating that the macrophages play a key role in this increased invasion phenotype either directly through increased uptake of D23580 or indirectly through cross talk to the epithelium. Intriguingly, although microaerobic culture enhanced the invasiveness of D23580 that had adhered, it did not enhance the survival of those that invaded as much as when the bacteria were cultured aerobically (Fig. 5B). This difference was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model for D23580 grown under the two oxygen conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). One advantage of using a multicellular in vitro host model system is the ability to visualize the co-localization patterns of each strain relative to the different host cell types. We found that each of the Salmonella pathovars displayed distinct patterns in their clustering and host cell specificity (Fig. 6). Regardless of the model being infected (3-D co-culture or epithelial), SL1344-infected cells were abundant in samples imaged at the intracellular survival/replication time point (24 h.p.i.), with the bacteria forming dense intracellular clusters within infected cells. D23580 formed more punctate patterns with occasional intracellular clustering and what appeared to be lower numbers of bacteria relative to SL1344- or Ty2-infected models. Although Ty2-infected cells were more difficult to find relative to SL1344 and D23580, when infected cells were found (epithelial cells or macrophages), they were completely packed full of bacteria. These distinct phenotypes observed may be related, in part, to differences in the survival and/or dissemination strategies between the three strains. During S. enterica infections, bacteria grow within cells and are subsequently re-distributed among nearby uninfected cells in order to form new infection foci that become pathological lesions.74–77 There is a heterogeneous expansion within tissues, with most phagocytes displaying low bacterial numbers and small number heavily infected.74, 76–78 It has been previously shown in mice that Salmonella strains defective in SPI-2 are still able to grow to high intracellular densities, but have difficulty exiting the cells and re-distributing within tissues, leading to a lower net growth within organs and higher bacterial loads for the small numbers of infected cells.78 This phenotype resembles what we observed with Typhi in our human 3-D organotypic models. Several SPI-2 effectors present in Typhimurium are missing (sseI, gogB, spvB, spvC, sseK1, sseK2, and sseK3) or inactivated (sopD2 and sseJ) in Typhi.52–54, 79, 80 These differences may lead to different dissemination strategies between the serovars in human tissues; an intriguing prospect that will be investigated using these models in future studies. We also observed that the oxygen condition under which the bacteria had been cultured prior to the start of the infection altered the host cell co-localization distribution pattern between epithelial cells and macrophages (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S5). When SL1344 was cultured aerobically, it was very difficult to locate any macrophages in the co-culture model at 24 h.p.i., suggesting that SL1344 may have induced apoptosis in these cells; a phenotype previously observed in SL1344-infected macrophages.30, 50, 70, 81 In contrast, macrophages were found in D23580- and Ty2-infected models, with both strains co-localizing with intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages when the bacteria were cultured aerobically. These findings are in agreement with reports showing that SL1344 induces higher levels of apoptosis in macrophages than Typhi30, 70, 81 and ST313 strains50, 70 when cultured under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, when SL1344 was cultured under low oxygen conditions, macrophages were readily found within the model, some of which contained bacteria while others were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d ). Likewise, we found more empty macrophages in the model when D23580 and Ty2 were cultured microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panels e and f). Possible explanations for these infection patterns following culture of the bacteria under low oxygen conditions prior to infection include: (1) pathogen avoidance of macrophages, (2) specific targeting of epithelial cells, (3) enhanced intracellular killing within macrophages, and/or (4) a masking effect whereby the macrophages are unable to detect the pathogen, leading to lower levels of uptake. When we compared our co-culture imaging results at 24 h to the co-culture colonization data at the same time point (Fig. 5B), both SL1344 and D23580 displayed an ~2-fold decrease (p < 0.05) in replication/survival when the bacteria were cultured under oxygen-limiting conditions relative to aerobic cultures. However, Ty2 displayed no significant differences in replication/survival between the two oxygen conditions (Fig. 5). Future studies will focus on further investigating the mechanisms underlying these differences.Conclusions In summary, the 3-D co-culture model of human colonic epithelium in combination with immune cells that was engineered, validated and tested in this study represents a new tool to investigate mechanisms underlying enteric diseases with both non-infectious and infectious etiologies, including salmonellosis. Phagocytic macrophages were incorporated in the model in order to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity and structure of the parental tissue, thereby allowing for synergistic contributions of different cell types during infection to be assessed so that host-pathogen interactions can be studied in a more physiologically relevant context. In addition, we also demonstrated that this model could be used for investigations into the impact of different environmental parameters on colonization as well as co-localization patterns of pathogens with different host cell types. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related models with increasing complexity to study infectious disease mechanisms. Using this approach, we identified key microenvironmental factors (i.e., host multicellular complexity and oxygen) important for regulating pathovar-specific invasion and host co-localization properties. We continue to enhance the physiological relevance of these models by incorporation of additional cell types that are normally found in the tissue in vivo, including the use of primary cells, dendritic cells, B cells and T cells, which will continue to advance our mechanistic understanding of enteric infectious disease in the context of the host-microenvironment.Materials and methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 and D23580, S. Typhi Ty2, and E. coli HB101 were used in this study. Bacterial cultures were initiated under aerobic conditions in Lennox broth (LB) overnight with aeration (180 rpm) at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 into fresh LB. For microaerobic studies, LB media was pre-flushed with a mixed gas comprised of 2% O2, 6% CO2, and 92% N2 and inoculations took place within a Coy chamber which was maintained using the same gas mixture. Oxygen levels in the chamber were monitored by an O2 sensor and remained between 2.1–2.4% for the duration of the culture. Both aerobic and microaerobic cultures were grown at 37 °C and 180 rpm to late log phase, and immediately thereafter used for infection assays. To confirm bacterial strains were at the same phase of growth, growth curves were performed under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions by plating for viable colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) and measuring the corresponding OD600 (data not shown).Human cell lines and culture conditions The human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 and the human monocytic cell line U93782 were obtained from ATCC (HTB-38 and CRL-1593.2, respectively). These cell lines were chosen for this study as both represent model cell types commonly used to study Salmonella-host interactions, and thus there is extensive published literature for comparison. Moreover, U937 cells are well suited for this study, as they can be differentiated into adherent phagocytic cells that exhibit many key morphological and functional properties of macrophages, including phagocytosis. GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Life Technologies), 2.5 mg/L ITS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.25 g/L sodium bicarbonate was used for all studies, and cells were maintained at 37 °C, 10% CO2. HT-29 cells were initiated as monolayers and U937 cells as a suspension culture, the latter of which was maintained at the recommended cell density of 2 × 105–2 × 106 cells/mL. U937 cells (1 × 107) were added to 0.25 g porous Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) (10−8 M) was added to GTSF-2 to induce characteristics of terminally differentiated macrophages.83 The mix was evenly distributed into 6-well plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 10% CO2. Following incubation, PMA-differentiated U937 cells bound to microcarrier beads were gently rinsed with GTSF-2 media and combined with HT-29 cells (2 × 106). Cultures were loaded into the RWV, which was then filled completely with culture media, and bubbles removed. Cultures were incubated statically for 15–30 min. prior to initiating rotation (20 rpm), monitored daily and small bubbles removed if observed. GTSF-2 was replenished after the first 4–5 days and then every 24 h thereafter until the harvest of cultures at 15–16 days. The 3-D HT-29 epithelial cultures17 served as controls and were grown in parallel with the 3-D co-culture model for all studies.Bead uptake assays The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed as previously described,10, 84 based on uptake of bacteria-sized (2 µM) Fluoresbrite YG Microspheres (Polysciences). Briefly, 3-D aggregates (2 × 106 cells) of either the co-culture or epithelial model were incubated with 108 fluorescent beads for 30 min at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in 6-well plates (5 mL medium). Following incubation, the aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with cold Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen) to remove non-phagocytosed beads and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Following a 30-minute incubation, aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS and further processed for imaging with CLSM as described below.Infection studies Upon reaching optimal differentiation as determined by immunohistochemical profiling, 3-D cell culture models were harvested from the RWV, assayed for viability, and seeded into multi-well plates to a final density of ~1 × 106 cells/well. A gentamicin protection assay was then performed as described previously.7, 17 Briefly, bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 10. Samples were plated for viable CFU/mL for adherence (30 min), invasion (3 h) and intracellular survival (24 h). For each time point, host cells were washed 2–3 times with HBSS, lysed with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and serial dilutions of the lysate plated on LB agar to assess CFU per mL. Gentamicin was added after the 30-min (50 µg/mL) and 3 h (10 µg/mL) time points in order to eliminate remaining extracellular bacteria. Percent adherence was calculated by normalizing the CFU/mL obtained at 30 min to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Percent invasion and survival/replication were calculated as indicated in the figure legend, either by normalizing to the initial bacterial inoculum or to the total CFU obtained for the previous time point. All statistical comparisons were made in Graphpad using the Student’s t-test (p < 0.05). Two independent biological trials were performed for each experiment, with three technical replicates per trial. Time-matched controls were included for all studies using the non-invasive E. coli strain HB101 and untreated samples (latter for imaging studies).Immunohistochemical profiling Fixation, staining and imaging of 3-D aggregates was performed as previously described.7, 10 Samples were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. For 3-D perspectives, image stacks acquired by CLSM were median filtered using a (3 × 3) kernel for noise reduction and then gamma corrected (gamma 0.75) to compensate for image dynamic range. Processed image stacks for each fluorescence channel were then rendered as 3-D perspective surface using an isovolume filter with the open-source image visualization engine ParaView (Henderson A. 2007. ParaView Guide, A Parallel Visualization Application. Kitware, Inc.). Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (CD45, β-catenin, CD84); Life Technologies (ZO-1, MUC5AC); BioLegend (CD68); Kamiya Biomedical (Sialyl Lewis A); and KPL (Salmonella CSA-1). All antibodies were used at a final dilution of 1:50 in blocking solution (3% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in DPBS) with the exception of anti-β-catenin and anti-Sialyl Lewis A, which were used at a final dilution of 1:100. Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution for detecting primary antibodies, with the exception of anti-CD68 and anti-Salmonella CSA-1, which were FITC-conjugated. For dual labeling purposes with CD45 and MUC5AC, a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used that was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies).Electronic supplementary material Supplementary Figure S1 (4.8MB, tif) Supplementary Figure S2 (240KB, tif) Supplementary Figure S3 (310.9KB, tif) Supplementary Figure S4 (165.8KB, tif) Supplementary Figure S5 (3.9MB, tif) Supplementary Figure S6 (2.1MB, tif) Supplementary Figure S7 (1.8MB, tif) Acknowledgements We thank Carolyn Coyne for helpful discussions and Debra Baluch for her kind imaging help.

While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models. Collectively, these technologies provide a more physiologically relevant and predictive framework for investigating infectious disease mechanisms and antimicrobial therapies at the intersection of the host, microbe, and their local microenvironments.INTRODUCTION Mucosal surfaces lining the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urogenital tracts continuously interface with the external environment and serve as a barrier against pathogens, commensals, chemicals, drugs, and toxins. These tissues possess a complex architecture with multiple cell types organized into three-dimensional (3-D) structures that facilitate tissue-specific functions. The biological, chemical, and biomechanical characteristics that define microenvironmental niches along these surfaces provide the structure and context in which infection takes place. Pathogens have adapted to detect specific host structures, polarity, and changes in local environmental stimuli (pH, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, physical forces, etc.) to know where and when to activate specific virulence programs during different infection stages (1–7). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating in vivo spatiotemporal properties of dynamic 3-D microenvironments to more accurately model host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Historically, infectious disease has been commonly studied in vitro by assessing the interaction of a single microbe with a single host cell type, with the latter grown as flat 2-D monolayers. This reductionist approach has enabled important discoveries and advanced our understanding of mechanisms that underlie infection and disease. However, the study of disease in isolation or out of context can change the native behavior of both host and microbe, thus creating a barrier for researchers to correlate in vitro and in vivo responses. In this data-rich period where multiple -omics technologies are being synergistically applied for unparalleled insight into host-pathogen interactions, it is critical to consider the context in which these investigations are performed. Reconstructing host microenvironments is key, including 3-D tissue architecture, multicellular complexity, microbiota composition/localization, oxygen tension, transport processes, and biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression) (1, 8–11). Within this context, in vitro models are positioned along a continuum between 2-D and 3-D, with flat monolayers of a single cell type representing the most basic system and more complex models located further down the spectrum that recreate multiple aspects of the native tissue microenvironment (Fig. 1). Since tissues and organs function in a 3-D context, consideration of proper structure is essential for development of models that better mimic in vivo responses. Since no current in vitro model fully accomplishes this task, multidisciplinary teams of biologists, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and clinicians are creatively working together to develop next-generation 3-D models with enhanced predictive capabilities to open new avenues for clinical translation.

(Republished from PLoS One [343].)Present-day 3-D culture techniques result from a series of progressive advances in tissue engineering over the past century to better mimic the native structure and microenvironment of normal and diseased tissues (reviewed in reference 12). Indeed, long ago the cancer research community recognized that appropriate modeling of the 3-D microenvironment is important for mimicking disease, leading to development and application of 3-D organoid models developed within or on top of extracellular matrix (ECM) (12–16). The bidirectional exchange of biological and physical signals between cells and their microenvironment regulates cell structure/function and is largely manifested by tensile connections between ECM, cell surface receptors (e.g., integrins), and the cytoskeleton to transduce signals to and from the nucleus (17–31). This structural network is also engaged by certain invasive pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria, rotavirus, and influenza virus) that hijack and remodel host cell architecture to facilitate their internalization, intracellular trafficking, and/or dissemination (9, 32–34). Similarly, we and others have demonstrated that bacteria also respond to biomechanical forces like fluid shear, which can regulate virulence, gene expression, and/or stress responses (1–5, 35–47). Indeed, the discovery of biomechanical forces as environmental regulators of microbial pathogenesis was made by our team almost 2 decades ago with the finding that fluid shear forces globally reprogram Salmonella gene expression, stress responses, and virulence (35). Fluid shear also plays a central role in regulating a number of host responses, including differentiation (48–50). Although 3-D models have long been applied for cancer research (12–16), they remained largely unincorporated by the infectious disease community until the late 1990s and early 2000s. As expected for many new ideas in an established field, the use of 3-D models to study host-pathogen interactions was initially met with skepticism. The first reports of 3-D models to study viral infections were by Long et al. in 1998 (rhinovirus) and bacterial infections by Nickerson et al. in 2001 (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) (11, 51). Recently, infectious disease researchers have broadly embraced 3-D models for studying pathogenesis mechanisms, for biomarker discovery, and for drug candidate screening. In this review, we highlight key microenvironmental factors to consider when selecting in vitro 3-D intestinal models to study host-pathogen interactions. We focus on three key technologies for model development, (i) the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, (ii) ECM-embedded/organoid models, and (iii) gut-on-a-chip models, and propose a vision for future model advancements. We also provide proper historical context for use of 3-D cell cultures in studying host-pathogen interactions, which is finally gaining a critical mass of scientists who understand and appreciate the value of studying disease in the proper context of tissue form and function.MICROENVIRONMENTAL CUES IN HOST-MICROBE INTERACTIONS Mucosal tissue function and homeostasis are meticulously controlled by complex bidirectional interactions between cells and their microenvironment (15, 20, 25, 27–29, 52–55). The microenvironment includes 3-D tissue architecture, multiple cell types, ECM, innate immunity mediators, indigenous microbiota, and physical forces. These factors are regulatory signals for mucosal pathogens and may be beneficial or detrimental for infection (1–5, 8, 35–45, 47, 56–64). Below we address key cellular, biochemical, and biophysical cues that dictate infection outcome and are important considerations when modeling host-enteric pathogen interactions. Cellular factors. Intestinal mucosal epithelium contains an array of specialized epithelial and immune cells that work in synergy to protect against infection by (i) serving as a barrier against luminal toxins, commensals, and pathogens, (ii) sampling microbial antigens, and (iii) recruiting innate and adaptive immune effectors (65). The intestine contains multiple epithelial cell types, including enterocytes (absorptive functions), enteroendocrine cells (hormone secretion), Paneth cells (antimicrobial production), goblet cells (mucin production), M cells (luminal antigen sampling/induction of mucosal immunity), Tuft cells (Th2 immunity), and cup cells (unknown function) (66, 67). The intestine also contains immune cells for innate and adaptive responses to pathogen attack, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B cells, including those organized in lymphoid structures termed Peyer's patches, sites of induction of mucosal immunity. As the body's largest immune organ, the composition, organization, and function of the intestine vary by region and consist of integrated cross-communication networks of different cell types and effectors critical for protection against pathogens (described in references 59, 65, and 68 to 72). Epithelial cell polarity establishes barrier function, regulates uptake/transport of nutrients, and maintains epithelial architecture (65, 73–75). In the intestine, apical surfaces face the lumen and regions between villi/folds, lateral surfaces face adjacent cells, and basal surfaces face the basement membrane and lamina propria. Along Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles, the basal side of the follicle-associated epithelium overlies a subepithelial dome region containing a mixture of immune cells (76). The distinct biochemical composition (e.g., protein and lipid) of apical and basolateral surfaces facilitates their specific functions (75). Given that many pathogens have evolved to recognize surface-specific molecules for attachment and/or to disrupt barrier integrity to enable their uptake and dissemination (6, 74, 77–79), appropriately modeling polarity in vitro is critical, as pathogens infect host cells differently depending on whether they are polarized or nonpolarized (80–83). Maintaining barrier integrity requires proper expression and localization of tight and adherens junctions. Adherens junctions are mediated by E-cadherin and catenin interactions, while tight junctions are composed of transmembrane proteins (e.g., claudins and occludins) and cytoplasmic plaque proteins (e.g., zonula occludens). While generally protective, junctional complexes are also exploited by pathogens to facilitate invasion (74) and some enteric viruses utilize receptors localized to these junctions (77, 78). Another major cellular component encountered by enteric pathogens is the diverse microbial community—termed microbiota (referring to microorganisms) or microbiome (referring to microbial genomes). The intestinal tract contains prokaryotes, viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes, some of which protect the host against pathogen colonization by a variety of mechanisms, including epithelial cell turnover, mucin synthesis, and triggering bacterial sensors on host cells (84–86). Reciprocal interactions between host and microbiota contribute to tissue function and homeostasis and determine microbiota composition, thereby playing an important role in infection and disease (87). For example, members of the intestinal microbiota regulate production of antimicrobial peptides by Paneth cells (88) and shape immune responses by regulating numbers, subsets, and/or functions of T, B, and myeloid cells (65). Microbiota-induced changes in immunity also determine intestinal microbiota composition (85, 89). The intestinal microbiota is comprised of ∼1014 bacteria (>1,000 species), with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes most abundant (90–93). Interpersonal variation in intestinal microbiome occurs, with each individual carrying a subset of the total known microbiome (94). Temporal and spatial variation occurs throughout the intestinal tract (95, 96). Increasing data suggest a relationship between an imbalanced intestinal microbiome and various diseases, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disorders, and cancer (97). The importance of the gut microbiota to health is highlighted by successful clinical application of fecal microbiota transplants from healthy individuals to patients with recurrent, antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile infections (98–100).Biochemical cues. Mucosal tissues contain an array of small molecules, including innate defense mediators that target pathogens and regulate downstream host defenses. Intestinal mucus harbors compounds from the innate and adaptive systems that protect against microbial insult, including digestive enzymes (e.g., lysozyme), lactoferrin, antimicrobial peptides, complement, and antibodies (e.g., secretory immunoglobulin A [sIgA]) (65). In addition, cells of the innate defense system respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Depending on the pathogen, PRR-mediated signal transduction results in different cellular outcomes (e.g., cell proliferation, apoptosis, antimicrobial peptide production, autophagy, and cytokine secretion). Cytokine production leads to recruitment of innate and adaptive immune effectors to the infection site, representing a bridge between these two arms of immunity (65, 101). Mucins are complex mixtures of high-molecular-weight, glycosylated macromolecules that bind and remove pathogens and their products (7, 101). Enteric pathogens sense and respond to cues within mucus and overcome this barrier to reach underlying epithelium (7). Normal intestinal mucus consists of two layers: an outer layer colonized by microbes and a sterile inner layer (102–104). The composition and thickness of these mucin layers vary throughout intestinal regions to accommodate their different functions and microbial burdens. Within the small intestine, the inner and outer mucosal layers are thinner to facilitate nutrient absorption, with thicker regions found toward the ileum, where microbial burden is heavier (7). In the colon, both layers are thicker to accommodate the burden of several trillion commensals (7). The presence of sIgA and other mucin antimicrobials also serves to reduce bacterial colonization (105). The ECM is another key contributor to tissue homeostasis. The ECM has historically been neglected as a signaling entity, but seminal discoveries have revealed the central role of ECM in regulating tissue architecture/function (20, 53). The ECM is a three-dimensional noncellular scaffold comprised of proteins (e.g., collagens, elastins, laminins, and fibronectins), proteoglycans, and water. Two main types of ECM include (i) interstitial connective tissue matrix, which serves as a cellular scaffold, and (ii) basement membrane matrix, which separates epithelium from interstitium (106, 107). ECM components also serve as ligands for cell receptors like integrins, which transduce physical forces into biological responses (mechanotransduction). Additionally, immune responses are mediated through interactions with the ECM (107, 108). Furthermore, the ECM controls availability/release of growth factors and other signaling molecules (hormones and cytokines) (107). The complexity, composition, and structure of ECM are highly dynamic and specific (as are the biochemical gradients it contains) and depend on tissue type, developmental stage, and health/disease state (107).Biophysical forces. The role of physical forces in cell and tissue development/function is as important as those of genes and biochemical signals (28, 109). Physical forces regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (110, 111). Forces experienced by intestinal cells include fluid shear, pressure (112), and contractile peristalsis of muscles (113). Hydrodynamic calculations suggest that fluid shear forces on the exposed epithelial brush border microvilli are ∼200 times greater than those between microvilli (<0.01 dynes/cm2) (114). The cytoskeleton and its linkage with the ECM play an essential role in enabling cells to sense and respond to biophysical forces. While the governing role of the ECM as a dynamic signaling entity that regulates tissue form/function is now appreciated, it was initially considered a purely static scaffold. However, tissue-specific architecture and function are regulated by the biophysical properties of the ECM (20, 115, 116), which exerts physical influences transduced by cell surface receptors through the cytoskeleton to the nucleus to ultimately alter cellular and molecular properties. These structural networks are critical for regulating cell shape/architecture and have been modeled using the principle of tensegrity, which refers to structures that are stabilized under continuous tension by balancing opposing tension and compression forces (27–29, 31). The integration of biophysical forces across cells and tissues using this structural network regulates a wide range of biological processes (e.g., cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, adhesion, migration, gene expression, and architecture) (8, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29–31, 55, 117). Accordingly, ECM composition and stiffness are critical regulators of cellular responses (118, 119). These properties are continuously remodeled through the process of “dynamic reciprocity” (17, 20, 53, 117), theorized by Bissell in 1982 to explain how signaling between the ECM and nucleus regulates tissue function. This laid the foundation for modern 3-D cell culture approaches used today (20, 107, 120). Not surprisingly, pathogen-ECM interactions play an important role in mediating infection (121–126). In addition to impacting the host, physical forces also globally alter bacterial gene expression, stress responses, and virulence in unexpected ways to contribute to infection (5, 36–40, 47, 62–64).MODELING THE MICROENVIRONMENT: 3-D MODELS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE Several cell culture systems exist for the development and application of 3-D models of human tissues for infectious disease research, including the RWV bioreactor, ECM-embedded scaffolds (e.g., ECM extracts, purified ECM, or synthetic/semisynthetic hydrogels), and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models. The choice of system to use depends on several factors, including the experimental question being addressed, technical complexity, and cost and expertise for model development. Different cell types in the native tissue (including immune cells) can be cocultured in these models to further enhance physiological relevance. Additionally, a single epithelial cell type can spontaneously differentiate into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the parental tissue and undergo self-assembly into tissue-like structures using all of these 3-D technologies. To date, most in vitro infection studies have been performed using cell lines; however, there is a push to develop models using either primary or stem cells to better mimic the native tissue. To explore the integration of different environmental signals in regulating infection, a hierarchical series of increasingly complex 3-D model systems comprised of different cells types can be developed and applied in parallel under differing experimental conditions (e.g., different oxygen tensions and physical forces). RWV-derived 3-D models. The RWV bioreactor is an optimized form of suspension culture that facilitates formation of self-organizing 3-D tissue-like aggregates by allowing cells the spatial freedom to colocalize and self-assemble based on natural affinities within a low-fluid-shear environment (Fig. 1B, panel a) (8, 127). Fluid shear influences cell proliferation, differentiation, morphology, and function (30, 114, 128–140). Models developed within the dynamic RWV environment experience excellent mass transfer of nutrients/wastes and exhibit enhanced structure, differentiation, function, and multicellular complexity relative to 2-D monolayers (11, 80, 141–154). Along these lines, observations from the 1970s showed that flotation of collagen gels led to a more permissive environment for cellular differentiation (12, 155, 156). Moreover, the low-fluid-shear environment in the RWV is also physiologically relevant to that encountered by pathogens in low-shear regions of the infected host, including the intestine (38, 114, 129–131). Accordingly, the RWV is also used to culture pathogens to study the role of fluid shear and mechanotransduction in regulating microbial pathogenesis and host-pathogen/commensal interactions (1, 35–41, 45–47, 62, 64, 145, 157–167). The RWV is among the most extensively used approaches to develop 3-D models to study host-pathogen interactions. It was the first technology used to develop 3-D models for infection studies with bacterial (Salmonella) and viral (rhinovirus) pathogens (11, 51). A range of RWV-derived 3-D models have been developed using cell lines, stem cells, and/or primary cells, including small and large intestine (11, 80, 141, 143, 145, 146, 152, 168–177), lung (144, 147, 178–182), liver (148, 153, 174, 183, 184), bladder (8, 185–187), reproductive tissue (149–151, 188–190), heart (191–193), prostate (142, 186, 194), pancreas (195, 196), nervous tissue (182, 197–199), blood-brain barrier (200), skin (201), eye (202), bone, joint, or disc (203–207), and tonsil (208), among others. These studies demonstrated that RWV-derived models exhibit enhanced in vivo-like characteristics, including spontaneous differentiation into multiple cell types that self-organize into 3-D structures (Fig. 1B, panel d), polarization, appropriate expression/localization of adherens/tight junctional complexes, metabolic product secretion, gene expression, cytokine production, responses to antimicrobials and microbial products, support of commensals, and/or susceptibility to infection (8, 11, 80, 141–153, 168–194, 197–208). In addition, RWV models have been advanced to incorporate immune cells to study their role in host-microbe interactions (171, 175, 177, 180). Models are typically initiated by harvesting monolayers, combining cells with porous ECM-coated microcarrier scaffolds, and loaded into the RWV. Scaffold and ECM porosity allows the basal side of cells to experience autocrine/paracrine communications, aiding cellular differentiation/responses in a manner reflecting in vivo tissues. This differs from monolayers where cells proliferate on impermeable surfaces, thus hindering proper communications across apical and basolateral surfaces. Additionally, models may be developed scaffold free or using nonmicrocarrier scaffolds (e.g., decellularized tissues) for transplantation (179, 181, 209). Once developed, distribution of 3-D models into multiwell plates lends to their experimental tractability for infection assays, as their structural/functional integrity remains intact following seeding. Alternatively, pathogens or compounds can be directly added to the RWV to study interactions under physiological fluid shear. One key advantage of RWV culture is the production of large numbers of cells (∼107 to 108 per culture). Below we discuss RWV-derived 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa.RWV-derived intestinal models. We began using the RWV to engineer 3-D models of human intestine for infection studies in the late 1990s after realizing that available models for studying bacterial pathogenesis lacked multiple aspects of the in vivo microenvironment (11). RWV-derived 3-D models have enabled the study of host-microbe interactions relevant to different regions of the intestinal tract, including the small intestine (11, 169) and colon (80, 143, 145, 146, 152, 171, 172, 175, 177). Imaging of these models revealed enhanced 3-D architecture relative to monolayers, including the presence of extensive 3-D folds and microvilli, that more closely resembled what is observed in vivo (Fig. 1B, panel d). These 3-D models are essentially “inside-out” such that the apical/luminal side faces the media and the basal side faces the scaffold, allowing for straightforward introduction of pathogens, toxins, and antimicrobials at the apical surface, as commonly occurs in vivo. Collectively, these models have shown physiologically relevant expression and localization of key cellular components, including junctional proteins (e.g., ZO-1, occludin, symplekin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and desmosomes), secretion of basal lamina components (e.g., collagen types II, III, and IV, laminin, vimentin, and fibronectin), brush border formation with villin, and/or mucus secretion (11, 80, 143, 145, 146, 152, 169, 171, 172, 175, 177). Spontaneous cellular differentiation into multiple lineages found in the intestinal epithelium is also observed, including enterocytes, M cells, goblet cells, and/or Paneth cells (enteroendocrine cells were not evaluated) (11, 80, 146, 152, 171, 175). The presence of multiple cell types within a model (e.g., epithelial and immune cells) enables study of their combined effects on infection, and in particular, pathogen colocalization patterns with different cell types. An example is described below in which an advanced 3-D RWV coculture model that combined human colonic epithelium with phagocytic macrophages was used to study infection by different Salmonella pathovars (171). Primary human lymphocytes have also been incorporated in a 3-D coculture model of intestinal epithelium to study Salmonella infection (175). RWV-derived intestinal models have contributed to the study of a variety of pathogens, such as S. Typhimurium (including multidrug resistant ST313), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B (CVB) and poliovirus (11, 80, 143, 145, 146, 152, 171, 172, 175). Studies with S. Typhimurium using 3-D models of small and large intestine displayed marked differences from monolayers in colonization, tissue morphology, apoptosis, and prostaglandin and cytokine expression (11, 80, 152). The responses of these 3-D intestinal models to S. Typhimurium challenge were highly predictive of in vivo responses in humans/animals (11, 80, 152), including rapid repair of the small intestine (initial site of Salmonella pathogenesis) and significant damage to the colon (primary site of pathogenesis) (210). These models were also the first in vitro systems to challenge the widely accepted paradigm established using monolayers that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is required for invasion of intestinal epithelium (80, 152). Historically, studies with monolayers contradicted in vivo observations wherein successful animal infections were possible with T3SS SPI-1 mutants (211, 212), and clinical isolates of Salmonella lacking SPI-1 function were isolated from foodborne disease outbreaks in patients experiencing gastroenteritis (213). Using a 3-D intestinal model comprised solely of epithelial cells, Radtke et al. demonstrated that SPI-1 mutants and a Salmonella mutant lacking all known T3SSs (SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar system) still exhibited high levels of invasion relative to the wild type (although approximately 0.5 to 1 log lower) (152). As expected, in monolayers these mutants exhibited little to no invasion (<10 CFU), a finding which does not reflect in vivo observations (152). Thus, for the first time, an in vitro intestinal epithelial model was able to parallel in vivo results by supporting Salmonella invasion independently of SPI-1. These findings demonstrate the enhanced capability of RWV models to predict in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms. Host-pathogen-commensal and host-commensal interactions have also been investigated using RWV 3-D intestinal models (172, 177). Commensal microbes naturally enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function against pathogen colonization through complex mechanisms not yet fully characterized (214). Naturally occurring probiotic strains of bacteria are being exploited as a strategy against pathogens to combat ongoing problems of antibiotic resistance. Treatment of a 3-D intestinal model with Lactobacillus reuteri or its antimicrobial metabolite, reuterin, before or after challenge with S. Typhimurium reduced adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival of this pathogen compared to findings for untreated cells (172). This was the first study to report the effect of reuterin on the enteric infection process for any mammalian cell type. A 3-D intestinal coculture model containing immune cells was used to profile responses to both free secretory IgA (sIgA) and sIgA complexed with a commensal strain of E. coli (177). Application of free sIgA to the model induced upregulation of MUC2, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) secretion. When sIgA was complexed with E. coli and applied to the model, these responses were downregulated relative to models treated with free sIgA. Barrila et al. reported advancement of a 3-D HT-29 colon model to include phagocytic macrophages, thereby improving its physiological relevance to study aspects of the innate immune response to infection (171). Characterization of this coculture model revealed macrophages integrated between and underneath epithelial cells while preserving epithelial tight junctions and the presence of multiple epithelial cell types, including enterocytes, M cells, and goblet cells (171). Macrophage phagocytosis was confirmed by evaluating their ability to engulf inert, bacterium-sized beads. The contribution of macrophages to Salmonella infection was assessed using S. enterica pathovars with differing host tropisms and disease phenotypes, including the well-studied sequence type 19 (ST19) S. Typhimurium strain SL1344, which causes disease in a wide range of hosts, the multidrug-resistant ST313 S. Typhimurium strain D23580, and the human-specific S. Typhi strain Ty2. Although classified as S. Typhimurium, ST313 strains display genome degradation similar to that of human-adapted S. Typhi and are associated with devastating epidemics of blood-borne infections in sub-Saharan Africa (215). Bacteria were cultured aerobically or microaerobically prior to infection to simulate oxygen environments encountered before and during intestinal infection. Colonization of all strains was reduced in the coculture model containing macrophages relative to the epithelial model, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Although ST313 strains are considered highly invasive due to the systemic infection they cause, D23580 was not highly invasive in the 3-D models but instead exhibited enhanced survival/replication, thus providing clues as to what drives this organism's pathogenicity. Pathovar- and oxygen-specific differences in host cell colocalization patterns were also observed (Fig. 1B, panel g), indicating the ability of these advanced models to distinguish between closely related Salmonella serovars, thus providing a unique advantage over models composed of a single cell type (171). RWV-derived intestinal models are also valuable for investigating host-pathogen interactions for which conventional cultivation strategies are unable to adequately model in vivo complexity. Recently, a 3-D colonic model was applied to study human CVB (146), a pathogen for which in vitro and in vivo models may not fully model the enteral infection route in humans (146, 216–219). Comparisons between polarized 2-D and 3-D cells revealed that the 3-D model displayed an enhanced number of viral particles secreted into the media at early stages of the viral life cycle, which did not coincide with increased host cell destruction relative to monolayers (146). These data suggest that 3-D models exhibit an enhancement in nonlytic release of viral particles, which might result from morphological changes (e.g., enhanced brush border formation) in 3-D cells. Similarly, another 3-D colonic model was used to study Cryptosporidium parvum, a parasite for which there is a lack of physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models (143). Following C. parvum infection, morphological changes were observed that were consistent with those from colonic biopsy specimens of infected patients (143). These studies further emphasize the critical importance of model complexity and physiological relevance as determinants in enabling host-pathogen interactions. In summary, 3-D RWV intestinal models are powerful tractable research tools that advance the study of host-pathogen interactions. These models can be modularly altered to incorporate different cell types (including patient-derived cells), ECM, commensal microbiota, physical forces, etc., akin to in vivo scenarios, increasing their relevance. Their tissue-like architecture, differentiation and polarization, enhanced expression/localization of junctional proteins, and mucin production are necessary components of an effective barrier to invading pathogens.Limitations and future directions of RWV-derived 3-D models. Although many key structural/functional characteristics of parental tissues have been successfully recapitulated using RWV models, several limitations remain. The full extent of 3-D architecture, multicellular complexity, and array of physical forces of in vivo tissues has not yet been attained. Ongoing studies are further enhancing these features, plus incorporating patient-specific immune cells and fecal microbiota, and achieving vascularization and innervation. Models can be costly due to high medium consumption required for culturing large numbers of cells; however, researchers can scale down. Although bead porosity facilitates apical/basal cytokine secretion and there is excellent access to the apical side of the models, there is currently an inability to sample the basal side. This also prevents measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which measures electrical resistance across a monolayer as a proxy for assessing barrier integrity (220). The technique involves using two electrodes, one in contact with cells on a semipermeable membrane (e.g., apical side) and the other in a different chamber containing culture medium (e.g., basal side). With most RWV models grown on tiny (∼175 μm) microcarrier beads, these measurements are not currently possible with off-the-shelf technology. This challenge will likely be surmounted with custom electrode design to accommodate current RWV models or the use of alternative scaffolds. Currently, immunofluorescence imaging of cytoskeletal and tight junctional markers represents an alternative method to evaluate model integrity. As these models grow in size and complexity, introduction of vasculature and nerve cells will be important. Finally, current models are not easily amenable to chronic infection due to lack of perfusion once removed from the RWV; however, inclusion of automated waste removal and nutrient delivery during infection will facilitate this approach.3-D organoid models. The term organoid (“organ-like”) has been used to describe a variety of 3-D models that resemble in vivo tissues. Historically, this included models engineered with different technologies using cell lines, stem cells, primary cells, or tissue explants either embedded in or cultured on top of ECM scaffolds that allow cells to self-assemble into 3-D structures (8, 12, 143, 145, 146, 169, 171, 221–229). Advances in stem cell biology led to a recent terminology shift to more specifically define organoids as 3-D models derived from stem cells, progenitor cells, or primary explants (222, 230–238). Here we focus on 3-D models cultured within a 3-D ECM that fit this definition. It is important to emphasize that current models are based on decades of work by pioneering cell biologists that laid the foundation for the current organoid field (reviewed in reference 12), representing an advancement and merging of old and new technologies to enable novel discoveries (12, 228, 239). Models cultivated using thick ECMs have deep roots in tissue engineering and cancer biology, in which they were applied to develop advanced models enabling the study of a variety of biological mechanisms, particularly with regard to understanding the interrelationship between tissue structure and function (12). This effort resulted in a critical mass of scientists who now recognize the importance of 3-D models for infection and are bringing elegant advances to the field but may not be fully aware of their historical context. A range of different organoid models have been established, including small and large intestine (229, 230, 232, 234, 240–268), lung (269–274), stomach (275–282), breast (55, 283, 284), brain (285–287), liver (222, 288, 289), pancreas (222, 290, 291), gallbladder (292), eye (293), kidney (294), prostate (222, 295, 296) and reproductive tract (297, 298), among others. Relative to monolayers, these models more closely mimic endogenous tissues, including organization and spontaneous differentiation of multiple cell types into physiologically relevant 3-D structures (Fig. 1B, panel e), expression and localization of tight junctions, mucus production, polarity, gene expression, cell viability and proliferation, cytokine production, responses to antimicrobials, support of commensals, and susceptibility to infection (12, 55, 222, 226, 228–235, 237, 238, 240–266, 269–319). To develop 3-D organoid models, stem cells or tissue explants containing stem cells are used. Biopsy specimens may be treated with a dissociation agent and/or mechanically disrupted prior to embedding into ECM. Stem cells isolated from biopsy specimens can be predifferentiated into progenitor cells and further differentiated into ECM-embedded organoids. Differentiation into committed cell types is enabled by stepwise supplementation and/or removal of signaling factors during culture (249, 251, 252, 254, 264, 275, 278, 303, 320–322). Purified ECM components and mixtures can be used, including Matrigel, a laminin-rich ECM isolated from chondrosarcomas (323, 324). Synthetic hydrogels help circumvent challenges associated with Matrigel, including batch-to-batch variation and potential carcinogenic issues connected with tumor-derived matrices (229).3-D intestinal organoids. Sato et al. (249) and Ootani et al. (253) independently reported conditions enabling long-term in vitro culture of mouse intestinal crypts containing Lgr5+ stem cells (as well as purified Lgr5+ stem cells that generate villus/crypt-like structures [249]). These approaches used either Matrigel (249) or collagen (253) in combination with supplementation of Wnt agonist R-spondin 1. Sato et al. also included epidermal growth factor to enable crypt growth and noggin to facilitate passaging (249). These models displayed a polarized, multicellular epithelium (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells) organized into a central lumen lined by villus/crypt-like structures (249, 253). Murine intestinal organoids developed from single Lgr5+ stem cells also developed into these multicellular structures (249). Subsequently, additional factors were included to enable human colonoid culture (264). The  Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium defined a standardized nomenclature to reflect model sources, approaches, and in vitro structures (325). Structures directly isolated include epithelial sheets, crypts, and organoids (crypts and surrounding mesenchymal elements) (325). Various structures produced in vitro from small intestine include enterospheres (rounded epithelial cyst-like structures), enteroids (formation of budding crypts from enterospheres), and induced intestinal organoids (multicellular clusters from induced embryonal or pluripotent stem cells, e.g., induced human intestinal organoids [iHIOs]) (325). Analogous colonic structures include colonospheres, colonoids, and colonic organoids (325). It is common to see terms used interchangeably, and the nomenclature will likely evolve as the field expands. Model infection can be accomplished by (i) addition of pathogen directly to the media (basal side), (ii) microinjection into the lumen (Fig. 1B, panel b), (iii) shearing of models into fragments followed by pathogen addition, and (iv) complete disruption of 3-D models into flat monolayers followed by pathogen addition (230, 237). Consideration of the normal infection route is critical. Direct addition to the media is easiest; however, for pathogens that infect via the apical/luminal side, this represents a nonphysiological route of infection. Microinjection is technically challenging but preferable for pathogens that normally infect from the lumen. Due to challenges associated with microinjection, there is a growing tendency to mechanically dissociate organoids into smaller pieces or completely dissociate them into monolayers on Transwell inserts or plastic (237, 261, 281, 313, 314). This approach has been successful for a number of studies, including cultivation of norovirus (314), a major advance in the field. Use of Transwell inserts also facilitates TEER analysis and easier cytokine sampling from the apical side of the model. When dissociating 3-D models prior to infection, it is important to note that this disconnects their form and function, similar to disrupting primary tissue into monolayers, and may render them less predictive for some (not all) phenotypes. In this approach, Transwell inserts are preferable over plastic, as the former display improved physiological relevance over conventional monolayers (326). Additional profiling should confirm the extent to which the dissociated model may have dedifferentiated and additional culture time may be required to reestablish polarity/barrier function. Key findings should be validated using intact organoids and microinjection to avoid artifacts. Additionally, since ECM-pathogen interactions are important for infection dynamics (61), infection surfaces should not contain ECM components not typically found in that location in vivo (e.g., lumen) if the pathogen would not normally encounter it. A variety of pathogens have been studied using 3-D enteroid/colonoid/organoid models, including Salmonella, C. difficile, EHEC, EPEC, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), norovirus, rotavirus, enteroviruses, Toxoplasma gondii, and coronaviruses (230, 231, 233–235, 238, 240–245, 257–263, 266, 268, 307–319, 327). The first infection using iHIOs was performed using human rotavirus, which lacks robust in vitro culture systems (315). Both laboratory and clinical rotaviruses replicated in iHIOs and were detected in epithelial and mesenchymal cells (315). Crypt-derived enteroids also supported rotavirus replication and were used to assess antiviral efficacy against patient isolates (244, 266). Ettayebi et al. made a significant advance by the successful in vitro culture of human norovirus (HuNoV), known for its lack of a reproducible culture system (314). The authors initially cultured 3-D intestinal organoids and then dissociated them into monolayers on plastic or Transwell inserts (314). Successful viral replication was observed and only enterocytes were infected with HuNoVs, regardless of the strain or the intestinal region from which the model was derived. Additional viral models, including those using enteroviruses (e.g., CVB, echovirus 11, and enterovirus 71) have identified the cell-type-specific nature of these infections and the virus-specific nature of innate immune signaling in response to infection (327). Enteroid models were also used to study S. Typhimurium and E. coli. Zhang et al. (240) and Wilson et al. (243) used crypt-derived enteroids to study Salmonella infection. S. Typhimurium successfully colonized the model (240, 243), and infection responses aligned well with in vivo observations, including disruption of tight junctions, inflammatory responses, and decreased stem cell numbers (240). Forbester et al. infected iHIOs with S. Typhimurium and observed physiological transcriptomic and cytokine profiles (257). Injection of E. coli O157:H7 into iHIOs containing neutrophils led to loss of actin, epithelial integrity disruption, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil recruitment (Fig. 1B, panel h) (260). In contrast, commensal E. coli was retained within the lumen, with no loss of model integrity. Infection of colonoid-derived Transwell models identified MUC2 and protocadherin-24 as early EHEC infection targets (261). Colonoids were initially cultured in 3-D, followed by dissociation onto Transwells. Model differentiation correlated with expression of differentiation markers, increased TEER, and microvilli (261). EHEC preferentially colonized the differentiated model relative to an undifferentiated control, reducing colonic mucus and inducing damage to microvilli. A similar approach was applied to study EPEC and ETEC infections in coculture models containing macrophages (313). Inclusion of macrophages in the bottom chamber of the enteroid-derived Transwell model enhanced barrier function, increased epithelial height, and altered cytokine responses relative to the control. EPEC increased total macrophage numbers and induced projections that extended into the epithelium, while ETEC induced macrophage extensions across the epithelium to the apical surface. The presence of macrophages in the coculture model enhanced barrier function and correlated with decreased numbers of ETEC organisms relative to the model lacking immune cells. iHIOs were also used to study C. difficile infection (CDI) (258, 259, 262, 263). CDI patients secrete acidic mucus consisting primarily of MUC1, with decreased MUC2 and altered oligosaccharide composition relative to that in healthy patients (259). Injection of the pathogen alone into iHIOs decreased MUC2, while whole CDI stool supernatant was required to induce patient-like oligosaccharide composition changes (259). iHIOs were also used to investigate nontoxigenic and toxigenic strains of C. difficile and purified toxins TcdA and TcdB (262). Injection of the toxigenic isolate or purified TcdA led to a loss of barrier function, while iHIOs injected with the nontoxigenic strain remained intact. Separately, colonoids helped identify Frizzled proteins as receptors for the TcdB toxin (263). In summary, 3-D organoid models are advancing mechanistic understanding of host-microbe interactions due to their enhanced 3-D architecture and presence of Lgr5+ stem cells together with multiple cell types and other functional properties. In addition, patient organoid “biobanks” have been established and are facilitating fundamental research and clinical applications (230, 231, 328, 329). One exciting example of the applicability of these models is the use of patient-derived organoids to predict drug responses for cystic fibrosis treatment (222, 231, 250, 307, 329, 330).Limitations and future directions of 3-D organoids. As for other models, organoids have limitations that researchers are working to overcome. Variability and quality control challenges between experimental preparations includes (i) heterogeneity in size, shape, and viability of organoids within a culture and across different samples, (ii) batch-to-batch variability in Matrigel or other ECM, and (iii) batch-to-batch variability in growth factor sources. Organoid infection presents challenges as described above. Medium cost is high if scaling up due to reliance on specific growth factors. Incorporation of the full array of cell types found in vivo, including the diverse collection of immune cells and microbiota, has not been attained. Organoid models also lack spontaneous M cell formation (251, 331). Pretreatment of in vitro models with RANKL, exposure to lymphocytes, or infection with pathogens like S. Typhimurium can induce M cell formation (331–333). Although the mechanism by which M cells spontaneously differentiate in RWV models (11, 152, 171, 175) is unknown, it is possible that the low-fluid-shear suspension culture environment is important, since flotation of ECM scaffolds was more permissive for differentiation than surface-attached ECM (12, 155, 156). Since organoid models are typically ECM embedded, another limitation is that the application of the range of biomechanical forces found in vivo is limited; however, an iHIO model containing functional neurons that enabled peristalsis-like contractions was reported (256). Combinations of technologies, including organoid-derived 3-D models developed using the RWV bioreactor (202) and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) (334), are further expanding these capabilities. TEER measurements are also not currently possible with intact organoid models due to their size and structure and because they are ECM embedded. Some studies have dissociated organoids into 2-D on Transwells to facilitate these measurements, although there can be disadvantages to using this approach, as discussed.Organ-on-a-chip models. Advanced microfluidic and microfabrication technologies are being broadly applied to develop organ-on-a-chip models that mimic key aspects of in vivo microenvironments. Rather than focusing on recreating the 3-D structure of the entire tissue, this technology aims to recreate a microscale model of the local 3-D architecture and spatial distribution of dynamic tissue interfaces to mimic tissue- and organ-level functions (335). These devices are designed with micrometer-sized fluidic channels separated by thin, flexible porous membranes that enable development of different tissues in adjacent chambers while retaining their ability to interact (Fig. 1B, panel c) (335–339). These features allow flexibility to model active processes within a tissue, such as vascular-like perfusion. One exciting functional feature engineered into the design of many of these devices is the capability to apply dynamic forces across the tissue to model fluid shear and peristalsis (334, 340–343). OAC models vary in complexity, ranging from simple systems containing a single perfused chamber and cell type to more advanced chips that contain several microchannels, membranes, and assorted cell types, thereby allowing the reconstruction of multiple tissue interfaces (335). Microengineering techniques for these devices have been extensively reviewed (335, 338, 344–349). Chips are commonly made of a silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is compatible with many cell types and has several advantages, including optical transparency for easy imaging, low cost, flexibility, and high gas permeability (335, 339, 344, 350). PDMS does carry some disadvantages (discussed below), so other options are being explored (350, 351). Depending on experimental requirements, chip design and approaches for tissue development can be altered. Porous membranes can be coated with a variety of matrices/scaffolds (335, 339, 344, 345, 352). Moreover, 3-D bioprinting techniques are facilitating complex spatial patterning of cells and scaffolds (352). Although traditional electrodes used for TEER measurements do not accommodate the small culture area of most OAC models (220), recent studies have integrated custom electrodes (353). A variety of OAC platforms have been derived from cell lines, stem cells, and/or primary cells, including small and large intestine (334, 340–342, 353–356), lung (357–361), liver (362–369), kidney (370–372), heart (373–377), cornea (378), skin (379), nervous tissue (380–383), bone (384, 385), reproductive tract (386), and blood/endothelium and blood-brain barrier (387–393), among others. Once developed, these models typically retain their structural and functional integrity for several weeks (model specific), further lending to their experimental tractability. Similar to the other 3-D models discussed, OAC models exhibit in vivo-like characteristics, including spontaneous differentiation into multiple cell types, polarity/barrier function, formation of local 3-D structures (Fig. 1B, panel f), responses to biophysical forces, cytokine production, gene expression, mucus production, responses to nanoparticles and drugs, support of commensals, responses to microbial components (e.g., LPS), and/or susceptibility to microbial infections (334, 335, 339–342, 354–377, 379–394). The application of physical forces across several of these models alters physiological responses, including changes in expression/localization of tight junctions, barrier integrity/function, polarity and differentiation, cell viability, size, morphology, ECM production, integrin expression, enzyme activity, cytokine responses, chemical/gas exchange gradients, molecular transport, drug responses, bacterial colonization, virion-related cytopathic effects, and/or formation of 3-D structures (e.g., villi) (334, 340–343, 345, 358, 359, 361, 371, 372, 376, 377, 384, 387, 388, 395). Importantly, several models have been advanced to incorporate immune cells (342, 359, 396). Below we discuss examples of gut-on-a-chip models that have been applied to study pathogens or commensals.Gut-on-a-chip models. The Ingber laboratory developed a series of “mechanically active” gut-on-a-chip models and applied them to study host-microbe interactions (340, 342, 343). They initially constructed a PDMS chip containing two microfluidic channels separated by a flexible, porous ECM-coated membrane (340). Colonic cells were seeded in the upper channel under low-fluid-shear stress (0.006 to 0.06 dyne/cm2), and medium also flowed in the bottom chamber. The chip was engineered with dual vacuum chambers on either side of the main microchamber to enable application of a physiological cyclic strain across the membrane to mimic intestinal peristalsis. This led to a highly polarized columnar epithelium and spontaneous formation of 3-D villus-like folds with basal proliferative cells in the crypt region. Model characterization revealed well-formed tight junctions, mucus production, and multiple intestinal epithelial cell types (absorptive, goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) (340, 341). The ability of this model to support commensal colonization was assessed using Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG. Colonization of LGG improved barrier function and was supported for greater than a week without impacting model integrity, consistent with previous in vivo observations for probiotics. The model was also applied to study host-virus interactions using CVB (Fig. 1B, panel i) (343). Exposure of CVB to the apical surface led to successful viral replication, induction of cytopathic effects (CPE), and polarized (apical) release of proinflammatory cytokines. Infection of the basal side led to decreased viral titers and lower CPE, with apical secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The above-described gut-on-a-chip model was further advanced to include immune cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) and/or endothelial cells (vascular or lymphatic) (342). This combination of models enabled exploration of the interplay between these factors (and others) in bacterial overgrowth and inflammation in the onset of intestinal injury. Synergistic effects between PBMCs and either nonpathogenic E. coli, pathogenic enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to altered barrier function and changes in villus architecture. Similarly, the presence of both PBMCs and LPS led to polarized secretion of basal proinflammatory cytokines, which stimulates recruitment of additional immune cells in an in vivo scenario. Exposure of the PBMC-containing model to a therapeutic formulation of probiotic bacteria increased barrier function. The formulation reduced EIEC-induced intestinal damage in the model lacking PBMCs but in the presence of immune cells only delayed injury onset. Cessation of cyclic stretching led to enhanced bacterial overgrowth, even under constant medium flow.Limitations and future directions of OAC models. While there are many advantages to OAC models, there are limitations. Many of these models have multiple cell types which exhibit enhanced 3-D architecture; however, the vast array of native heterogeneous cell types found in vivo still need to be incorporated and different laboratories are optimizing ECM composition and structure. Along these lines, to our knowledge, no one has yet reported the presence of M cells in gut-on-a-chip models. There is also a strong push for physically linked multiorgan models, or “humans-on-chips” (338, 397). Another limitation is the PDMS material commonly used for chip construction, which can absorb small hydrophobic molecules and interfere with drug screening and cell signaling analysis (338, 350, 351). There are also risks of uncross-linked PDMS leaching into the culture if the curing process is incomplete, causing cell damage (350, 351). While the small number of cells required can be considered advantageous, in some cases, larger numbers of cells (106, 107) may be required depending on the experiment. Infection studies typically involve many permutations, and it is not uncommon to use several multiwell plates within a single experiment. For example, during colonization assays, samples are harvested at different times and plated for viable bacteria, while others are processed for downstream analyses. Thus, it will be beneficial to incorporate multiple 3-D model systems into infectious disease research depending on the experimental question being addressed, as no single model system is sufficient to address all infectious disease experimental scenarios.CONCLUSIONS Over the past 2 decades, a multidisciplinary consortium of researchers has been creative in developing 3-D intestinal models of increasing complexity that better mimic the biological, chemical, and physical microenvironments of the endogenous tissue for studying host-microbe interactions. These models have been developed using a variety of approaches and are being applied to understand the dynamic relationship between the host, pathogens, and commensals that dictate infection outcome and for development of new treatment/prevention strategies. Collectively, these models have ushered in a new era for infectious disease research by offering predictive in vitro translational platforms. Indeed, the establishment of 3-D intestinal models and their application as human surrogates for infectious disease research have provided specific examples of how the study of microbial pathogenesis can be advanced by using appropriate, biologically meaningful models. We are still in the infancy of learning how to build more realistic 3-D tissue models, and there remain an endless number of questions and hypotheses to test about how infection actually happens in the body. Continued model advancement to better recapitulate the in vivo tissue microenvironment coupled with the application of multiple 3-D model systems will lead to increased translation of research discoveries to practical and significant outcomes. Such advances will be pivotal for the success of personalized medicine approaches using patient-specific normal and diseased cells and of incorporation of the full repertoire of immune cells to predict clinical correlates of protection for vaccine development. Toward this goal, we must deeply comprehend 3-D tissue/organ structure and function, the associated microenvironment, and the microorganisms to be studied. It is likewise important that we are aware of and acknowledge the rich history and work of researchers who have long applied 3-D tissue modeling to study host-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we should revisit past research in the field to help us understand and guide our direction. While it remains a daunting task to gain a complete understanding of infectious disease, the alignment of multidisciplinary research teams dedicated to the establishment of 3-D models that reconstruct the architecture and function of the in vivo organ and their application for host-pathogen interaction studies make this an exciting time to be a scientist!ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Michael Northrop for his illustration in Fig. 1.

    "methods": "Methods Mammalian cell lines, bacterial strains, and flight hardware The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in GTSF-2 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.25 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL insulin transferrin selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter. Media used to expand cells as monolayers contained Penicillin–Streptomycin (10 units/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) and fungizone (0.5 µg/mL). Flight culture media contained only streptomycin (Sm) and fungizone. Infection studies were performed with wild-type S. Typhimurium χ3339, a mouse-passaged derivative of SL1344 which is naturally Sm-resistant24. Bacteria were cultured in Lennox Broth (LB) containing 0.3 M NaCl prior to loading in the hardware, as described below. HT-29 cells were cultured in 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum Labs) that were housed in the Cell Culture Module (CCM; Tissue Genesis). The CCM hardware enabled automated media perfusion, addition of bacteria to perform infections and sample fixation. Flight comparisons were made to identical ground controls housed in the same hardware at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The flight hardware and experimental layout are shown in Fig. 1. Preparation of S. Typhimurium Ten days before launch, S. Typhimurium strain χ3339 was streaked from a glycerol stock onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL Sm and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial colonies were then used to inoculate overnight cultures grown for 15–16 h. with aeration in LB media containing 0.3 M NaCl and 100 µg/mL Sm at 37 °C. Cultures were pelleted at 7000 r.p.m. and resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen). Bacteria were quantified by plating for viable CFU per mL and diluted to 1 × 107 CFU/mL in DPBS to maintain the bacteria as viable but not actively growing. On L-7, flight bacteria bags were filled with 2 mL of the cultures and maintained at room temperature until attachment to the flow paths 2 days prior to launch (L-2). Preparation of hollow fiber bioreactors, media bags and fixatives Sterile bioreactors were wetted with 70% ethanol (10 mL) and then rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL DPBS. A 1 mg/mL collagen I solution (bovine, Corning) in DPBS was then introduced through the ECS ports to coat the hollow fibers. After 1 h, bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS through the ECS ports to remove unbound collagen. Bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL of warm flight medium and placed at 37 °C until ready for loading with HT-29 cells. Flight and ground control bags contained either 60 mL of flight culture media or 40 mL RNAlater II fixative (Ambion) for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Preparation and loading of HT-29 cells into flight hardware HT-29 cells were expanded as monolayers in T-75 flasks. Four days prior to launch, confluent monolayers were washed in warm Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution without calcium and magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific), dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Corning), and counted using trypan blue exclusion to determine cell viability. Approximately 1 × 106 HT-29 cells were loaded into twelve 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum) through the ECS ports (Fig. 1). Six bioreactors were designated for flight (three infected and three time-matched uninfected controls) and six for identical ground controls. Bioreactors were placed at 37 °C and rotated every 15 min until attachment to the CCM rails together with the flight media bags. CCM rails are organizational subunits within the CCM that facilitate gas and media delivery. Rails were placed into a 37 °C incubator and monitored for contamination. Media was circulated within the ICS of the fibers during the experiment at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. The day prior to launch, the fully loaded rails containing the HT-29 cells, media, fixatives and bacteria (maintained in stasis in DPBS) were integrated into the CCM, which was then sealed, powered and the temperature set to 37 °C. The CCM was turned over to the KSC integration team at L-18 h. STL-IMMUNE launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) on April 5, 2010 at 6:21 a.m. In-flight operations At approximately L + 3 h, astronauts activated the on-orbit programming of the CCM. On mission elapsed day 11, the CCM was programmed to automatically inject 1 mL (~1 × 107 bacteria) into a subset of the hollow fiber bioreactors to enable infection at the apical surface of host cells. Six hours after the bacteria were injected, RNAlater II was injected into the designated bioreactors and the rails were turned off to maintain sample temperature at 29–30 °C until landing. Postlanding processing STL-IMMUNE landed at KSC at 9:08 a.m. on April 20, 2010. All bioreactors and bags were removed from the rails and stored at 4 °C. Each reactor was carefully opened, cells and hollow fibers were maintained in RNAlater II at −80 °C until further processing. Inspection of the remaining volumes in the bacterial bags post flight indicated that all infected flight cultures received the intended 1 mL bacterial injection. Infected ground cultures received 0.8 and 0.4 mL injections for two replicates used for both the RNA-seq/iTRAQ analysis, and the third replicate received a 1.2 mL injection (this sample used for iTRAQ analysis only). For processing, RNAlater II-fixed samples were thawed at 4 °C. Samples were concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 (0.2 µm) concentrator. Cells were allowed to settle at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and then processed for iTRAQ and/or RNA-seq analysis. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis Proteomic analysis using iTRAQ was performed on total cellular protein from HT-29 cells from triplicate flight and ground bioreactors (n = 3 for flight and ground infected and uninfected cultures). Cells were lysed with 1 cell bed volume of RLT buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche), vortexed and passed 5–7 times through a 25G needle to facilitate lysis. After a 10-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were added to a desalting column (Pierce) and eluted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. From each condition 25 μg protein sample was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction (iTRAQ reagents—4plex Application kit, Applied Biosystems). Briefly, after protein reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion (Promega), and labeling with iTRAQ 4plex, peptide samples were quenched before pooled and vacuum-dried. The combined iTRAQ-reagent labeled sample was resuspended in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before separated with a 145-min gradient elution (using a Tempo LC MALDI Spotting system (Applied Biosystems)) and analyzed with a 4800 MALDI-tandem time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) as described82. Protein identification and quantification was performed with ProteinPilot 4.0 software using Paragon algorithm. The search parameters were as follows: iTRAQ 4plex (peptide labeled), trypsin as the digestion agent, UniProt database Homo sapiens (created on March 2009), ID focus: biological modification. Proteins were considered as differentially expressed according to the following criteria: greater than a twofold expression change, p value ≤ 0.05 (two-tailed ANOVA). Differential proteins were identified with at least three unique peptides (>95% confidence, 1% FDR). Identified and quantified proteins by LC MALDI-MS/MS are shown in Supplementary Dataset 1. RNA-Seq RNA was extracted from flight and ground cultures using remaining samples following the proteomics processing. From the remaining samples, RNA-seq analyses were performed using duplicate flight and ground bioreactors for all conditions (n = 2 biological replicates) except for the infected flight samples, which only had sufficient sample remaining to evaluate duplicate technical aliquots from a single bioreactor (i.e., n = 1 biological; n = 2 technical replicates). RNAlater II-fixed samples were lysed with 700 µl Qiazol (Qiagen), vortexed extensively and passed several times through a 25G needle. After a 5-min static incubation at room temperature with intermittent vortexing, samples were added to MaXtract High-Density tubes (Qiagen) together with 100 µl RNase-free water (Qiagen) and 200 µl chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then processed using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNase-treatment. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the integrity validated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 to confirm an RNA integrity number (RIN) of 7 or greater for all samples. All RIN were between 7 and 8 except for one of the uninfected ground control samples which had a RIN of 6.4. RNA was fragmented with heat and magnesium to roughly 300 bp using the KAPA HyperPrep RNA-seq kit (Roche). The KAPA Hyper RNA-seq kit and Illumina-compatible adapters (IDT) were used for the remaining library construction. Adapter ligated molecules were cleaned using Kapa pure beads (Kapa Biosciences) and amplified with Kapa HIFI enzyme. Each library was then analyzed for fragment size on an Agilent Tapestation and quantified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit) on Quantstudio 5 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Libraries were then multiplexed and sequenced on 2 × 150 flow cells on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina) at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core. RNA-seq reads for each sample were quality checked using FastQC v0.10.1 and aligned to Human GRCh38.p7 primary assembly and S. Typhimurium LT2 genome using STAR v2.5.1b. A series of quality control metrics were generated on the STAR outputs. Cufflinks v2.2.1 was used to report FPKM values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) and read counts. Transcripts per million was calculated by an in-house R script. Differential expression analysis was performed with EdgeR package from Bioconductor v3.2 in R 3.2.3. Multidimensional scaling plots were drawn by plotMDS, in which distances correspond to leading log-fold-changes between samples. For each pairwise comparison, genes with FDR <0.05 were considered significant and log2-fold changes of expression between conditions (logFC) were reported. GO biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis DAVID 6.8 was used to perform the enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data. Data were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, had threshold count of 2 and EASE score of 0.05.

Copyright notice ID: 7943786 PMID: 33750813 Abstract Spaceflight uniquely alters the physiology of both human cells and microbial pathogens, stimulating cellular and molecular changes directly relevant to infectious disease. However, the influence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells. Subject terms: Microbiology Humans will travel to space more frequently and for longer duration as the rapidly growing spaceflight industry enables more routine access for both professional astronauts and the public. Spaceflight can adversely affect multiple aspects of human physiology, including immune and gastrointestinal function1–4. While pre-flight screening and quarantine procedures have reduced infection incidence, astronauts and cargo can still harbor opportunistic and obligate pathogens, including Salmonella spp., which have been recovered from both crew refuse and International Space Station (ISS) surfaces5–8. We previously discovered that spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture increased the virulence and stress resistance of the foodborne pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella)9–12. These environments have also been shown to increase the virulence and/or alter pathogenesis-related phenotypes of other microorganisms13–16. Collectively, these findings indicate an increased risk for infection during space travel and underscore the need for a more in-depth understanding of the similarities and differences between spaceflight and ground-based infection mechanisms. Studies performed in spaceflight and spaceflight analog environments have revealed unexpected physiological responses in both mammalian and microbial cells14,15. This is not surprising given that physical forces in the cellular microenvironment (including those associated with microgravity) profoundly alter both host and pathogen phenotypes through mechanotransduction17. An integrated network involving the cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates the dynamic three-dimensional (3D) interactions between host cells and their external environment to regulate cellular responses17–19. Since spaceflight alters the organization and/or expression of these classes of proteins14,20,21, it is logical to predict that this environment could impact infection processes for invasive pathogens like Salmonella that hijack the host and actively exploit these structural networks to enable their invasion and dissemination22,23. From the pathogen perspective, we previously discovered that spaceflight analog culture of Salmonella in the Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor led to increased virulence in mice24, enhanced stress resistance9–11,24, global transcriptional and proteomic reprogramming11,12,24 and enhanced the colonization of a human 3D intestinal co-culture model (JB, SY, RRD, RJF, CMO, JS, CAN; manuscript in preparation). Space Shuttle experiments aboard STS-115 and STS-123 independently confirmed RWV trends by demonstrating that spaceflight increased the virulence and globally altered the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of Salmonella relative to identical ground controls9,10. Supplementation of select ions in the media was able to counteract this spaceflight-associated increased virulence10. It is important to note that Salmonella virulence studies were performed when the bacteria were cultured in spaceflight, brought back to Earth and immediately used in animal infections (i.e., the host was not exposed to spaceflight). Transcriptional profiling revealed a central role for the RNA-binding protein Hfq in the response of Salmonella to both spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture in the RWV9,10 and subsequent studies indicated altered expression of hfq or the Hfq regulon in other microbes25–28. In this study, we investigated how spaceflight culture alters the response of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) to infection by Salmonella when both the host and pathogen were exposed to spaceflight. The experiment was flown as part of the Space Tissue Loss (STL) payload and operationally designated as STL-IMMUNE, since epithelial cells are excellent sentinels of innate immunity by providing the first physical and chemical barriers to infection and coordinating additional innate and mucosal defenses and subsequent adaptive responses29,30. Since in-flight technical limitations precluded the use of gentamicin protection assays to quantify bacterial invasion into the epithelium, we focused our analysis on transcriptomic (dual RNA-seq of host and pathogen) and proteomic profiling (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification/iTRAQ). These global analyses can yield valuable insight into the status of healthy and infected cells. Figure 1 shows the experimental design and timeline for STL-IMMUNE and schematic of hollow fiber bioreactors used for 3D cell culture. HT-29 cells were seeded into the extracapillary space (ECS) of hollow fiber bioreactors which contained collagen I-coated capillary fibers for intestinal cell attachment. Oxygenated and CO2-containing media was continually perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS) of the fibers (underneath the basal side of the cells, which also prevented exposure of cells to high fluid shear forces). During spaceflight, Salmonella was introduced to the apical side of HT-29 cultures through ECS ports and allowed to incubate for 6 h before fixative was perfused through the ICS. Fig. 1. STL-IMMUNE experimental design and impact of spaceflight on uninfected HT-29 transcriptional profiles. Open in a new tab a Hollow fiber bioreactor technology. Photo and cross-sectional schematic of the hollow fiber bioreactors used in this study. Hollow fibers had a pore size of 0.3 µm to retain bacteria within the extracapillary space (ECS) while still facilitating nutrient and gas exchange via diffusion as oxygenated media was perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS). b STL-IMMUNE experimental design. HT-29 cells and bacteria were prepared as shown (see “Methods” section for additional detail). Bioreactors, bacteria, and fixative bags were integrated into the CCM hardware and launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery mission STS-131. Crew members activated the CCM once on orbit. At mission elapsed day 11, cultures were infected with S. Typhimurium for 6 h and fixed for postflight analysis.

The authors affirm that informed consent for publication of the images in Fig. 1 was provided.Between uninfected flight and ground HT-29 cultures, RNA-seq profiling showed significant differences in 307 genes (≥2-fold change; false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05; Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1). Evaluation of the top 5 significantly upregulated genes revealed the enhanced expression of several transcripts belonging to the small proline-rich (SPRR) family as well as DHRS9 (a retinol dehydrogenase) and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Fig. 1c). SPRR genes encode mechanosensitive proteins that play roles in barrier function, differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, wound healing and cancer31. They are also likely involved in the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to biomechanical stress32. Their expression is regulated by ECM/integrin interactions and by various stimuli, including UV radiation, inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and retinoids31,33. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of upregulated genes indicated enrichment in type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling/antiviral defense, DNA replication, and differentiation (including the SPRR genes) (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 2). The upregulation of viral defense genes was also previously observed in the livers of mice following spaceflight34. IFN-I signaling is complex and context dependent, regulating a broad range of cellular processes35,36. In addition to modulating innate and adaptive immune defenses against pathogens, IFN-I regulates intestinal homeostasis, including epithelial cell proliferation, and barrier function36,37. IFN-I signaling is often associated with decreased proliferation to promote differentiation, cellular repair, or defense against infection36,37. We found that genes important for glycolysis (SLC2A3, HK2, PFKFB3, PFKFB4, PDK1) and fatty acid metabolism (FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL5, EHHADH, SIRT4) were downregulated in flight (Supplementary Table 1). Previous spaceflight studies using either cultured macrophages38 or murine liver tissue34 also saw the suppression of multiple glycolytic enzymes, with the latter study postulating a model linking spaceflight changes in cellular metabolism, ROS, and immune dysregulation34. The downregulation of these bioenergetic pathways in our study could indicate the reduced proliferation of the flight cultures, which could result from a number of phenotypes, including decreased tumorigenicity/increased differentiation, increased DNA damage or apoptosis. During cancer metabolism, glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis is often elevated39. Several genes highly expressed in tumors or undifferentiated cells were also downregulated in flight, including CA9, CA12, CEACAM6, ITGA5, CLDN2, COL5A2, VIM, PROM1, and LGR4 (Supplemental Table 1). Together, these trends may indicate decreased tumorigenicity of the flight cells. Salmonella is known to preferentially colonize cancer cells40, thus differences in tumorigenicity between flight and ground cultures could impact infection. Of relevance, we previously showed that RWV culture of HT-29 cells induced a more normal, differentiated phenotype relative to controls41. Although in our present study we saw indicators of increased differentiation of the flight cultures, there were also some potential indicators of increased tumorigenicity (e.g., downregulation of VIL, TP53I11, upregulation of CCAT1; Supplemental Table 1). In addition, LGR4 is also important for Paneth cell differentiation42. A reduction in Paneth cells could diminish antimicrobial defenses. Host metabolism is also important in the context of an impending infection as the pathogen must scavenge for available nutrients43,44. Decreases in intracellular glucose could dampen intracellular pathogen replication depending on the availability of other nutrients. However, Salmonella has evolved an impressive metabolic plasticity to exploit diverse nutrients in parallel, even at trace levels44. Engagement of IFN-I signaling and decreased expression of metabolic genes could also indicate increased apoptosis. However, pro-apoptotic genes BNIP3 and BNIP3L were downregulated in flight, suggesting reduced apoptosis. A previous spaceflight study45 showed reduced apoptosis and increased differentiation in MIP-101 colon cells, as well as increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen proteins (often upregulated in colon cancer). In our study, we observed the downregulation of CEACAM6 (Supplementary Table 1). IFN-I signaling can also be activated by the DNA damage response following exposure to radiation, oxidative stress, or other harmful stimuli. DNA damage can occur during spaceflight due to radiation exposure and oxidative stress, including in the gastrointestinal tract46–49. Chromosomal damage has been observed in astronauts48,49 and we previously saw the downregulation of select DNA repair genes in astronaut blood cells50, which could potentially impede repair. In our present study, several genes involved in checkpoint-mediated responses to DNA damage and replication stress were upregulated (BRCA1, CLSPN, MCM10, RRM2, and KIAA0101). Thus, it is also possible that changes in IFN-I and metabolic genes could be due to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and/or radiation exposure. GO analysis of downregulated genes indicated enrichment in cellular components related to the cell surface/membrane and extracellular components as well as complement and coagulation pathways (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 2). Decreased expression of genes encoding factors classically associated with blood or other tissues was observed, including complement and fibrinogen complex proteins (e.g., C3, FGG, FGA, and FGB) (Supplementary Table 2). Fibrinogen and complement proteins are also expressed by epithelial cells and play an important role in infection51–54. However, as there are cases where RNA from fetal bovine serum (FBS) in culture media has been detected in mRNA analyses55, we cannot exclude the possibility of FBS interference. Importantly, the same batch of heat-inactivated FBS was used for identical and simultaneous preparation of all flight and ground cultures in this study. We also performed iTRAQ analysis to obtain a snapshot of the cellular proteomic profile in the uninfected flight cultures compared to ground controls. The presence of FBS in the culture media resulted in strong interference from bovine proteins; a subset of which could not be distinguished from human proteins due to their identical sequence homologies and thus were excluded from our analysis. Despite this challenge, we observed flight-associated upregulation of the major cytoskeletal proteins G-actin and tubulin, which are known targets of Salmonella effectors to facilitate invasion56 (Supplementary Table 3). HSPA1A protein was also 2.4-fold upregulated in flight. None of these proteins were differentially regulated at the transcriptional level; however, it is fairly common to see divergence in mRNA and protein expression due to a variety of biological factors, such as alterations in posttranscriptional modifications, translation efficiency and RNA or protein stabilities (reviewed by Maier et al.)57. We then examined the data for the infections performed with Salmonella during spaceflight and in our ground controls. The experiment was designed to automatically inject 1 mL bacterial inoculum (~1 × 107 colony forming units (CFU)) into HT-29 cultures. Postlanding hardware inspection revealed that all flight samples received the intended volume of bacteria; however, ground controls received slightly different volumes (see “Methods” section). The 6-h incubation in the absence of gentamicin would have allowed sufficient time for the bacteria to replicate in the media during attachment and invasion, but it is unknown whether differences in initial inoculum eventually equalized. In addition, while we had sufficient material to perform iTRAQ analysis using triplicate cultures, only one infected flight sample had enough material remaining after proteomics for RNA-seq, thus we analyzed multiple technical replicates from a single flight bioreactor for that condition (see “Methods” section). Acknowledging these limitations, given the rare nature of these samples due to the inherent difficulty in performing spaceflight infections, we present a preliminary analysis of the host and pathogen response during spaceflight infection. Rather than focusing on the direct quantitative comparison between the infected flight and ground cultures, we instead focused on evaluating the gene expression patterns elicited during either a spaceflight or ground-based infection relative to their respective controls (infected vs. uninfected for flight and ground) (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables 4–7). However, we also include the direct comparisons of the host response to infection between flight and ground for comparison in future studies (Supplementary Table 8), as well as the bacterial genes expressed above background during the flight and ground infections (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10) and directly between flight and ground infected cultures (Supplementary Table 11).

BP biological process, CC cellular component, MF molecular function. Bars in d indicate the results for a flight infection (yellow; flight infected/uninfected) and ground infection (gray; ground infected/uninfected).Analysis of flight and ground cultures indicates both common and distinct host transcriptional profiles in response to Salmonella infection (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables 4–7). Overall, 35 transcripts were altered in response to infection in both flight and ground conditions; 28 genes in the same direction and 7 oppositely regulated (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Tables 4–7). Relative to their respective uninfected controls, both flight- and ground-infected cultures displayed enrichment in biological functions and pathways expected for Salmonella-infected cultures, including the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation (TNF, IL-1, NF-κB, and NOD signaling), response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cell chemotaxis (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Tables 5 and 7). Interaction of Salmonella with the intestinal epithelium initiates a series of signaling cascades leading to intestinal inflammation58. In vivo, this defensive response serves to recruit neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection but can also lead to the generation of ROS that confers a strategic advantage for Salmonella to outcompete resident microbiota58. Both flight and ground infections induced upregulation of IRAK2, a protein that plays a central role in TLR signaling to NF-κB for the production of pro-inflammatory mediators59. NF-κB-related genes commonly induced during both flight and ground infections included the Rel protein NFKB2 and the atypical IκB member, NFKBIZ (Supplementary Tables 4 and 6). RELB and REL, which encode distinct Rel proteins which are induced in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns/PAMPs (e.g., flagellin, LPS), were also upregulated in flight and ground infections, respectively (Supplementary Tables 4 and 6). In line with these observations, both flight and ground infections led to the upregulation of transcripts encoding several chemokines important for recruiting neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, and CCL20. NFKBIZ encodes NF-κB inhibitor zeta (IκBζ), which both represses and activates select NF-κB genes60. IκBζ is rapidly induced in response to infection or exposure to potent TLR stimuli and is an important inhibitor of nuclear NF-κB activity to prevent uncontrolled inflammation61. These findings confirm that during spaceflight, Salmonella can induce a subset of the known biosignatures of infection in the host at the transcriptional level. In addition to those commonly observed responses, both flight and ground cultures also displayed unique transcriptional responses to infection (Fig. 2b, c; Supplementary Tables 4–7). DAVID analysis of upregulated genes in the infected flight cultures indicated that they were enriched for negative regulation of NF-κB transcription factor activity as well as those involved in Epstein–Barr virus infection (Fig. 2c). Genes belonging to these categories overlap with those known to be important for Salmonella infection. Two uniquely upregulated genes of interest belonging to these categories were anti-inflammatory mediator NFKBIA (IκBα) and NF-κB transcription factor, RELB. IκBα functions by sequestering NF-κB in the cytoplasm to prevent its translocation to the nucleus62. RelB is induced in response to severe systemic inflammation, LPS, flagellin and/or TNF stimulation and is required for sustained expression of IκBα during LPS tolerance62. Both proteins are known to be targeted by Salmonella to suppress host inflammation and/or apoptosis63,64. Changes in the expression of these transcripts may reflect an attempt by the host and/or pathogen to initiate processes to suppress excessive inflammation or apoptosis during the flight infection. Ground cultures uniquely displayed enrichment in select upregulated genes associated with cell chemotaxis and inflammation (the latter include genes classified by DAVID under the ‘Rheumatoid arthritis’ category but overlap in their role for Salmonella infection). Conversely, downregulated genes were enriched for diverse biological processes (e.g., cell adhesion, ECM organization, fibrinogen complex, glycolysis, hypoxia), cellular components (e.g., cell surface/membrane, exosome, and fibrinogen complex), molecular functions associated with binding and KEGG pathway involved in ECM-receptor interaction. Interestingly, although we observed the expected stimulation of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) in the ground-based infection (Supplementary Table 6), this did not occur in the flight cultures at the time point evaluated. In alignment with the TLR4 trends, LPS-inducible PIGR was also upregulated only during the ground infection (Supplementary Table 6). A previous study using astronaut monocytes observed a significant decrease in TLR4 expression immediately following return from a space shuttle mission relative to measurements taken 10 days before launch and 15 days post landing65. Similarly, TLR4 was also downregulated in blood cells in-flight and post-flight relative to pre-flight levels during the Twins study48. PIGR encodes polymeric immunoglobulin receptor which transports dimeric secretory IgA (sIgA) across the epithelium and into intestinal secretions as part of the first line of defense in mucosal immunity. Our findings could indicate the potential for an altered intestinal mucosal immune response to infection in spaceflight. Hindlimb unloading disrupted intestinal immune homeostasis in rats, leading to decreased sIgA levels in the ileum, although the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB was still observed66. In astronauts, PIGR and/or sIgA expression in saliva or blood has increased following spaceflight48,67,68. However, sIgA levels in extraintestinal sites are not always predictive of intestinal responses69,70. Thus, there is a need for further investigation into how spaceflight regulates these intestinal-specific responses. iTRAQ analysis further revealed unique differences at the protein level in HT-29 cells for flight and ground infections. Keratins 8 and 18 (KRT 8, KRT18), both targets of the Salmonella effector SipC during invasion56, were downregulated in the infected flight cultures relative to the uninfected flight cultures (Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, these proteins were upregulated in response to infection in ground cultures (Supplementary Table 3). Infected flight cultures also displayed the downregulation of two additional cytoskeletal proteins, ACTG1 and TUBA1C, as well as a retinal dehydrogenase, ALDH1A1. As mentioned above, spaceflight-induced alterations in the uninfected flight cultures in several of these structural proteins relative to the uninfected ground controls, which may indicate the presence of an altered or dysregulated cytoskeletal landscape at the starting point for the infection. Spaceflight is known to alter the organization and/or expression of structural proteins14,20,21. Infection in ground controls induced changes in the expression of proteins with various functions, including heat shock/protein folding, RNA-binding, calcium-sensing, and disulfide bond catalysis (Supplementary Table 3). Heat shock protein HSPA1A was upregulated during infection in ground cultures but not in response to infection in flight. This difference between the flight and ground infections could possibly be attributed to the fact that the protein was already 2.4-fold upregulated in flight even in the absence of infection (see uninfected flight vs. ground comparison in Supplementary Table 3). Thus, the flight-cultured cells may have had sufficient amounts of HSPA1A protein readily available for response to infection. HSPA1A is a major stress-inducible member of the HSP70 family and can be upregulated as part of a cytoprotective response to a variety of stressors, including infection71. Heat shock proteins have previously shown altered expression (RNA and protein) in a variety of mammalian, plant, and prokaryotic cells during spaceflight or spaceflight analog culture, though not in a unified direction72, which is not surprising given their diverse functions. For example, multiple HSP70 transcripts were upregulated during BRIC-16, an Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture payload aboard STS-131 (the same Shuttle mission as the present study)72. We also performed a direct comparison between infected flight and ground cultures under the previously described limitations (Supplementary Table 8). Direct comparison indicated that infection during spaceflight-induced upregulation of host genes associated with inflammation, response to Salmonella challenge and/or wound healing relative to infected ground controls, including CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL2, CSF2, IL36B, MAPK13, JUN, FOS, KLC2, NCF2, FLNA, RHOG, among others (Supplementary Table 8). IL-8 chemokine expression can be stimulated by both LPS and flagellin73. Elevated IL-8 levels were previously observed in a postflight challenge using purified LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and astronaut immune cells, the latter collected either in-flight or at landing (relative to pre-flight levels)4,65. Interestingly, both increased and decreased IL-8 responses have been observed following postflight LPS challenge in crew immune cells74. An overall blunted response to E. coli LPS was observed when endothelial cells were challenged during spaceflight, including only a modest increase in IL-8 expression by flight cultures relative to ground75. As is the case in terrestrial studies, IL-8 responses to LPS challenge in the context of spaceflight will depend on the type of LPS and host cells evaluated, as well as LPS exposure in the context of a live pathogen. In this study, TLR4 was significantly downregulated in the infected flight samples relative to infected ground cultures (Supplementary Table 8), which suggests that the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., CXCL8) in the infected flight cultures may rely more heavily on other interactions, such as flagellin-mediated interactions with TLR5. Alternatively, the kinetics of infection may have been altered between flight and ground cultures, where TLR4 expression in the infected flight cultures may have occurred outside of our analysis time point. Future studies following the in-flight kinetics of infection would provide insight in this regard. iTRAQ analysis indicated that infection during spaceflight induced downregulation of multiple cytoskeletal genes and retinal dehydrogenase 1 relative to infected ground cultures (Supplementary Table 3). Direct comparison of the bacterial transcripts between infected flight and ground cultures indicated 328 upregulated genes and 1 downregulated gene (Supplementary Table 11). Transcripts associated with metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism), protein translation, antibiotic synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, RNA degradation, and biosynthesis of siderophore group non-ribosomal peptides were upregulated in flight. We also observed the upregulation of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump (Supplementary Table 11). Though we did not see changes in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 or 2 (SPI-1 or SPI-2) virulence genes, transcripts encoding major global virulence and/or stress regulators rpoS, rpoE, and rpoH were upregulated in flight relative to ground controls. Another global regular, hfq, was found to be expressed above background levels in the flight cultures, but not the ground cultures (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). However, in the direct comparison between infected flight and ground cultures, while we did observe an upward trend in hfq expression during spaceflight, it was not significant by FDR (7.8-fold; FDR = 0.24, p value = 0.006). In our previous studies, hfq was downregulated in Salmonella in response to both spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture9,12. Deletion of the gene impacted RWV trends in acid stress resistance and macrophage survival9. Hfq post-transcriptionally regulates gene expression by pairing mRNAs with cognate small non-coding RNAs to either inhibit or facilitate translation76. Given the diverse functions of hfq and its ability to both positively and negatively regulate translation, its absolute expression level can change depending on environmental conditions77. The conditions in our current study (GTSF-2 media, 37C, 5% CO2) are very different from those in our STS-115 experiment which solely looked at pure cultures of Salmonella (Lennox Broth/LB, ambient temperature). In addition, our STS-115 study was performed in the absence of the host, as all infections with microgravity-grown bacteria were done immediately upon landing. In our present study, the bacteria were co-cultured with host cells that had either been exposed to spaceflight prior to infection or infected as ground controls. Thus, the host cells in our current study experienced different environmental conditions (microgravity vs. unit gravity), which could also potentially contribute to observed bacterial differences. In addition, the cellular mRNA and protein concentration of hfq is tightly controlled by autoregulation and mRNA expression is also under control of several promoters, including σ32 (encoded by rpoH, a global stress response regulator that was also upregulated in response to spaceflight, Supplementary Table 11)77. It is unlikely that the Hfq protein was completely suppressed in ground cultures given its important role in diverse cellular functions; however, since bacterial proteins were not detected in our proteomics analysis these levels are unknown. If indeed elevated amounts of Hfq protein were present in the ground cultures relative to flight, it is possible that mRNA expression was inhibited in the ground cultures via autoregulation. Future studies will seek to confirm these gene expression trends and identify the associated regulatory mechanisms. To our knowledge, this study was the first to examine how human cells respond to microbial infection when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. In addition, it is the first global transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of human intestinal epithelial cultures during spaceflight (either infected or uninfected). Although the sample size was small in this study due to technical limitations, the results from this investigation suggest that spaceflight altered the transcriptional and proteomic profiles of both uninfected and infected host cells. Spaceflight culture of the uninfected cells led to the upregulation of genes associated with IFN-I signaling and decreased expression of multiple bioenergetic pathways, suggesting the potential for decreased proliferation relative to ground cultures. Decreased proliferation could be due to the changes in tumorigenic potential, differentiation or DNA damage responses. Salmonella infection induced a core set of pro-inflammatory responses in both conditions, but spaceflight culture also induced unique transcriptional and proteomic responses not observed in the identical ground controls. Trends observed between infected flight and ground samples were consistent with a heightened response of host cells to infection with Salmonella during spaceflight, including amplified induction of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators and wound healing. These findings are important to consider in the context of previously observed changes in astronaut intestinal microbiota3,48,78, where some alterations were linked with decreased abundance of anti-inflammatory species and increases in select pro-inflammatory species3,78. In addition, the use of nutritional countermeasures to prevent or mitigate infection including the modulation of nutritional supplements2,10 or probiotic microbes for intestinal health during spaceflight (including for protection against pathogens)79–81 are active areas of research and have shown promise in ground-based studies. Our investigation adds to the growing number of studies aimed at mitigating infectious disease risks to humans during spaceflight missions and for the general public on Earth. Methods Mammalian cell lines, bacterial strains, and flight hardware The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in GTSF-2 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.25 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL insulin transferrin selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter. Media used to expand cells as monolayers contained Penicillin–Streptomycin (10 units/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) and fungizone (0.5 µg/mL). Flight culture media contained only streptomycin (Sm) and fungizone. Infection studies were performed with wild-type S. Typhimurium χ3339, a mouse-passaged derivative of SL1344 which is naturally Sm-resistant24. Bacteria were cultured in Lennox Broth (LB) containing 0.3 M NaCl prior to loading in the hardware, as described below. HT-29 cells were cultured in 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum Labs) that were housed in the Cell Culture Module (CCM; Tissue Genesis). The CCM hardware enabled automated media perfusion, addition of bacteria to perform infections and sample fixation. Flight comparisons were made to identical ground controls housed in the same hardware at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The flight hardware and experimental layout are shown in Fig. 1.Preparation of S. Typhimurium Ten days before launch, S. Typhimurium strain χ3339 was streaked from a glycerol stock onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL Sm and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial colonies were then used to inoculate overnight cultures grown for 15–16 h. with aeration in LB media containing 0.3 M NaCl and 100 µg/mL Sm at 37 °C. Cultures were pelleted at 7000 r.p.m. and resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen). Bacteria were quantified by plating for viable CFU per mL and diluted to 1 × 107 CFU/mL in DPBS to maintain the bacteria as viable but not actively growing. On L-7, flight bacteria bags were filled with 2 mL of the cultures and maintained at room temperature until attachment to the flow paths 2 days prior to launch (L-2).Preparation of hollow fiber bioreactors, media bags and fixatives Sterile bioreactors were wetted with 70% ethanol (10 mL) and then rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL DPBS. A 1 mg/mL collagen I solution (bovine, Corning) in DPBS was then introduced through the ECS ports to coat the hollow fibers. After 1 h, bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS through the ECS ports to remove unbound collagen. Bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL of warm flight medium and placed at 37 °C until ready for loading with HT-29 cells. Flight and ground control bags contained either 60 mL of flight culture media or 40 mL RNAlater II fixative (Ambion) for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.Preparation and loading of HT-29 cells into flight hardware HT-29 cells were expanded as monolayers in T-75 flasks. Four days prior to launch, confluent monolayers were washed in warm Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution without calcium and magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific), dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Corning), and counted using trypan blue exclusion to determine cell viability. Approximately 1 × 106 HT-29 cells were loaded into twelve 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum) through the ECS ports (Fig. 1). Six bioreactors were designated for flight (three infected and three time-matched uninfected controls) and six for identical ground controls. Bioreactors were placed at 37 °C and rotated every 15 min until attachment to the CCM rails together with the flight media bags. CCM rails are organizational subunits within the CCM that facilitate gas and media delivery. Rails were placed into a 37 °C incubator and monitored for contamination. Media was circulated within the ICS of the fibers during the experiment at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. The day prior to launch, the fully loaded rails containing the HT-29 cells, media, fixatives and bacteria (maintained in stasis in DPBS) were integrated into the CCM, which was then sealed, powered and the temperature set to 37 °C. The CCM was turned over to the KSC integration team at L-18 h. STL-IMMUNE launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) on April 5, 2010 at 6:21 a.m.In-flight operations At approximately L + 3 h, astronauts activated the on-orbit programming of the CCM. On mission elapsed day 11, the CCM was programmed to automatically inject 1 mL (~1 × 107 bacteria) into a subset of the hollow fiber bioreactors to enable infection at the apical surface of host cells. Six hours after the bacteria were injected, RNAlater II was injected into the designated bioreactors and the rails were turned off to maintain sample temperature at 29–30 °C until landing.Postlanding processing STL-IMMUNE landed at KSC at 9:08 a.m. on April 20, 2010. All bioreactors and bags were removed from the rails and stored at 4 °C. Each reactor was carefully opened, cells and hollow fibers were maintained in RNAlater II at −80 °C until further processing. Inspection of the remaining volumes in the bacterial bags post flight indicated that all infected flight cultures received the intended 1 mL bacterial injection. Infected ground cultures received 0.8 and 0.4 mL injections for two replicates used for both the RNA-seq/iTRAQ analysis, and the third replicate received a 1.2 mL injection (this sample used for iTRAQ analysis only). For processing, RNAlater II-fixed samples were thawed at 4 °C. Samples were concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 (0.2 µm) concentrator. Cells were allowed to settle at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and then processed for iTRAQ and/or RNA-seq analysis.Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis Proteomic analysis using iTRAQ was performed on total cellular protein from HT-29 cells from triplicate flight and ground bioreactors (n = 3 for flight and ground infected and uninfected cultures). Cells were lysed with 1 cell bed volume of RLT buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche), vortexed and passed 5–7 times through a 25G needle to facilitate lysis. After a 10-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were added to a desalting column (Pierce) and eluted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. From each condition 25 μg protein sample was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction (iTRAQ reagents—4plex Application kit, Applied Biosystems). Briefly, after protein reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion (Promega), and labeling with iTRAQ 4plex, peptide samples were quenched before pooled and vacuum-dried. The combined iTRAQ-reagent labeled sample was resuspended in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before separated with a 145-min gradient elution (using a Tempo LC MALDI Spotting system (Applied Biosystems)) and analyzed with a 4800 MALDI-tandem time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) as described82. Protein identification and quantification was performed with ProteinPilot 4.0 software using Paragon algorithm. The search parameters were as follows: iTRAQ 4plex (peptide labeled), trypsin as the digestion agent, UniProt database Homo sapiens (created on March 2009), ID focus: biological modification. Proteins were considered as differentially expressed according to the following criteria: greater than a twofold expression change, p value ≤ 0.05 (two-tailed ANOVA). Differential proteins were identified with at least three unique peptides (>95% confidence, 1% FDR). Identified and quantified proteins by LC MALDI-MS/MS are shown in Supplementary Dataset 1.RNA-Seq RNA was extracted from flight and ground cultures using remaining samples following the proteomics processing. From the remaining samples, RNA-seq analyses were performed using duplicate flight and ground bioreactors for all conditions (n = 2 biological replicates) except for the infected flight samples, which only had sufficient sample remaining to evaluate duplicate technical aliquots from a single bioreactor (i.e., n = 1 biological; n = 2 technical replicates). RNAlater II-fixed samples were lysed with 700 µl Qiazol (Qiagen), vortexed extensively and passed several times through a 25G needle. After a 5-min static incubation at room temperature with intermittent vortexing, samples were added to MaXtract High-Density tubes (Qiagen) together with 100 µl RNase-free water (Qiagen) and 200 µl chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then processed using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNase-treatment. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the integrity validated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 to confirm an RNA integrity number (RIN) of 7 or greater for all samples. All RIN were between 7 and 8 except for one of the uninfected ground control samples which had a RIN of 6.4. RNA was fragmented with heat and magnesium to roughly 300 bp using the KAPA HyperPrep RNA-seq kit (Roche). The KAPA Hyper RNA-seq kit and Illumina-compatible adapters (IDT) were used for the remaining library construction. Adapter ligated molecules were cleaned using Kapa pure beads (Kapa Biosciences) and amplified with Kapa HIFI enzyme. Each library was then analyzed for fragment size on an Agilent Tapestation and quantified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit) on Quantstudio 5 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Libraries were then multiplexed and sequenced on 2 × 150 flow cells on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina) at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core. RNA-seq reads for each sample were quality checked using FastQC v0.10.1 and aligned to Human GRCh38.p7 primary assembly and S. Typhimurium LT2 genome using STAR v2.5.1b. A series of quality control metrics were generated on the STAR outputs. Cufflinks v2.2.1 was used to report FPKM values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) and read counts. Transcripts per million was calculated by an in-house R script. Differential expression analysis was performed with EdgeR package from Bioconductor v3.2 in R 3.2.3. Multidimensional scaling plots were drawn by plotMDS, in which distances correspond to leading log-fold-changes between samples. For each pairwise comparison, genes with FDR <0.05 were considered significant and log2-fold changes of expression between conditions (logFC) were reported.GO biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis DAVID 6.8 was used to perform the enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data. Data were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, had threshold count of 2 and EASE score of 0.05.Reporting summary Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.Supplementary information Supplementary Tables 1 to 11 (2MB, pdf) Supplementary Dataset 1 (65.4KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary Checklist (71.3KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was funded by NASA grants NNX09AH40G (C.A.N., C.M.O., J.B.) and 80NSSC18K1478 (C.A.N., C.M.O., and J.B.; includes NASA PECASE funding to J.B.).

    "abstract": "Abstract Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals (1). C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3). Because of the severity of these infections, C. albicans pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections, C. albicans lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (4–6). One host setting associated with enrichment for C. albicans in the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption (7). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD (8). C. albicans is enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (9–11) and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD (9,10). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD (9), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host. The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain (12,13). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (14–17). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving (18). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving (19,20). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (21,22). These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption. As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption in rats (23). Serum PGE2 levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization by C. albicans (24). Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (25), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor (26). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in C. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2 in reducing ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice. In this study, we show that C. albicans GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption. C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2 compared to mock-colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonist treatment. These results show for the first time that changes to the fungal microbiome can alter ethanol preference and ethanol-induced behavior in mice.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4–5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans at different times depending on the experiment. Mice were inoculated by pipetting 20uL containing 5×107 cells of C. albicans strain CKY101(59) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or PBS only for mock-colonized mice, directly into the mouth of the mouse as previously described (25). Mock-colonized mice were given 20uL of PBS directly into their mouths. Mice were monitored throughout the experiment for colonization as previously described (25). No fungal colonies were observed in mock-colonized mice. Mouse weight was measured throughout the experiment. Rarely, if a mouse lost 20% of its starting body weight, the mouse was euthanized. On the last day of each experiment, mice were anesthetized using the isoflurane drop method and euthanized via decapitation. Blood for serum and various organs were harvested for analysis. All mouse experiments were approved by the Tufts IACUC and were performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. Chemicals and Reagents The EP1 antagonist SC-51089 (Cayman Chemical) and the EP2 antagonist TG6–10-1 (Cayman Chemical) were resuspended in 2:3:5 mixture of DMSO:sterile water:PEG400. Antagonists were resuspended and mixed at a concentration that would yield 2mg/kg of each antagonist in 50uL and 50 uL of the mixture was injected intraperitoneally. Fifteen percent ethanol was prepared for consumption by diluting 95% ethanol (Fisher) with tap water. This solution was filter sterilized and added to sipper tubes for the two-bottle choice experiment. 16,16-dimethyl Prostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical) was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen to evaporate the solvent. It was then resuspended in DMSO and injected into mice subcutaneously at a concentration of 25, 50, 100, or 300 ug/kg. Two-Bottle Choice Ethanol or Saccharin Consumption During acclimation to the facility and single housing, mice also began acclimating to the sipper tubes used in the two-bottle choice experiment. Briefly, sterile acidified water was poured into 50 mL conical tubes (USA Scientific) and a sterile stopper (#6 Rubber, Ancare) with a sipper spout (Ancare) was placed into the 50 mL conical tube and wrapped with parafilm. Two of these sipper bottles with water were placed into standard cages for acclimation. Following acclimation, mice were weighed and assigned to groups with equal weights. Mice were inoculated with C. albicans or mock-inoculated on day −1. On day 0, 15% (vol/vol) ethanol or 0.0125% (wt/vol) saccharin replaced one water bottle. Mouse weight and tube weight were then measured daily throughout the experiment. Sipper bottles were rotated daily to minimize side preference. After 2–4 days of ethanol consumption, mice were euthanized as previously described. For ethanol preference, results show 26 mice per group from 3 replicate experimental trials. For saccharin preference, 14–15 mice per group from 2 experimental trials are shown. PGE-m ELISA Trunk blood from mice was obtained after decapitation, collected in BD blood collection tubes (365967, Fisher). Tubes were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf table-top microcentrifuge at 10,000g for 10 minutes and serum was stored at −80°C. Serum was assayed with a Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit (514531, Cayman) after removal of proteins by acetone precipitation. PGE-m ELISA was performed using the standard protocol, with derivatization, detailed in the product manual. Serum was diluted 15–25 times for the assay and OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader. A four parameter logistic curve was determined and raw PGE-m values were determined using the 4PL calculator by AAT Bioquest (60). Brain Dissection, RT-qPCR, and Primers Mouse brains were dissected, flash frozen on aluminum foil chilled with dry ice and kept at −80°C. A brain matrix (ZIVIC Instruments, 5325) was allowed to chill on ice for 30 minutes. 2 mm sections of the brain from directly anterior of the cerebellum to the frontal pole were then cut using clean straight razor blades and the brain matrix. Sections were then observed to find landmarks indicating the location of the dorsal striatum as previously described (61). The dorsal striatum was dissected and RNA was extracted as previously described (25). cDNA was then synthesized using random hexamer primers and RT-qPCR was performed as previously described (25). Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1. Ethanol-Induced Conditioned Taste Aversion Following arrival, mice were acclimated to single-housing and sipper tubes by placing one sipper tube of water in their cages. Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice (62). The first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours daily (termed days 1–5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated with C. albicans or PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12. Data were analyzed as a percentage of saline consumption compared to the initial amount consumed on day 6. Open Field Activity Test On the open field test (OFT) habituation day, mice were injected an average of 15 minutes before their respective trials with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally with an insulin syringe. Following 15 minutes, mice were gently placed in the center of a 37cm × 37cm plastic open field box. Mice were allowed to roam freely for 10 minutes and removed from the apparatus. The apparatus was then sterilized using 70% ethanol. This protocol was repeated for every mouse. On OFT test day, mice were injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol or sterile saline intraperitoneally an average of 15 minutes before their trials. The volume of injection varied from approximately 90–110uL depending on the weight of the mouse. The ethanol concentration was adjusted so that a mouse of average weight for the group would be injected with 100uL ethanol solution. The 10-minute test run and cleaning of the apparatus were repeated as above for every mouse. Mouse behavior was recorded using a web camera. Scoring videos was performed using EthovisionXT software to automatically determine distance traveled. Total distance traveled was plotted relative to the mean of the sterile saline group distance traveled. Balance Beam A balance beam apparatus was constructed using a square 0.25-inch diameter, 3-foot-long metal rod held approximately 1.5ft above the surface. A plastic box to hold bedding was affixed to one end to provide incentive for the mouse to cross the entirety of the balance beam. A reading lamp shining on the start zone of the beam was used as an aversive stimulus. Start and end points for the balance beam trials spanning 65 cm of the beam were marked. On habituation day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally approximately 15 minutes before the start of their first of 3 trials. Mice were then placed in the start zone to begin trial 1. After completing the trial, mice were given 30 seconds of rest in their home cage before the start of trial 2. Trials 2 and 3 were performed by the same procedure. After a mouse completed 3 trials, the balance beam was cleaned using 70% ethanol and the next mouse was tested. In the event that a mouse would freeze, or very rarely fall, they would be gently prodded or placed back on the bar until they completed the trial. All mice within a cohort underwent this procedure. On test day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline or injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol as described in the open field activity test section. These injections were performed approximately 15 minutes before the start of the first trial. A web camera was used to record mouse behavior during these trials. The 3 trials were repeated as described above. All mice completed the entirety of the 3 trials. Videos were blinded for scoring. Start and stop times were determined when the mouse’s nose crossed designated marks on the bar. A slip was determined when a mouse’s foot slipped below the bar or a significant slip from a standing position on the bar to the pelvis touching the bar occurred. A fall was scored when the mouse slipped to the underside of the bar. Very rarely a mouse would fall from the bar into safety padding below the bar. Both of these events were scored equally as falls. Time or slips and falls were summed for all 3 trials for each mouse. Loss of Righting Reflex Mice were co-housed with another mouse within the same group for the LORR. Their nestlet was removed for the test. Mice were injected with 3.5g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally and the time of injection was recorded. Within roughly 1–2 minutes most mice lost righting reflex which was defined as an inability to right themselves when lying on their back in a V-shaped plastic trough. The time when a mouse lost righting reflex was designated the LORR onset. Six minutes after injection, mice were given one minute of exposure to isoflurane via the drop method and euthanized as above. Occasionally, a mouse would have to be removed from the data due to shearing of an artery during injection—significantly altering LORR time. Blood Ethanol Concentration Assay Following LORR, trunk blood was collected and serum was extracted as previously described in the PGE-m ELISA section. For the blood ethanol concentration determination, an EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (ECET-100, BioAssay Systems) was used. Standard protocols were followed for the determination using serum that was diluted 15X. OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader.",
    "results": "Results C. albicans colonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described (25). We previously showed that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did not evoke significant inflammation (25). Colonized and mock-colonized mice were subjected to a continuous access two-bottle choice experiment where mice were given access to two sipper tubes containing water or 15% ethanol simultaneously as described in Materials and Methods. Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) (Figures 1A, B). C. albicans-colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to water (H2O-only) (Figure 1C). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice throughout the experiment (Figure 1D). From these results, we concluded that C. albicans colonization reduced ethanol consumption in female mice. Figure 1: C. albicans-colonized mice consume significantly less ethanol and have lower ethanol preference than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS. After inoculation, mice were subjected to a 2-bottle choice experiment, with one bottle of 15% ethanol (vol/vol) and one bottle of water. Liquid consumption was measured by weighing the bottles daily. (A) Ethanol consumption (gm ethanol/kg body weight) on the first and second day of access to ethanol.

(F) CFU/gm fecal pellets from the saccharin preference experiment. Symbols as in panel D. (A-C,E) Boxes represent mean values, error bars show standard deviation, and each symbol represents an individual mouse. A two-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures was performed for statistics (* p=0.0144; ** p<0.0035; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001).Saccharin preference was tested to determine whether C. albicans colonized mice showed alterations in preference to other rewarding substances (27). Saccharin preference was measured in a similar continuous access two-bottle choice experiment as described in Materials and Methods. Saccharin preference per day showed no effect of C. albicans colonization (Figure 1E). CFU/gram of FP or CC showed colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 1F). These results showed that C. albicans colonization did not exert broad effects on consumption of all rewarding substances. Rather, the effects were more selective. C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and PGE2 injection reduces murine ethanol preference. Levels of PGE2 were measured in serum obtained from C. albicans-colonized or mock-colonized mice following two days of ethanol consumption. Since PGE2 is not a stable molecule, concentrations of a metabolite of PGE2, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 (PGE-m), commonly utilized as a marker for PGE2 (28), were assayed by ELISA. The assay showed that C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE-m levels compared to H2O-only or mock groups (Figure 2A). Figure 2. C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and injection of dmPGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and serum was collected. (A) PGE-metabolite concentration, standardized to the average in mock-colonized mice within each experiment.

One-way ANOVA was performed for statistical analysis (*, p<0.0354) (B) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously once per day with dmPGE2 (concentrations as shown) or vehicle and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 4, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Ethanol consumed per day (gm ethanol/kg body weight) is shown. (C) Daily ethanol preference (volume ethanol solution consumed/total volume liquid consumed) is shown. (C and D) Mean and standard deviation are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse. Two-way ANOVA test corrected for repeated measures was used for statistical significance. ns p<0.0939; * p<0.0499; ** p<0.0082; *** p<0.0011; ****, p<0.0001.To test the effect of elevated PGE2 on ethanol consumption, a 4 day, two-bottle choice experiment was performed in which mice were injected with 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dm-PGE2), a commonly-used, stable derivative of PGE2 (29). Mice received either vehicle or one of four different concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice (Figures 2B, C). Thus, dm-PGE2 injection in mice decreased ethanol consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous PGE2 results in decreased ethanol consumption. EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels. Based on these results, we hypothesized that PGE2 is a key driver of reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. To test this hypothesis, female mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans or mock-colonized with PBS and injected with 2 g/kg each of an EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, Cayman Chemical) and an EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, Cayman Chemical) subcutaneously each day of the 2 day two-bottle choice experiment. Mock-colonized mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or preference (Figure 3A,B). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2. Some reductions in total liquid consumed in C. albicans-colonized, vehicle-injected mice were observed (Figure 3C). Mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3D). Figure 3. EP receptor antagonism elevates C. albicans-colonized mouse ethanol consumption to mock-colonized levels in female and male mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice (A-D) or male C57BL/6 mice (E-H) were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS, injected subcutaneously with EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, 2 g/kg) and EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, 2 g/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. Females were euthanized on day 2, males on day 4.

Boxes represent mean values, error bars show standard deviation, and each symbol represents an individual mouse. Two-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures was performed for statistics. ns p=0.1182; * p<0.0368; ** p<0.0054; *** p=0.0001; **** p<0.0001. (D, H) shows CFU/gram of fecal pellet on each day of collection. FP, fecal pellets; CC, cecum contents. Black circles (C. albicans with vehicle) or black triangles (C. albicans with antagonists) show individual mice. Geometric means are shown by bars, and geometric standard deviation is shown by error bars. Two-way ANOVA performed for statistics.We also tested whether male mice had a reduction in ethanol consumption following C. albicans colonization and whether this phenotype could be reversed by EP antagonists. A trend towards reduction in ethanol consumption by the vehicle injected, C. albicans-colonized mice was observed on day 2 of ethanol consumption, and total liquid-consumed was also reduced (Figures 3E,F,G). These mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3H). These results support the model that activation of EP1/EP2 receptors in C. albicans-colonized mice decreases their ethanol consumption and preference. Further experiments were conducted with females only since females showed strong effects of colonization. Increased Serum PGE2 in C. albicans-colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in the Brain. We next tested the hypothesis that C. albicans gut colonization and elevation of PGE2 concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE2 binds to its cognate receptors encoded by four different genes, Ep1, Ep2, Ep3, and Ep4(30). PGE2 has been shown to upregulate expression of Ep receptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell lines and various tissues in the body(31,32). We decided to focus on a region of the brain involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS) (33), as well as other addiction-implicated regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)(34). To test the hypothesis, RT-qPCR from DS-cDNA was performed and expression of Ep1 and Ep2 relative mock-colonized from the same experimental trial was measured. There were no significant differences in Ep receptor expression between groups in the DS, PFC, or NAc (Figure S1). However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans-colonized mouse were observed. Gene expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A,B demonstrates that mice with higher concentrations of serum PGE2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2. In mock-colonized mice, there were no significant correlations (Figure 4C,D). We observed similar significant correlations of Ep1 expression and PGE-m concentration in the PFC and NAc (Figure S2). Elevated PGE2 levels were thus associated with higher expression of Ep receptors in multiple regions of the brain. Figure 4. Serum PGE-metabolite correlates with EP Receptor expression in the dorsal striatum in C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brain and serum were collected. Expression of Ep genes relative to average expression in mock-colonized mice from the same experimental trial, plotted as a function of concentration of PGE-metabolite standardized to the average in mock-colonized mice in the same experimental trial. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. (A,B) C. albicans-colonized mice (black circles) (C,D) mock-colonized mice (open circles). (A,C) Ep1 (B,D) Ep2. Pearson correlations were used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. Significant correlations were observed between Ep1 and Ep2 expression and concentration of PGE-M in C. albicans-colonized mice.We also analyzed the expression of dopamine receptors in the DS of these mice. The dopamine system in the DS is commonly involved with learning and habit formation (35). Expression of two main classes of dopamine receptors, Drd1 and Drd2, was measured (36). A trend towards a reduction in Drd1 expression and a statistically significant reduction in Drd2 expression in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized were observed (Figure 5A). Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in expression in the PFC or NAc (Figure S3). Furthermore, other addiction-related genes showed no significant differences in expression in the DS (Figure S4). These results show that both C. albicans colonization and low-dose dm-PGE2 injections reduce dopamine receptor expression in the DS. Figure 5. Both C. albicans colonization and low dose dmPGE2 injection result in lower Drd2 receptor expression in the Dorsal Striatum. Open in a new tab (A) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice by real time RT qPCR using the ddCT method. (B) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously each day with dmPGE2 (low dose = 25 or 50 ug/kg; high dose = 100 or 300 ug/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 4, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the DS by RT-qPCR using the ddCT method. Outliers were removed with ROUT to determine mathematical outliers (Q=0.1% to remove definitive outliers). (A,B) Geometric means and geometric SDs are shown and Two-way ANOVA was performed for statistical significance.Expression of Drd1 or Drd2 in mock or C. albicans-colonized mice correlated with total ethanol consumed. In the dorsal striatum, DRD1 is involved with reward formation and DRD2 is involved with aversion formation (37). Plots of Drd expression and total ethanol consumed showed a significant positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption in mock-colonized mice (Figure 6A) and a trend towards a positive correlation between Drd2 and total ethanol consumed (Figure 6C). In C. albicans-colonized mice, by contrast, a significant negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed (figure 6D). No correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumed was observed in these mice (Figure 6B). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice that consumed lower amounts of ethanol exhibited higher expression of the aversion-associated DRD2 receptor. Figure 6: Drd Expression correlates with ethanol consumption in mock and C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice. Total ethanol consumption (gm/kg) is plotted as a function of relative Drd expression. Pearson correlation used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. (A, C) mock-colonized mice. (B, D) C. albicans-colonized mice. (A, B) Drd1 fold change of relative expression. (C, D) Drd2 fold change of relative expression. Significant correlations between Drd1 expression and ethanol consumption by mock-colonized mice and Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption by C. albicans colonized mice were observed. Candida albicans colonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in mice. Based on the low ethanol consumption and negative correlation between Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice, we hypothesized that these mice would show enhanced ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Ethanol-induced CTA is based on the principle that mice will develop an aversion to a novel tasting solution when it is paired with an ethanol injection (38,39). Mice were tested for ethanol-induced CTA as described in Materials and Methods. The first exposure to the tastant showed the baseline consumption level, prior to injection (conditioning) with ethanol or control (sterile saline). Trials 2–4 showed consumption after conditioning, expressed as the change from initial consumption (Figure 7A). In trial 2, control mice showed similar or higher than baseline consumption of the tastant. Both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 3g/kg ethanol developed a near complete aversion to the tastant (100% reduction), which continued through trials 3 and 4. In contrast, mice given a lower concentration of ethanol (2g/kg) showed differences between groups. There was no significant aversion in the mock-colonized mice in trial 2 of this injection group and C. albicans-colonized mice showed a significant reduction in saline consumption compared to control mice in trial 2. On trial 3, both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 2g/kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment (Figure 7B, S5). C. albicans-colonized mice thus developed ethanol-induced CTA more rapidly. Figure 7: C. albicans-colonized mice develop conditioned taste aversion more rapidly than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were trained to drink their daily liquid in the late morning. Mice orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS were given one hour of access to a novel tastant, 1.2% saline solution, and then injected intraperitoneally with ethanol (2 g/kg or 3 g/kg) or control (sterile saline). Tastant consumption on the first trial (before injection with ethanol) was used as the baseline measurement and consumption on later trials was compared to trial 1. (A) percent change of tastant consumption relative to each individual mouse’s trial one consumption (pre-conditioned stimulus).

C. albicans-colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism. The more rapid development of ethanol-induced CTA in C. albicans-colonized mice suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol as correlations between these phenotypes have been observed (40). Therefore, we tested whether C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol (Figure 8A). Figure 8: C. albicans-colonized mice are more sensitive to effects of ethanol.

Mice were injected with ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental trial (mock or C. albicans-colonized) (Figure 8B). Results showed a significant reduction in distance traveled by C. albicans-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to C. albicans-colonized, SS-injected mice. There was not a significant reduction in distance traveled by the mock-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to SS-injected mice. These results show that the C. albicans-colonized mice were more strongly affected by ethanol. The loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiment tested the ability of mice to right themselves after injection with a sedative amount of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) (42). The time for the mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or C. albicans-colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset (Figure 8C). C. albicans-colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice (Figure 8D). These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment (including prior treatment) and C. albicans-colonization that increased the sedative effects of ethanol. Motor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam (43). Mice were injected with SS or ethanol and their performance was assessed. The total number of slips or falls throughout three trials (Figure 8E) and the total amount of time required to complete three trials were measured (figure 8F). Mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice injected with SS did not slip/fall often and completed the trials quickly. Mock-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed a significant increase in slips and falls, consistent with ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed significantly more slips and falls than any of the other groups and were significantly slower. Furthermore, there were no differences in colonization or mouse weight in these experiments (Figure S6). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice showed more ethanol-induced impairment in motor coordination. To test the hypothesis that PGE2 signaling contributed to the differences in mouse susceptibility to the effects of ethanol, mice were injected with the combination of EP1 and EP2 antagonists (2mg/kg each) before each behavioral test. Total slips and falls on the balance beam test following these injections was measured. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol and antagonists showed a significant decrease in slips and falls compared to the ethanol and vehicle group (Figure 8G). There was no difference between the C. albicans-colonized group with ethanol and antagonists compared to either of the mock + ethanol injected groups. We did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the OFT or LORR (Figure S7). These results showed that blocking PGE2 signaling in C. albicans-colonized mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol-induced impairment of motor control. Taken together, the results showed that C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol, and to ethanol-induced impairment in motor control. PGE2 effects on EP1 and EP2 receptors make a major contribution to the mechanism of ethanol-induced motor impairment.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We demonstrate that C. albicans-colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and consumption. Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE2 signaling plays a significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference. Further, injection of uncolonized mice with dm-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. There was a somewhat dose-dependent response as low concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25–50 ug/kg) reduced consumption moderately and higher doses of dm-PGE2 (100–300ug/kg) reduced ethanol preference and consumption more strongly. Antibiotic treated mice with C. albicans gut colonization have been previously shown to exhibit elevated serum PGE-m levels (24). Mice treated with antibiotics but not inoculated with fungi showed a modest increase in serum PGE-m levels and this level was sufficient to promote inflammatory cell responses. C. albicans-colonized mice in our study, which did not use antibiotics, also showed modestly increased serum concentrations of PGE-m and PGE-m concentration correlated with ethanol preference. These results indicate that modest increases in serum PGE2 are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE2 in circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher levels of PGE2 in multiple organs. In fact, we saw evidence of increased PGE2 by correlations with Ep expression in all regions of the brain examined. PGE2 has previously been shown to alter the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by inducing alterations in endothelial permeability or by stimulating the retraction of pericytes from the surface of the BBB (44–46). PGE2 has also been shown to induce vasodilation (44). Vasodilatory effects and BBB alterations could lead to higher amounts of PGE2 in the brain and reduce ethanol consumption. These results support the model that, as PGE2 in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, and more PGE2 can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum and Ep1/Ep2 receptor expression in C. albicans-colonized mice. Synergy between the effects of C. albicans colonization and the effects of ethanol were also observed. Mice that received both ethanol and C. albicans were the only group with significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT. C. albicans-colonized mice that received multiple injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset than C. albicans-colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in integrity and permeability (47,48). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically increase BBB permeability (49). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the effects of PGE2, resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin preference may not be reduced by C. albicans colonization because of the lack of an additional insult to the BBB. PGE2 has previously been shown to affect the dopamine system. Dopamine is critical for habit, reward, and aversion formation (50). PGE2 treatment altered reward learning to morphine in mice (51,52), and has been shown to alter DRD signaling and behavior following cocaine ingestion (53). We observed that C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. Expression of one of the receptors, Drd2, was significantly decreased in C. albicans colonized mice and low-dose dm-PGE2-injected mice. Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), and Fos were unchanged. Significant expression differences of the Mu opioid receptor between mock and C. albicans-colonized mice appeared to be due to differences in ethanol consumption. These results indicate an altered regulation of the dopamine system in the DS observed in mice with low level increases in systemic PGE2 concentrations. Furthermore, when Drd expression in the DS was plotted against total ethanol consumption, significant positive or negative correlations were observed. DRD1 and DRD2 receptors in the dorsal striatum have well defined, consistent roles. DRD1 signaling in the DS is mostly involved with reinforcement or reward learning and DRD2 is most commonly involved with aversion-formation (37). A positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed in mock-colonized mice, but not in C. albicans-colonized mice suggesting dysregulation of the relationship of DRD1/reinforcement in these mice. Additionally, a negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. Results from the CTA suggest an aversion-dominated phenotype because colonized mice showed a more rapid acquisition of conditioned taste aversion. These findings support the conclusion that aversion to ethanol develops more readily in C. albicans-colonized mice. When conducting other behavioral tests, we found that C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. The performance on the balance beam could be restored to mock-colonized performance by EP1/EP2 antagonists. These results suggest that PGE2 impact on EP1 and EP2 receptors could contribute to motor control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in the OFT and LORR tests could be driven by other systems impacted by C. albicans colonization such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS) (25). Both therapeutic manipulation and gene knockouts of the ECS modulated LORR and OFT phenotypes (54–56). Effects of C. albicans colonization on this pathway (25) could play a role in these phenotypes. All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol naïve mice. The effects of C. albicans colonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are currently unknown. There could be an altered effect of C. albicans-colonization on the host in the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption (57,58). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with C. albicans colonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol consumption and these effects of C. albicans colonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research. In summary, we have shown that GI colonization by C. albicans elevates serum PGE2 and these changes correlate with changes in Ep and Drd receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. C. albicans colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression and C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. In conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol.",

Abstract Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.Introduction Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals (1). C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3). Because of the severity of these infections, C. albicans pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections, C. albicans lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (4–6). One host setting associated with enrichment for C. albicans in the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption (7). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD (8). C. albicans is enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (9–11) and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD (9,10). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD (9), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host. The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain (12,13). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (14–17). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving (18). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving (19,20). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (21,22). These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption. As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption in rats (23). Serum PGE2 levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization by C. albicans (24). Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (25), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor (26). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in C. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2 in reducing ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice. In this study, we show that C. albicans GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption. C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2 compared to mock-colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonist treatment. These results show for the first time that changes to the fungal microbiome can alter ethanol preference and ethanol-induced behavior in mice.Results C. albicans colonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described (25). We previously showed that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did not evoke significant inflammation (25). Colonized and mock-colonized mice were subjected to a continuous access two-bottle choice experiment where mice were given access to two sipper tubes containing water or 15% ethanol simultaneously as described in Materials and Methods. Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) (Figures 1A, B). C. albicans-colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to water (H2O-only) (Figure 1C). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice throughout the experiment (Figure 1D). From these results, we concluded that C. albicans colonization reduced ethanol consumption in female mice. Figure 1: C. albicans-colonized mice consume significantly less ethanol and have lower ethanol preference than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS. After inoculation, mice were subjected to a 2-bottle choice experiment, with one bottle of 15% ethanol (vol/vol) and one bottle of water. Liquid consumption was measured by weighing the bottles daily. (A) Ethanol consumption (gm ethanol/kg body weight) on the first and second day of access to ethanol.

A two-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures was performed for statistics (* p=0.0144; ** p<0.0035; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001).Saccharin preference was tested to determine whether C. albicans colonized mice showed alterations in preference to other rewarding substances (27). Saccharin preference was measured in a similar continuous access two-bottle choice experiment as described in Materials and Methods. Saccharin preference per day showed no effect of C. albicans colonization (Figure 1E). CFU/gram of FP or CC showed colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 1F). These results showed that C. albicans colonization did not exert broad effects on consumption of all rewarding substances. Rather, the effects were more selective. C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and PGE2 injection reduces murine ethanol preference. Levels of PGE2 were measured in serum obtained from C. albicans-colonized or mock-colonized mice following two days of ethanol consumption. Since PGE2 is not a stable molecule, concentrations of a metabolite of PGE2, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 (PGE-m), commonly utilized as a marker for PGE2 (28), were assayed by ELISA. The assay showed that C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE-m levels compared to H2O-only or mock groups (Figure 2A). Figure 2. C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and injection of dmPGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and serum was collected. (A) PGE-metabolite concentration, standardized to the average in mock-colonized mice within each experiment.

(C) Daily ethanol preference (volume ethanol solution consumed/total volume liquid consumed) is shown. (C and D) Mean and standard deviation are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse.

Mice received either vehicle or one of four different concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice (Figures 2B, C). Thus, dm-PGE2 injection in mice decreased ethanol consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous PGE2 results in decreased ethanol consumption.EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels. Based on these results, we hypothesized that PGE2 is a key driver of reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. To test this hypothesis, female mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans or mock-colonized with PBS and injected with 2 g/kg each of an EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, Cayman Chemical) and an EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, Cayman Chemical) subcutaneously each day of the 2 day two-bottle choice experiment. Mock-colonized mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or preference (Figure 3A,B). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2. Some reductions in total liquid consumed in C. albicans-colonized, vehicle-injected mice were observed (Figure 3C). Mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3D). Figure 3. EP receptor antagonism elevates C. albicans-colonized mouse ethanol consumption to mock-colonized levels in female and male mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice (A-D) or male C57BL/6 mice (E-H) were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS, injected subcutaneously with EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, 2 g/kg) and EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, 2 g/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1.

Black circles (C. albicans with vehicle) or black triangles (C. albicans with antagonists) show individual mice. Geometric means are shown by bars, and geometric standard deviation is shown by error bars. Two-way ANOVA performed for statistics.We also tested whether male mice had a reduction in ethanol consumption following C. albicans colonization and whether this phenotype could be reversed by EP antagonists. A trend towards reduction in ethanol consumption by the vehicle injected, C. albicans-colonized mice was observed on day 2 of ethanol consumption, and total liquid-consumed was also reduced (Figures 3E,F,G). These mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3H). These results support the model that activation of EP1/EP2 receptors in C. albicans-colonized mice decreases their ethanol consumption and preference. Further experiments were conducted with females only since females showed strong effects of colonization.Increased Serum PGE2 in C. albicans-colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in the Brain. We next tested the hypothesis that C. albicans gut colonization and elevation of PGE2 concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE2 binds to its cognate receptors encoded by four different genes, Ep1, Ep2, Ep3, and Ep4(30). PGE2 has been shown to upregulate expression of Ep receptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell lines and various tissues in the body(31,32). We decided to focus on a region of the brain involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS) (33), as well as other addiction-implicated regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)(34). To test the hypothesis, RT-qPCR from DS-cDNA was performed and expression of Ep1 and Ep2 relative mock-colonized from the same experimental trial was measured. There were no significant differences in Ep receptor expression between groups in the DS, PFC, or NAc (Figure S1). However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans-colonized mouse were observed. Gene expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A,B demonstrates that mice with higher concentrations of serum PGE2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2. In mock-colonized mice, there were no significant correlations (Figure 4C,D). We observed similar significant correlations of Ep1 expression and PGE-m concentration in the PFC and NAc (Figure S2). Elevated PGE2 levels were thus associated with higher expression of Ep receptors in multiple regions of the brain. Figure 4. Serum PGE-metabolite correlates with EP Receptor expression in the dorsal striatum in C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brain and serum were collected.

Pearson correlations were used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. Significant correlations were observed between Ep1 and Ep2 expression and concentration of PGE-M in C. albicans-colonized mice.We also analyzed the expression of dopamine receptors in the DS of these mice. The dopamine system in the DS is commonly involved with learning and habit formation (35). Expression of two main classes of dopamine receptors, Drd1 and Drd2, was measured (36). A trend towards a reduction in Drd1 expression and a statistically significant reduction in Drd2 expression in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized were observed (Figure 5A). Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in expression in the PFC or NAc (Figure S3). Furthermore, other addiction-related genes showed no significant differences in expression in the DS (Figure S4). These results show that both C. albicans colonization and low-dose dm-PGE2 injections reduce dopamine receptor expression in the DS. Figure 5. Both C. albicans colonization and low dose dmPGE2 injection result in lower Drd2 receptor expression in the Dorsal Striatum. Open in a new tab (A) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice by real time RT qPCR using the ddCT method. (B) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously each day with dmPGE2 (low dose = 25 or 50 ug/kg; high dose = 100 or 300 ug/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 4, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the DS by RT-qPCR using the ddCT method. Outliers were removed with ROUT to determine mathematical outliers (Q=0.1% to remove definitive outliers). (A,B) Geometric means and geometric SDs are shown and Two-way ANOVA was performed for statistical significance.Expression of Drd1 or Drd2 in mock or C. albicans-colonized mice correlated with total ethanol consumed. In the dorsal striatum, DRD1 is involved with reward formation and DRD2 is involved with aversion formation (37). Plots of Drd expression and total ethanol consumed showed a significant positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption in mock-colonized mice (Figure 6A) and a trend towards a positive correlation between Drd2 and total ethanol consumed (Figure 6C). In C. albicans-colonized mice, by contrast, a significant negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed (figure 6D). No correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumed was observed in these mice (Figure 6B). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice that consumed lower amounts of ethanol exhibited higher expression of the aversion-associated DRD2 receptor. Figure 6: Drd Expression correlates with ethanol consumption in mock and C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1. On day 2, mice were euthanized and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice. Total ethanol consumption (gm/kg) is plotted as a function of relative Drd expression. Pearson correlation used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. (A, C) mock-colonized mice. (B, D) C. albicans-colonized mice. (A, B) Drd1 fold change of relative expression. (C, D) Drd2 fold change of relative expression. Significant correlations between Drd1 expression and ethanol consumption by mock-colonized mice and Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption by C. albicans colonized mice were observed. Candida albicans colonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in mice. Based on the low ethanol consumption and negative correlation between Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice, we hypothesized that these mice would show enhanced ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Ethanol-induced CTA is based on the principle that mice will develop an aversion to a novel tasting solution when it is paired with an ethanol injection (38,39). Mice were tested for ethanol-induced CTA as described in Materials and Methods. The first exposure to the tastant showed the baseline consumption level, prior to injection (conditioning) with ethanol or control (sterile saline). Trials 2–4 showed consumption after conditioning, expressed as the change from initial consumption (Figure 7A). In trial 2, control mice showed similar or higher than baseline consumption of the tastant. Both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 3g/kg ethanol developed a near complete aversion to the tastant (100% reduction), which continued through trials 3 and 4. In contrast, mice given a lower concentration of ethanol (2g/kg) showed differences between groups. There was no significant aversion in the mock-colonized mice in trial 2 of this injection group and C. albicans-colonized mice showed a significant reduction in saline consumption compared to control mice in trial 2. On trial 3, both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 2g/kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment (Figure 7B, S5). C. albicans-colonized mice thus developed ethanol-induced CTA more rapidly. Figure 7: C. albicans-colonized mice develop conditioned taste aversion more rapidly than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were trained to drink their daily liquid in the late morning. Mice orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS were given one hour of access to a novel tastant, 1.2% saline solution, and then injected intraperitoneally with ethanol (2 g/kg or 3 g/kg) or control (sterile saline). Tastant consumption on the first trial (before injection with ethanol) was used as the baseline measurement and consumption on later trials was compared to trial 1. (A) percent change of tastant consumption relative to each individual mouse’s trial one consumption (pre-conditioned stimulus).

C. albicans-colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism. The more rapid development of ethanol-induced CTA in C. albicans-colonized mice suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol as correlations between these phenotypes have been observed (40). Therefore, we tested whether C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol (Figure 8A). Figure 8: C. albicans-colonized mice are more sensitive to effects of ethanol. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS on days 0 and 2, and subjected to the behavioral tests illustrated in panel (A). (B,C) Groups are defined as Mock +1x EtOH: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open circles); Mock + 3x EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open triangles); Ca + 1x EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black circles); Ca + 3x EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black triangles).

All injections were IP, given before habituation or testing. Ethanol injections were 1.5g/kg of mouse weight and antagonists were 2g/kg of both EP1 and EP2 antagonists.

Symbols represent individual mice. * p<0.0220; ** p<0.0055; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001.The first experiment was the open field activity test (OFT), which measures how susceptible C57BL/6 mice are to the depressant effects of alcohol based on the decrease in distance traveled in the OFT following ethanol injection (1.5 g/kg) (41). Mice were injected with ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental trial (mock or C. albicans-colonized) (Figure 8B). Results showed a significant reduction in distance traveled by C. albicans-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to C. albicans-colonized, SS-injected mice. There was not a significant reduction in distance traveled by the mock-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to SS-injected mice. These results show that the C. albicans-colonized mice were more strongly affected by ethanol. The loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiment tested the ability of mice to right themselves after injection with a sedative amount of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) (42). The time for the mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or C. albicans-colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset (Figure 8C). C. albicans-colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice (Figure 8D). These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment (including prior treatment) and C. albicans-colonization that increased the sedative effects of ethanol. Motor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam (43). Mice were injected with SS or ethanol and their performance was assessed. The total number of slips or falls throughout three trials (Figure 8E) and the total amount of time required to complete three trials were measured (figure 8F). Mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice injected with SS did not slip/fall often and completed the trials quickly. Mock-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed a significant increase in slips and falls, consistent with ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed significantly more slips and falls than any of the other groups and were significantly slower. Furthermore, there were no differences in colonization or mouse weight in these experiments (Figure S6). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice showed more ethanol-induced impairment in motor coordination. To test the hypothesis that PGE2 signaling contributed to the differences in mouse susceptibility to the effects of ethanol, mice were injected with the combination of EP1 and EP2 antagonists (2mg/kg each) before each behavioral test. Total slips and falls on the balance beam test following these injections was measured. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol and antagonists showed a significant decrease in slips and falls compared to the ethanol and vehicle group (Figure 8G). There was no difference between the C. albicans-colonized group with ethanol and antagonists compared to either of the mock + ethanol injected groups. We did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the OFT or LORR (Figure S7). These results showed that blocking PGE2 signaling in C. albicans-colonized mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol-induced impairment of motor control. Taken together, the results showed that C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol, and to ethanol-induced impairment in motor control. PGE2 effects on EP1 and EP2 receptors make a major contribution to the mechanism of ethanol-induced motor impairment.Discussion We demonstrate that C. albicans-colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and consumption. Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE2 signaling plays a significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference. Further, injection of uncolonized mice with dm-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. There was a somewhat dose-dependent response as low concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25–50 ug/kg) reduced consumption moderately and higher doses of dm-PGE2 (100–300ug/kg) reduced ethanol preference and consumption more strongly. Antibiotic treated mice with C. albicans gut colonization have been previously shown to exhibit elevated serum PGE-m levels (24). Mice treated with antibiotics but not inoculated with fungi showed a modest increase in serum PGE-m levels and this level was sufficient to promote inflammatory cell responses. C. albicans-colonized mice in our study, which did not use antibiotics, also showed modestly increased serum concentrations of PGE-m and PGE-m concentration correlated with ethanol preference. These results indicate that modest increases in serum PGE2 are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE2 in circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher levels of PGE2 in multiple organs. In fact, we saw evidence of increased PGE2 by correlations with Ep expression in all regions of the brain examined. PGE2 has previously been shown to alter the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by inducing alterations in endothelial permeability or by stimulating the retraction of pericytes from the surface of the BBB (44–46). PGE2 has also been shown to induce vasodilation (44). Vasodilatory effects and BBB alterations could lead to higher amounts of PGE2 in the brain and reduce ethanol consumption. These results support the model that, as PGE2 in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, and more PGE2 can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum and Ep1/Ep2 receptor expression in C. albicans-colonized mice. Synergy between the effects of C. albicans colonization and the effects of ethanol were also observed. Mice that received both ethanol and C. albicans were the only group with significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT. C. albicans-colonized mice that received multiple injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset than C. albicans-colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in integrity and permeability (47,48). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically increase BBB permeability (49). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the effects of PGE2, resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin preference may not be reduced by C. albicans colonization because of the lack of an additional insult to the BBB. PGE2 has previously been shown to affect the dopamine system. Dopamine is critical for habit, reward, and aversion formation (50). PGE2 treatment altered reward learning to morphine in mice (51,52), and has been shown to alter DRD signaling and behavior following cocaine ingestion (53). We observed that C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. Expression of one of the receptors, Drd2, was significantly decreased in C. albicans colonized mice and low-dose dm-PGE2-injected mice. Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), and Fos were unchanged. Significant expression differences of the Mu opioid receptor between mock and C. albicans-colonized mice appeared to be due to differences in ethanol consumption. These results indicate an altered regulation of the dopamine system in the DS observed in mice with low level increases in systemic PGE2 concentrations. Furthermore, when Drd expression in the DS was plotted against total ethanol consumption, significant positive or negative correlations were observed. DRD1 and DRD2 receptors in the dorsal striatum have well defined, consistent roles. DRD1 signaling in the DS is mostly involved with reinforcement or reward learning and DRD2 is most commonly involved with aversion-formation (37). A positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed in mock-colonized mice, but not in C. albicans-colonized mice suggesting dysregulation of the relationship of DRD1/reinforcement in these mice. Additionally, a negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. Results from the CTA suggest an aversion-dominated phenotype because colonized mice showed a more rapid acquisition of conditioned taste aversion. These findings support the conclusion that aversion to ethanol develops more readily in C. albicans-colonized mice. When conducting other behavioral tests, we found that C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. The performance on the balance beam could be restored to mock-colonized performance by EP1/EP2 antagonists. These results suggest that PGE2 impact on EP1 and EP2 receptors could contribute to motor control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in the OFT and LORR tests could be driven by other systems impacted by C. albicans colonization such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS) (25). Both therapeutic manipulation and gene knockouts of the ECS modulated LORR and OFT phenotypes (54–56). Effects of C. albicans colonization on this pathway (25) could play a role in these phenotypes. All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol naïve mice. The effects of C. albicans colonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are currently unknown. There could be an altered effect of C. albicans-colonization on the host in the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption (57,58). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with C. albicans colonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol consumption and these effects of C. albicans colonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research. In summary, we have shown that GI colonization by C. albicans elevates serum PGE2 and these changes correlate with changes in Ep and Drd receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. C. albicans colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression and C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. In conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol.Materials and Methods Animals Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4–5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans at different times depending on the experiment. Mice were inoculated by pipetting 20uL containing 5×107 cells of C. albicans strain CKY101(59) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or PBS only for mock-colonized mice, directly into the mouth of the mouse as previously described (25). Mock-colonized mice were given 20uL of PBS directly into their mouths. Mice were monitored throughout the experiment for colonization as previously described (25). No fungal colonies were observed in mock-colonized mice. Mouse weight was measured throughout the experiment. Rarely, if a mouse lost 20% of its starting body weight, the mouse was euthanized. On the last day of each experiment, mice were anesthetized using the isoflurane drop method and euthanized via decapitation. Blood for serum and various organs were harvested for analysis. All mouse experiments were approved by the Tufts IACUC and were performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.Chemicals and Reagents The EP1 antagonist SC-51089 (Cayman Chemical) and the EP2 antagonist TG6–10-1 (Cayman Chemical) were resuspended in 2:3:5 mixture of DMSO:sterile water:PEG400. Antagonists were resuspended and mixed at a concentration that would yield 2mg/kg of each antagonist in 50uL and 50 uL of the mixture was injected intraperitoneally. Fifteen percent ethanol was prepared for consumption by diluting 95% ethanol (Fisher) with tap water. This solution was filter sterilized and added to sipper tubes for the two-bottle choice experiment. 16,16-dimethyl Prostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical) was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen to evaporate the solvent. It was then resuspended in DMSO and injected into mice subcutaneously at a concentration of 25, 50, 100, or 300 ug/kg.Two-Bottle Choice Ethanol or Saccharin Consumption During acclimation to the facility and single housing, mice also began acclimating to the sipper tubes used in the two-bottle choice experiment. Briefly, sterile acidified water was poured into 50 mL conical tubes (USA Scientific) and a sterile stopper (#6 Rubber, Ancare) with a sipper spout (Ancare) was placed into the 50 mL conical tube and wrapped with parafilm. Two of these sipper bottles with water were placed into standard cages for acclimation. Following acclimation, mice were weighed and assigned to groups with equal weights. Mice were inoculated with C. albicans or mock-inoculated on day −1. On day 0, 15% (vol/vol) ethanol or 0.0125% (wt/vol) saccharin replaced one water bottle. Mouse weight and tube weight were then measured daily throughout the experiment. Sipper bottles were rotated daily to minimize side preference. After 2–4 days of ethanol consumption, mice were euthanized as previously described. For ethanol preference, results show 26 mice per group from 3 replicate experimental trials. For saccharin preference, 14–15 mice per group from 2 experimental trials are shown.PGE-m ELISA Trunk blood from mice was obtained after decapitation, collected in BD blood collection tubes (365967, Fisher). Tubes were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf table-top microcentrifuge at 10,000g for 10 minutes and serum was stored at −80°C. Serum was assayed with a Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit (514531, Cayman) after removal of proteins by acetone precipitation. PGE-m ELISA was performed using the standard protocol, with derivatization, detailed in the product manual. Serum was diluted 15–25 times for the assay and OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader. A four parameter logistic curve was determined and raw PGE-m values were determined using the 4PL calculator by AAT Bioquest (60).Brain Dissection, RT-qPCR, and Primers Mouse brains were dissected, flash frozen on aluminum foil chilled with dry ice and kept at −80°C. A brain matrix (ZIVIC Instruments, 5325) was allowed to chill on ice for 30 minutes. 2 mm sections of the brain from directly anterior of the cerebellum to the frontal pole were then cut using clean straight razor blades and the brain matrix. Sections were then observed to find landmarks indicating the location of the dorsal striatum as previously described (61). The dorsal striatum was dissected and RNA was extracted as previously described (25). cDNA was then synthesized using random hexamer primers and RT-qPCR was performed as previously described (25). Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.Ethanol-Induced Conditioned Taste Aversion Following arrival, mice were acclimated to single-housing and sipper tubes by placing one sipper tube of water in their cages. Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice (62). The first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours daily (termed days 1–5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated with C. albicans or PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12. Data were analyzed as a percentage of saline consumption compared to the initial amount consumed on day 6.Open Field Activity Test On the open field test (OFT) habituation day, mice were injected an average of 15 minutes before their respective trials with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally with an insulin syringe. Following 15 minutes, mice were gently placed in the center of a 37cm × 37cm plastic open field box. Mice were allowed to roam freely for 10 minutes and removed from the apparatus. The apparatus was then sterilized using 70% ethanol. This protocol was repeated for every mouse. On OFT test day, mice were injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol or sterile saline intraperitoneally an average of 15 minutes before their trials. The volume of injection varied from approximately 90–110uL depending on the weight of the mouse. The ethanol concentration was adjusted so that a mouse of average weight for the group would be injected with 100uL ethanol solution. The 10-minute test run and cleaning of the apparatus were repeated as above for every mouse. Mouse behavior was recorded using a web camera. Scoring videos was performed using EthovisionXT software to automatically determine distance traveled. Total distance traveled was plotted relative to the mean of the sterile saline group distance traveled.Balance Beam A balance beam apparatus was constructed using a square 0.25-inch diameter, 3-foot-long metal rod held approximately 1.5ft above the surface. A plastic box to hold bedding was affixed to one end to provide incentive for the mouse to cross the entirety of the balance beam. A reading lamp shining on the start zone of the beam was used as an aversive stimulus. Start and end points for the balance beam trials spanning 65 cm of the beam were marked. On habituation day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally approximately 15 minutes before the start of their first of 3 trials. Mice were then placed in the start zone to begin trial 1. After completing the trial, mice were given 30 seconds of rest in their home cage before the start of trial 2. Trials 2 and 3 were performed by the same procedure. After a mouse completed 3 trials, the balance beam was cleaned using 70% ethanol and the next mouse was tested. In the event that a mouse would freeze, or very rarely fall, they would be gently prodded or placed back on the bar until they completed the trial. All mice within a cohort underwent this procedure. On test day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline or injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol as described in the open field activity test section. These injections were performed approximately 15 minutes before the start of the first trial. A web camera was used to record mouse behavior during these trials. The 3 trials were repeated as described above. All mice completed the entirety of the 3 trials. Videos were blinded for scoring. Start and stop times were determined when the mouse’s nose crossed designated marks on the bar. A slip was determined when a mouse’s foot slipped below the bar or a significant slip from a standing position on the bar to the pelvis touching the bar occurred. A fall was scored when the mouse slipped to the underside of the bar. Very rarely a mouse would fall from the bar into safety padding below the bar. Both of these events were scored equally as falls. Time or slips and falls were summed for all 3 trials for each mouse.Loss of Righting Reflex Mice were co-housed with another mouse within the same group for the LORR. Their nestlet was removed for the test. Mice were injected with 3.5g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally and the time of injection was recorded. Within roughly 1–2 minutes most mice lost righting reflex which was defined as an inability to right themselves when lying on their back in a V-shaped plastic trough. The time when a mouse lost righting reflex was designated the LORR onset. Six minutes after injection, mice were given one minute of exposure to isoflurane via the drop method and euthanized as above. Occasionally, a mouse would have to be removed from the data due to shearing of an artery during injection—significantly altering LORR time.Blood Ethanol Concentration Assay Following LORR, trunk blood was collected and serum was extracted as previously described in the PGE-m ELISA section. For the blood ethanol concentration determination, an EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (ECET-100, BioAssay Systems) was used. Standard protocols were followed for the determination using serum that was diluted 15X. OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader.Supplementary Material 1 PP2025.02.25.640044V1-supplement-1.pdf (837.1KB, pdf) Importance. Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is found in the gut of most individuals. C. albicans has been shown to contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Outside of this, the impact of intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, C. albicans, can alter mammalian ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E2. The results highlight novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Jesus Romo, Dr. Paola Zucchi, Dr. Ashlee Junier, Andressa Barossi Pesarini, Dr. Laura Markey, and Adrianne Gladden-Young for helpful discussion.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans–induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The presence of opportunistic pathogens in the normal flora of astronauts, in combination with their compromised immune system during spaceflight missions, puts this population at particular risk for infectious disease [1]–[4]. Candida species are commensal organisms that are found on human skin, in the oral cavity, and in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and vaginal tracts [5] and are consistently isolated from the spaceflight crew and environment [6]–[8]. These microorganisms become pathogenic under specific circumstances, which can lead to various infectious diseases ranging in severity from superficial mucous membrane infections (i.e., thrush) to life-threatening disseminated candidiasis [9]. Immunocompromised patients are at particular risk of developing Candida infections [9]. The risk for infectious diseases in astronauts becomes even more significant given previous reports that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the virulence and/or gene expression of obligate and opportunistic bacterial pathogens [10]–[12]. Two independent spaceflight experiments demonstrated that mice infected with spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) exhibited decreased time to death and LD50 values when compared to mice challenged with identical synchronous ground control cultures [11], [12]. Analysis of global transcriptomic and proteomic expression patterns of S. Typhimurium grown in spaceflight conditions revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins were altered during culture in the microgravity environment of spaceflight [11], and identified a central regulatory role for the evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq. Hfq is an Sm-like (LSm) RNA chaperone that serves as a master regulator of bacterial responses to environmental stress, primarily by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the pairing of mRNA transcripts with cognate small non-coding RNAs [13]–[19]. Spaceflight also alters the hfq regulon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [10], and is involved in the spaceflight-analogue response of S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [20]–[22]. Spaceflight-analogue conditions are obtained through culturing of microorganisms in rotating bioreactors, termed rotating wall vessels (RWV). In the RWV, cells experience low fluid-shear forces while being in continuous suspension, which mimics aspects of the unique microgravity environment [11], [23]–[25]. This specific growth environment is termed low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [22]. The response of eukaryotic microorganisms to spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue conditions has been previously reported. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied since the early years of the space program. The first flight experiment with this organism was conducted in 1962 (reviewed in [26]). Detailed analyses indicated that yeast cells responded to microgravity by undergoing metabolic (e.g. increase in phosphate uptake [27]) and phenotypic changes (e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars [28]–[30]). A recent report showed enhanced production of the biochemical molecule S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in spaceflight-cultured S. cerevisiae [31]. Knowledge gained from these studies led to the engineering of a SAM-overproducing strain of S. cerevisiae, with potential industrial applications. Moreover, studies describing the response of S. cerevisiae to spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV showed major phenotypic alterations in response to this environment [32]. Specifically, S. cerevisiae grown in LSMMG conditions displayed increased cell clumping (or flocculation) and a random budding phenotype as compared to the bipolar budding pattern of the same cells grown in the control orientation of the RWV bioreactor [32], [33]. While, to our knowledge, no reports exist on the response of C. albicans to culture under true spaceflight conditions, studies have documented the response of this organism to ground-based spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV [34], [35]. When C. albicans was cultured in LSMMG, this organism displayed increased randomness in the budding pattern, which is similar to the phenotype observed for S. cerevisiae during culture under the same conditions. In addition, while C. albicans existed as a predominantly yeast form when cultured under control conditions in the RWV bioreactor, increased filamentation and biofilm formation were observed when grown under LSMMG as determined by microscopy and morphology-specific gene expression profiling [34], [35]. C. albicans can transition from budding yeast to a filamentous (hyphal) form, which is responsive to environmental stressors and contributes to the organism's virulence [36]–[39]. Consistent with the conversion of C. albicans cells to a filamentous form, a concomitant increase in expression of filamentous-specific genes that are also suggestive of biofilm formation was observed in response to LSMMG [34], [35], [40], [41]. In addition to the importance of spaceflight research for infectious disease risk assessment during short and long-term missions, studying the behavior of C. albicans to spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue culture conditions has important clinical applications [42], [43]. Indeed, the low fluid shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed in spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures are relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their lifecycles on Earth, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host [42]–[45]. Since we currently lack a complete understanding of the infection process of this medically important pathogen and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to control C. albicans infections [40], [41], insights gained from microgravity research holds potential to discover new infectious disease mechanisms and benefit the general public on Earth. The current study describes the response of the most prominent fungal human pathogen, C. albicans, to spaceflight culture conditions, flown as part of the NASA Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-115. In this report, we analyzed the global transcriptional profile and performed phenotypic analysis of C. albicans during short-term growth in spaceflight conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effects of spaceflight culture on the global gene expression and phenotypic changes of a eukaryotic pathogen.",

    "results": "Results Gene expression General observations Whole genome expression profiling was used to identify gene expression alterations in C. albicans in response to culture in spaceflight conditions as compared to identical synchronous ground controls. The C. albicans microarrays used to assess differential gene expression between flight and ground samples included 6,346 of the 6,742 predicted ORFs annotated in assembly 19 of the C. albicans SC5314 genome (Table S1) [50]. Of those 6,346 ORFs, there were 5,432 that exhibited a robust response suitable for statistical analysis. Data analysis was restricted to genes that had high intensity on the array and were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold and a p-value <0.05. Of these, 452 (or 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs) were differentially expressed in response to spaceflight culture conditions; 279 were upregulated (61.7%), and 173 were downregulated (38.3%) in the flight samples as compared to ground controls ( Table 2 ).

While the function of many of the differentially regulated genes is currently unknown (not included in Table 3 and Figure 1 ), several categories of interest were found ( Table 3 ). Differentially expressed genes are presented in Table 3 as (i) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes in the genome assigned to category X, and (ii) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes differentially regulated by spaceflight. This classification indicated that spaceflight affects a broad range of cellular functions, ranging from biofilm formation to vesicle-mediated transport. It is worth noting that many genes are assigned to more than one category; therefore, the sum totals of the columns in Table 3 do not equal either the total number of genes in the genome or 100%.

Ten most represented functional categories affected by growth of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions. Open in a new tab The top ten of functional categories was determined by calculating (A) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes in the genome assigned to category X, and (B) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes differentially regulated by spaceflight.The ten functional categories with the greatest number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight expressed as a percent of assigned genes in the genome ( Figure 1A ) and/or the total number of differentially regulated genes ( Figure 1B ) include biofilm formation, cell adhesion, transport, interspecies interaction, response to chemical stimulus, response to stress, response to drugs, carbohydrate metabolism, and filamentous growth ( Table 3 , Figure 1 ). Next, we analyzed whether specific biological processes within our data set were significantly enriched, using GO Term Finder. Figure 2 presents the hierarchical ranking of the GO Term Finder Process categories that were significantly enriched (p<0.05). These categories include filamentous growth, carbohydrate metabolism, response to chemical stimulus, response to stress, and transport; which were also represented in the top ten categories identified with GO Slim Mapper ( Table 3 , Figure 1 ). Figure 2. Hierarchical ranking of the GO Term Finder Process categories that were significantly enriched. Open in a new tab Only categories that are significantly enriched (p<0.05) are presented, except for those labeled grey added for hierarchical purposes. Subcategories with more than 2 higher rank categories that were not significantly enriched are not included in this figure (i.e., dicarboxylic acid transport and copper ion transport). For clarity purposes, categories with more than one connector are not presented, if the connecting category/categories was/were not significantly enriched. Color codes indicate p-values.Categories that were significantly enriched by spaceflight culture ( Figure 2 ) and are of particular interest for this study given their direct role in the infectious disease process are response to stress and filamentation. In addition, we were interested in differentially regulated genes involved in (i) biofilm formation, cell aggregation, and random budding given our phenotypic observations (described below), and (ii) response to drugs and RNA binding given previous findings from C. albicans and other microbial pathogens cultured in spaceflight and/or spaceflight-analogue culture systems [11], [12], [35]. These specific categories are analyzed in greater detail below. While these categories were initially identified using the set criteria of significance (p<0.05, fold-change >2), the number of genes belonging to pathways within these specific targeted categories of interest was enlarged using less stringent criteria (p<0.07 or fold-change >1.5, indicated with †). To validate the microarray data, qRT-PCR analysis of a targeted selection of genes that were differentially regulated with microarray was performed. Expression of the target genes (ALS1, CAP1, ERG6, YTH1, HSP31, GPX2) was normalized using the averaged expression of four housekeeping genes (ACT1, PMA1, RIP, RPP2B) [52]. All analyzed genes were found differentially regulated with qRT-PCR in the same direction as found with microarray analysis, and for four out of six analyzed genes, the differential regulation was significant (p<0.05 or p<0.01) ( Table 4 ).

Genes involved in biofilm formation/filamentation that were differentially expressed in spaceflight conditions include TUP1 (†), ALS1, CPH1 (†), AOX2 (†), and ORF19.4653. The latter gene was upregulated 7.5-fold in spaceflight, and is one of the ten most induced genes in the microarray. Interestingly, expression of the yeast-specific gene Yeast Wall Protein 1 (YWP1) was significantly induced in spaceflight samples, which promotes the non-filamentous phenotype of C. albicans under conventional culture conditions [59]. Additional genes involved in C. albicans biofilm formation (as determined by the GO Slim Mapper) that were differentially regulated by spaceflight include BRG1, MCR1, RHR2, and SHA3 [50]. Additional spaceflight-induced genes involved in hyphal growth (as determined by the GO Slim Mapper) include FGR16, ARC40, RFX2, SHA3, SPT5, STE13, TCA5, VID27, and orf19.1617 [50]. Next, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in the production of biofilm-associated extracellular matrix proteins. The gene encoding the glucanosyltransferase Phr1 (†), involved in glucan modification [60] was significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. As indicated by light microscopy and flow cytometry (see below), spaceflight-grown C. albicans showed enhanced self-aggregation as compared to ground controls. Since the observed cell aggregation in spaceflight-grown C. albicans structurally resembles the well-characterized flocculation phenotype of S. cerevisiae, we investigated whether genes involved in flocculation were differentially expressed. The cell surface glycoprotein Als1, which is both involved in self-aggregation of C. albicans and has both structural and functional similarity to the main flocculation protein Flo11 in S. cerevisiae [61], [62], was induced in spaceflight conditions. In addition, a gene encoding a protein similar to cell surface flocculin (HYR10) (†) was induced in spaceflight cultures. Genes involved in the three main flocculation regulatory pathways (based on the well-characterized S. cerevisiae) were found to be differentially regulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. For MAPK-dependent filamentous growth, these genes were TPK1 (†) (Ras-cAMP pathway), the ammonium permease Mep2, and the transcriptional regulator CPH1 (homolog of Ste12 in S. cerevisiae) (†). For the glucose repression pathway, these genes were HXT3 (†), HXT5, HGT1 and HGT2 (all hexose transporters).Stress and drug resistance A significant portion of genes within the stress/drug response categories were related to oxidative stress resistance. The gene encoding the oxidative stress response transcriptional regulator, Cap1, was significantly induced in response to spaceflight culture. Interestingly, more than 30% of the previously reported Cap1 regulon [63] was affected by culture of C. albicans under spaceflight conditions in this study. This includes genes under positive Cap1 control: TRX1, SOD1, PDR16 (†), IFR1, ARR3, orf19.7042, ARO9 (†), YIM1, RIB1 (†), orf19.1162 (†), ADH6, ESBP6, HGT2, orf19.6464 (†); and negative Cap1 control: MNN13, VMA10 (†), CHA2 (†). Among these 17 genes, 13 were expressed in the expected direction (i.e., TRX1, IFR1, ARR3, orf19.7042, ARO9, YIM1, RIB1, orf19.1162, ESPB6, HGT2, MNN13, VMA10, and CHA2). Additional spaceflight-induced genes identified in this study that have been reported to play a role in the oxidative stress response of C. albicans via Cap1 are GZF3 and orf19.2498 [50]. Other genes involved in the oxidative stress resistance of C. albicans that were induced in spaceflight include GPX1 and GPX2, which encode glutathione peroxidases; and SOD3, which encodes a superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, genes encoding the heat shock proteins Hsp10, Hsp30, Hsp31, Hsp60, Hsp78, Mdj1, Ssc1, orf19.9899 (putative heat shock protein), and Sti1 were significantly upregulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans cultures. In addition, spaceflight cultures of C. albicans showed significant upregulation of genes encoding ABC transporters and major facilitators, which are two main classes of drug transporters in C. albicans. These include CDR1 (†), CDR4, CDR12, HOL4, HOL2 (†), ORF19.4779, YOR1 (†), and orf19.10632 (possible ABC transporter). Spaceflight cultures also showed significant downregulation of the ergosterol-encoding genes ERG6 and ERG25 (reviewed in [64]), of which ERG6 has been shown previously to be important for amphotericin B resistance (a polyene) in C. glabatra [65], [66].Bud site selection and cytoskeleton Since we observed a higher abundance of random budding in C. albicans cultures exposed to spaceflight using SEM analysis (see below), we screened the microarray results for differential expression of genes involved in unipolar, axial, and random budding, as identified by Ni et al. for S. cerevisiae [67]. With the exception of the downregulation of ALG5 and BUD7, which are involved in unipolar and axial budding respectively, a significant number of differentially expressed genes following spaceflight culture were involved in random budding. These differentially expressed genes were classified in the categories of vesicular transport (downregulation of CLC1, VMA5 (†), VPS34 (†), VAC7 (†), END3 (†), LUV1 (†), VPS45 (†), SEC22), actin cytoskeleton (downregulation of SLA1 (†)), cell wall proteins (upregulation of GAS1), lipid metabolism (downregulation of FEN1 (†)), protein modification (downregulation of PMT2 (†), OST3; upregulation of MAP1), transcriptional proteins (upregulation of CTK1 (†) and TUP1 (†)), nuclear proteins (downregulation of TRF4 (†); upregulation of NPL3 (†), SFP1 (†)), and other proteins (downregulation of ATP14 (†) and ILM1 (†)). Interestingly, induction of the gene encoding the daughter-cell specific transcription factor Ace2 [68] was observed for spaceflight samples of C. albicans. Accordingly, downregulation of the gene encoding the G1 cyclin Cln3, which is under the negative control of Ace2, was observed [69]. Given the essential role of the actin cytoskeleton in random budding and previous findings that microgravity profoundly affects the mammalian cytoskeleton [70], we screened our microarray data for additional genes involved in the actin cytoskeletal organization [50]. We discovered significant downregulation of several key genes involved in actin polymerization and organization, including PFY1 (†), SLY1 (†), FAC1 (†), ACF2, AIP1 (†), AND SDA1 (†). Accordingly, differences in cell size and shape were observed when C. albicans was grown in spaceflight and ground conditions (see below).RNA-binding proteins A high percentage of differentially expressed genes in the GO Slim Mapper analysis were assigned to categories related to metabolism ( Table 3 ). We were particularly interested in genes assigned to ‘RNA metabolic processes’ (GO:0016070) based on the identification of the RNA binding protein Hfq as a global regulator of microgravity and/or microgravity-analogue culture induced responses in S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus [11], [20], [21]. The eukaryotic LSm proteins share structural and functional similarities with their prokaryotic counterpart, Hfq [71], [72]. The gene encoding LSm2 (†) was the only LSm family member observed to be differentially expressed in response to spaceflight culture under the conditions of this study. We considered the possibility that other RNA-binding proteins may be differentially expressed upon exposure to microgravity; therefore, the GO Slim Mapper ‘function’ category of RNA-binding proteins was investigated, which allowed us to identify 12 additional genes involved in RNA binding whose expression was significantly altered in response to microgravity culture, i.e., PRP39, SPT5, STI1, TCA5, YTH1, orf19.2610, orf19.265, orf19.3114, orf19.3547, orf19.4479, and orf19.6008. Interestingly, the genes encoding Yth1, Prp39, Spt5, Sti1, and Tca5 have been associated with hyphal formation [50]. Morphological analyses Light microscopic analysis revealed enhanced cellular aggregation in flight samples as compared to synchronous ground controls ( Figure 3 ). While both flight and ground cultures showed cell clumping and occasional filamentation, cell cluster formation was more pronounced in flight samples of C. albicans. Based on microscopic imaging, spaceflight samples contained more cell clusters and their average size was larger compared to synchronous ground controls (1.7-fold, 10±3 cells per cluster for flight samples versus 6±1 cells per cluster for ground samples). In both test conditions, some cell clusters contained one filament ( Figure 4A , black arrow). Figure 4 shows 2500×, 5000× and 8000× SEM images of cell clusters from flight (A, B, C) and ground samples (a, b, c) respectively. Figure 3.

Open in a new tab Cell clusters of spaceflight (A, B) and ground control (a, b) conditions are shown. Black arrow points to filament, white arrows indicate aberrant cell shapes, grey arrows indicate normal bipolar budding, and white dotted arrows indicate random budding scars. Magnification = 5,000× for A and a, and 8,000× for B and b. C and c show images of spaceflight and ground control cells respectively at lower magnification (2,500×) to demonstrate the difference in space occupancy between the test conditions (3D architecture for spaceflight compared to flat structure for ground cultures). C. albicans ground samples exhibited a higher number of cells with a bipolar budding pattern (reflected by ongoing budding and budding scars), while more cells with multiple, randomly distributed budding scars were observed for spaceflight cultures ( Figure 4A and a, white dotted arrows). Accordingly, genes involved in random budding of C. albicans were significantly affected by spaceflight culture. Since the multiple budding phenotype could indicate the generation of more daughter cells that are typically smaller, the cell surface area, width and length were determined for C. albicans cells grown in ground or spaceflight conditions, respectively. The average surface area for ground samples (6.6±3.0 µm2) was significantly higher than for flight samples (4.6±2.4 µm2) (1.4-fold, p<10−9). In addition, Figure 5A shows that a higher percentage of cells with a smaller surface area was observed for spaceflight cultures. For example, 80% of the spaceflight cells versus only 47% of ground cells had a surface area smaller than 5 µm2 ( Figure 5A ). To assess cell shape, we determined the width-to-length ratio. Ground control cells had a higher percentage of cells with a ratio above 0.8 (67.8% for ground versus 30.5% for spaceflight), indicating that more C. albicans cells grown in control conditions had a rounder morphology ( Figure 5B ). It is important to note that ground control cells appeared more flat, compared to spaceflight cells, which showed a 3D organization ( Figure 4C versus 4c). This could potentially explain, at least in part, a larger surface area for ground control cultures. Also, the increased presence of aberrant yeast forms was observed in spaceflight samples ( Figure 4A and a, white arrow). The aberrant yeast forms in panels A and a are reminiscent of dying cells. However, post-flight viable cell counts indicated no differences between cultures exposed to microgravity and synchronous ground controls (i.e., 4.78×107 CFU/mL for flight samples and 5.94×107 CFU/mL for ground samples).

Results were obtained based on surface area and width-to-length determination of 143 ground control cells and 197 spaceflight-cultured cells.Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a 2.8-fold increase (p<0.025) in forward scatter signal for spaceflight-grown C. albicans ( Figure 6 ), which is reflective of the observed increases in cell aggregation in spaceflight samples. Figure 6. Flow cytometry analysis of C. albicans flight samples and ground controls. Open in a new tab Panel A represents a dot plot of C. albicans yeast cells grown at 30°C (to set the threshold for non-flocculated organisms). Panels B and C illustrate dot plots of ground and flight samples respectively. The Y-axis represents side-scatter and the X-axis forward scatter (FSC). Events with FSC values below the established threshold were considered single or budding yeast, whereas events above the established threshold were considered cell clusters. Virulence Due to limited sample availability, a focused study to determine the effect of spaceflight culture on C. albicans virulence was performed by infecting mice via the i.p. route with a single infection dose grown under spaceflight/ground control conditions and monitoring the time to death. This targeted study indicated no differences between the virulence of spaceflight and ground cultures, as reflected in comparable mouse survival in both test conditions (Figure S2).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The presence of the opportunistic fungus C. albicans in the normal flora of astronauts could present an infectious disease risk during long-term missions. Indeed, microorganisms have been shown to enhance their virulence and/or display virulence-related phenotypes in response to culture in the low fluid-shear environment of both microgravity and microgravity-analogue culture systems [10]–[12], [20]–[22], [24], [34], [35], [73]–[79]. Moreover, as C. albicans causes a variety of mucosal and deep tissue infections in immunosuppressed patients [9], the decreased immune response of astronauts in-flight could further contribute to an increased susceptibility to microbial infections [1]. In addition to the application of spaceflight microbiology studies for infectious disease risk assessment in the astronaut population, these studies also entail applications to advance human health on Earth. Complementing conventional infectious disease research with spaceflight studies can serve to bridge gaps in our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions, given the unique ways in which both the host and pathogen respond to this extreme environment [1], [2], [24]. The low fluid-shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed during liquid culture in spaceflight and spaceflight analogues is relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their normal terrestrial lifecycles, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host [3], [42]–[45]. Thus, studying the responses of microbial cells to the microgravity environment of spaceflight holds potential for the discovery of novel infectious disease mechanisms that cannot be observed using conventional culture conditions, where the force of gravity can mask key cellular responses. This study demonstrated that spaceflight culturing induced a self-aggregative phenotype (resembling the flocculation phenotype of S. cerevisiae) in C. albicans and altered a plethora of genes involved in stress and drug resistance; which is important for the virulence of this organism. The high prevalence of differentially expressed genes involved in biofilm formation and filamentation of C. albicans in response to spaceflight culture suggests that the microscopically observed self-aggregative phenotype could be reflective of biofilms. Indeed, transcriptional regulation of biofilm formation and filamentation is intertwined in C. albicans, and an increased flocculation phenotype is believed to be the result of hyphae-specific gene expression [80]. C. albicans biofilm formation is divided into four distinct phases: (i) surface adhesion and colonization by yeast-form, spherical cells, (ii) microcolony formation on the attached surface by yeast-form cells, (iii) growth of pseudohyphae and hyphae in concert with synthesis of extracellular matrix, and (iv) dispersal of yeast-form cells to initiate biofilm formation off-site [53], . Microcolony formation on abiotic surfaces (structurally similar to flocculation) is estimated to take place 3–4 hours after initial adhesion, while formation of pseudohyphae and hyphae occurs at later time points (12–30 hours) [54]. We hypothesize that at the 25-hour time point of fixation in this study (for gene expression/microscopic analysis), C. albicans may have been in the process of transitioning to the hyphal biofilm stage, which was not yet translated at the phenotypic level. In support of this hypothesis is the previous finding that C. albicans grown in LSMMG conditions exerted increased biofilm formation and biofilm-associated filamentation after long-term culture in the RWV bioreactor (4–5 days) [35]. In microgravity-analogue conditions, biofilm formation was observed on the gas-permeable siliconized rubber membranes of RWV bioreactors, while in spaceflight samples, self-aggregation of microbial cells was observed. Interestingly, flocculation of S. cerevisiae has also been reported in LSMMG conditions, but detailed analysis of gene expression was not performed [32]. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus grown in LSMMG also displayed self-aggregative biofilm phenotypes [20], [73], and S. Typhimurium formed biofilms during spaceflight culture [11]. For C. albicans, key regulators of filamentation that were differentially regulated by long term culture in LSMMG (i.e., repression of YWP1, induction of HWP1 and BCR1) were not differentially expressed in shorter term spaceflight-grown C. albicans; although the gene encoding the cell surface glycoprotein Als1 showed significant induction in both spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures. Als1 is functionally and structurally similar to the major flocculation protein in S. cerevisiae, Flo11, and is an effector of filamentation, and a mediator of adherence and flocculation [62]. The transcriptional regulation of self-aggregation has extensively been studied in S. cerevisiae given the associated industrial applications of this phenotype. Three main pathways have been proposed to regulate flocculation (via Flo11) in S. cerevisiae: (i) Ras-cAMP, (ii) MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent filamentous growth, and (iii) main glucose repression pathway [82]. In this regard, genes involved in the three main flocculation regulatory pathways were also found differentially regulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. Therefore, Als1 could be a key mediator in the observed spaceflight-induced self-aggregative phenotype of C. albicans. We also examined the expression of genes involved in the production of biofilm extracellular matrix proteins. While the complete composition and transcriptional regulation of the extracellular matrix of C. albicans biofilms remains to be unveiled, studies have shown the presence of carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acid components [83]–[85]. A recent study identified three glucan modifying genes that play a role in glucan incorporation in the biofilm matrix [60], one of which, glucanosyltransferase (Phr1), was significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. Another morphological change that was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans was the presence of an increased number of cells with random budding scars as compared to more cells with a bipolar budding pattern for synchronous ground controls. This phenotype was also observed for S. cerevisiae exposed to spaceflight culture conditions [28]–[30]. Polarized cell division is essential for the development of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and typically takes place at the distal cell poles (180° from the birth site), termed bipolar budding, or at the proximal cell poles (adjacent to the preceding site of cytokinesis), termed axial budding [86], [87]. Bipolar budding is believed to maximize nutrient exposure of the growing yeast cells [86], while axial budding facilitates mating and diploid formation [88]. Specific mutations and environmental conditions cause random budding which is associated with loss of cell polarity, as reflected in a round cell morphology and cell separation deficiency, associated with production of cell clumps [87], [89]. As described above, enhanced cell clumping was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans. In agreement with the random budding phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight cultures, multiple genes involved in random budding of yeast were significantly affected. Interestingly, the enhanced presence of multiple budding scars could indicate the generation of more daughter cells in spaceflight conditions, which is supported by the smaller cell size of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans, and at the transcriptional level, by the induction of the daughter-cell specific transcription factor ACE2 and downregulation of the G1 cyclin CLN3 in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (see above) [68]. In yeast, asymmetric cell division results in the generation of smaller daughter cells as compared to the mother cell [90]. Since the regulation of the G1 cycle is, in part, dependent on cell size; daughter cells require additional growth before the Start transition in G1. This process is orchestrated by a cell size-sensing module, in which Cln3 is the main regulator [91]. The daughter-cell specific transcription factor, Ace2, has a direct negative regulatory effect on the expression of CLN3, which plays a role in delaying the G1 phase in daughter cells [69]. The enhanced presence of daughter cells could also indicate differential growth rate of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions. While at the time point of analysis, no differences in viable cell counts were recorded, more detailed monitoring of growth profiles are needed to determine if C. albicans altered its generation time in flight. It was hypothesized by Walther et al. that the random budding pattern in spaceflight cultures of S. cerevisiae could be explained by microgravity-induced changes in the cytoskeleton, which has been reported for a variety of mammalian cells (reviewed in [70]). Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton is essential for bud site selection, and mutants in actin organization exert a random budding phenotype [67]. In accordance with Walther and colleagues, we found that C. albicans exposed to spaceflight culture conditions downregulated several key genes involved in the actin organization and polymerization. Several mechanisms of drug resistance have been described for C. albicans yeast cells, including differential expression of drug targets, efflux pump-mediated drug transport, and utilization of compensatory and catabolic pathways [64], [95]. Biofilm formation confers additional resistance in C. albicans through increased cell density, production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the presence of persisters [64], [96]. In this study, genes encoding ABC transporters and multidrug efflux proteins (major facilitator family) were induced in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (such as CDR1, CDR4, CDR12), which are involved in resistance to different classes of antifungals including polyenes (e.g. amphotericin B) and azoles. Also, spaceflight cultures of C. albicans showed downregulation of genes encoding ergosterol (ERG6, ERG25), which is a major drug target for this organism. Ergosterol is uniquely present in the membranes of yeast and fungal cells, and polyenes specifically target ergosterol in the fungal membrane, which creates pores and results in cell death [95]. Downregulation of ergosterol levels in the cell membrane of sessile or biofilm-forming C. albicans contributes to the resistance of this organism to both polyene and azole antifungal agents. Interestingly, enhanced resistance of LSMMG-cultured C. albicans to amphotericin B was previously observed, which increased with the time of incubation under these microgravity-analogue conditions [35]. In addition, S. Typhimurium showed induction of outer membrane porins, ABC transporters, and other genes involved in antibiotic resistance in response to culture in spaceflight conditions [11]. Whether the observed differences in gene expression translate to a phenotype of C. albicans that is more resistant to antifungal drug agents remains to be determined. We observed that a significant number of genes differentially regulated in response to spaceflight culture were involved in the oxidative stress resistance of C. albicans. Cap1 presumably played a role in the oxidative stress-associated gene expression since it has been shown to be involved in the oxidative stress response of C. albicans [63], and more than 30% of the Cap1 regulon was affected by spaceflight. It would seem unlikely that increased gene expression related to oxidative stress resistance is due to the presence of increased oxygen levels since previously reported gene expression profiles of bacterial FPA cultures exposed to spaceflight indicated responses to microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions, presumably due to low fluid-shear levels and/or limited mixing in microgravity [10], [11], [79]. In correspondence with our data, the spaceflight-induced proteome of S. cerevisiae comprised multiple proteins involved in oxidative stress [30]. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that growth of S. cerevisiae in spaceflight in hyperoxic conditions resulted in extracellular release of glutathione [29]. The observed increase in glutathione release was suggested to have occurred through activation of ion channels in response to cytoskeletal rearrangements in microgravity culture conditions [29]. Spaceflight has been shown to modulate oxidative functions in other eukaryotic cell types, animal models, and astronauts [29], [97]–[102]. Collectively, our data indicate a potentially increased resistance of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans to antimicrobial agents and environmental stressors as compared to ground controls, which would need to be confirmed at the phenotypic level during future studies. Despite the induction of a virulence-related phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions, we did not observe significant differences in virulence, as determined using an i.p. mouse model of infection. This observation could potentially be explained by the route of infection, the use of only a single lethal dose of C. albicans for the inoculation, and the short-term exposure to spaceflight. Indeed, i.p. infection is not a standard infection method for C. albicans, and was chosen given the unique time constraints associated with the spaceflight experiment. Alternatively, it is possible that spaceflight culture does not impact the virulence of C. albicans. Additional studies are needed to conclusively determine if spaceflight alters C. albicans virulence. Since the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, was previously identified as a major regulator of the microgravity and/or microgravity-analogue response of S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus [21], we investigated the influence of spaceflight on expression of the LSm family of RNA-binding proteins in C. albicans, which are evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic homologues of Hfq [103]. The gene encoding the LSm2 protein was the only LSm family member that was significantly affected by spaceflight culture of C. albicans under the conditions of this study. LSm2 is part of (i) the cytoplasmic LSm1-7 complex, which is important for mRNA decapping and decay, and (ii) the nuclear LSm2-8 complex, which is important for pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing [104]–[107]. In response to stress, there is a rapid shift of LSm proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the LSm1-7 complex concentrates within granular foci called processing bodies (P-bodies) [104]–[108]. To our knowledge, the role of LSm2 in the transcriptional regulation, virulence and behavior of C. albicans is unknown. Whether LSm2 regulation is involved in the spaceflight response of C. albicans, supporting a conserved transcriptional regulation between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, needs to be assessed in follow-up studies. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the gene expression profile of a eukaryotic pathogen and could potentially induce a virulence-related phenotype, and represents an initial step towards the infectious disease risk assessment of C. albicans during spaceflight missions. The effect of longer-term microgravity cultivation on the biofilm formation, filamentation and virulence phenotype of C. albicans, together with investigation of the potential spaceflight-activated transcriptional regulator Cap1 identified in this study is of interest for future research. Moreover, this study further reinforces the role that physical forces in the human body, such as low fluid-shear, could play in the infection process; insights that hold promise to fundamentally advance our understanding of infectious disease on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 3851762 PMID: 24324620 Abstract This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans–induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.Introduction The presence of opportunistic pathogens in the normal flora of astronauts, in combination with their compromised immune system during spaceflight missions, puts this population at particular risk for infectious disease [1]–[4]. Candida species are commensal organisms that are found on human skin, in the oral cavity, and in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and vaginal tracts [5] and are consistently isolated from the spaceflight crew and environment [6]–[8]. These microorganisms become pathogenic under specific circumstances, which can lead to various infectious diseases ranging in severity from superficial mucous membrane infections (i.e., thrush) to life-threatening disseminated candidiasis [9]. Immunocompromised patients are at particular risk of developing Candida infections [9]. The risk for infectious diseases in astronauts becomes even more significant given previous reports that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the virulence and/or gene expression of obligate and opportunistic bacterial pathogens [10]–[12]. Two independent spaceflight experiments demonstrated that mice infected with spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) exhibited decreased time to death and LD50 values when compared to mice challenged with identical synchronous ground control cultures [11], [12]. Analysis of global transcriptomic and proteomic expression patterns of S. Typhimurium grown in spaceflight conditions revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins were altered during culture in the microgravity environment of spaceflight [11], and identified a central regulatory role for the evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq. Hfq is an Sm-like (LSm) RNA chaperone that serves as a master regulator of bacterial responses to environmental stress, primarily by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the pairing of mRNA transcripts with cognate small non-coding RNAs [13]–[19]. Spaceflight also alters the hfq regulon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [10], and is involved in the spaceflight-analogue response of S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [20]–[22]. Spaceflight-analogue conditions are obtained through culturing of microorganisms in rotating bioreactors, termed rotating wall vessels (RWV). In the RWV, cells experience low fluid-shear forces while being in continuous suspension, which mimics aspects of the unique microgravity environment [11], [23]–[25]. This specific growth environment is termed low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [22]. The response of eukaryotic microorganisms to spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue conditions has been previously reported. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied since the early years of the space program. The first flight experiment with this organism was conducted in 1962 (reviewed in [26]). Detailed analyses indicated that yeast cells responded to microgravity by undergoing metabolic (e.g. increase in phosphate uptake [27]) and phenotypic changes (e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars [28]–[30]). A recent report showed enhanced production of the biochemical molecule S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in spaceflight-cultured S. cerevisiae [31]. Knowledge gained from these studies led to the engineering of a SAM-overproducing strain of S. cerevisiae, with potential industrial applications. Moreover, studies describing the response of S. cerevisiae to spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV showed major phenotypic alterations in response to this environment [32]. Specifically, S. cerevisiae grown in LSMMG conditions displayed increased cell clumping (or flocculation) and a random budding phenotype as compared to the bipolar budding pattern of the same cells grown in the control orientation of the RWV bioreactor [32], [33]. While, to our knowledge, no reports exist on the response of C. albicans to culture under true spaceflight conditions, studies have documented the response of this organism to ground-based spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV [34], [35]. When C. albicans was cultured in LSMMG, this organism displayed increased randomness in the budding pattern, which is similar to the phenotype observed for S. cerevisiae during culture under the same conditions. In addition, while C. albicans existed as a predominantly yeast form when cultured under control conditions in the RWV bioreactor, increased filamentation and biofilm formation were observed when grown under LSMMG as determined by microscopy and morphology-specific gene expression profiling [34], [35]. C. albicans can transition from budding yeast to a filamentous (hyphal) form, which is responsive to environmental stressors and contributes to the organism's virulence [36]–[39]. Consistent with the conversion of C. albicans cells to a filamentous form, a concomitant increase in expression of filamentous-specific genes that are also suggestive of biofilm formation was observed in response to LSMMG [34], [35], [40], [41]. In addition to the importance of spaceflight research for infectious disease risk assessment during short and long-term missions, studying the behavior of C. albicans to spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue culture conditions has important clinical applications [42], [43]. Indeed, the low fluid shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed in spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures are relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their lifecycles on Earth, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host [42]–[45]. Since we currently lack a complete understanding of the infection process of this medically important pathogen and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to control C. albicans infections [40], [41], insights gained from microgravity research holds potential to discover new infectious disease mechanisms and benefit the general public on Earth. The current study describes the response of the most prominent fungal human pathogen, C. albicans, to spaceflight culture conditions, flown as part of the NASA Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-115. In this report, we analyzed the global transcriptional profile and performed phenotypic analysis of C. albicans during short-term growth in spaceflight conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effects of spaceflight culture on the global gene expression and phenotypic changes of a eukaryotic pathogen.Experimental Procedures Ethics statement Research was conducted in compliance with applicable animal care guidelines at the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) under approved NASA KSC IACUC Protocol # FLT-06-050.Strains, media and growth conditions C. albicans strain SC5314 was used in all experiments. Prior to flight, 6×106 cells grown in YPD medium were suspended in 0.5 mL sterile ddH2O and loaded into specialized spaceflight hardware, termed Fluid Processing Apparatuses (FPA) (Figure S1), as described previously [10]. Briefly, growth was initiated in flight (nine days post launch) by addition of 2 mL YPD to the fungal suspension (termed activation). Cultures were grown in spaceflight conditions or synchronous ground control conditions for 25 hours at ambient temperature (23°C). Subsequently, cells were fixed for RNA, proteins and morphological imaging by addition of 2.5 mL RNA Later II reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) (termed termination). For infection studies, assessment of cell viability and fixation for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 2.5 mL YPD medium was added instead of RNA Later II fixative. All samples were returned at ambient temperature, and Shuttle landing occurred 12 days post launch. Two and a half hours after landing at Kennedy Space Center, the culture samples fixed in RNA Later II were recovered, removed from the FPA, and stored at −80°C. The viable cell samples were counted by plating on solid medium. A portion of the sample was fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde (16%; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for SEM analysis, and the remainder of the sample was immediately used for virulence studies in mice. For all studies, flight cultures were compared to synchronous control cultures grown under identical conditions on the ground at Kennedy Space Center using coordinated activation and termination times (via real time communications with the Shuttle crew) in an insulated room that maintained identical temperature and humidity as on the Shuttle (Orbital Environmental Simulator) (synchronous ground controls).Virulence The C. albicans dose for infection was obtained by pooling samples from eight FPAs for either flight or ground control samples, respectively, followed by centrifugation (1500 g, 5 min) and resuspension in sterile PBS. Six to eight week old female Balb/c mice (housed in the Animal Facility at the Space Life Sciences Lab at Kennedy Space Center) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) (Kretschmar et al., 1999) with a single lethal dose (1×108) of C. albicans cells harvested from either spaceflight (within 2.5 hours after Shuttle landing) or synchronous ground cultures that were resuspended in 0.5 mL sterile PBS [11]. Ten mice were used per test condition and infected mice were monitored every 6–12 hours for 14 days.Microscopy All electron microscopy was performed on an XL30 FEI/Philips environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). As mentioned above, flight and ground samples were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde post-landing and stored at 4°C until processing and analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were placed in filtration units containing a polycarbonate membrane with 0.4 µm pore size (Poretics Corporation), gently rinsed three times in filter-sterilized milli-Q water, and then dehydrated with graded alcohol series to 100% ethanol. The polycarbonate filters containing the cells were placed on double-sided carbon tape that was mounted onto stubs and dried overnight in a dry chamber. Next, samples were sputter coated with gold-palladium prior to imaging. Image J (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was used to determine the average cell length/width and surface area, based on the analysis of 143 and 197 cells imaged with SEM for ground and spaceflight samples respectively. The individual cell measurements are provided as supplemental data (Table S1). Light microscopic analysis was performed on RNA Later II-fixed samples, using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (magnification 100, 400× and 630×). Two biological replicates for flight and ground cultures were imaged. To determine average cell cluster size, five random images at magnification 100× were analyzed per biological replicate and per condition. Cells within the ten largest cell clusters were counted per image, and the average over the five microscopic images was determined.Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). C. albicans flight and ground cultures (biological duplicate), stored in RNA later II at −80°C were diluted in PBS and subjected to analysis by flow cytometry. A forward scatter threshold was established at 700 to distinguish yeast cells from cell clusters. A population of yeast cells grown in liquid culture at 30°C (no cell clusters) was used to establish this threshold, in which at least 99% of the yeast population fell below the threshold. As forward scatter is proportional to cell size, events with forward scatter greater than the established threshold were considered cell aggregates. For each sample, 10,000 events were acquired at an analysis rate of approximately 500 events per second. All data analysis was performed with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson).RNA extraction, quantification and microarray analysis Four independent flight and ground samples were thawed and cells were counted manually using a hemocytometer. Yeast cells were disrupted by homogenization in the presence of glass beads in a Mini-Beadbeater-8™ (Biospec Products) and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). RNA quality and quantity were evaluated using the Nanodrop technology (Thermo Scientific) and an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were processed at the Microarray Core Facility at Washington University (St. Louis, MO) [46], [47]. Briefly, first strand cDNA was generated by oligo-dT primed reverse transcription (Superscript II; Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA expression level comparison, samples were paired and concentrated using Microcon YM30 microconcentrators (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next, each sample pair was resuspended in Formamide-based hybridization buffer (vial 7-Genisphere), Array 50 dT blocker (Genisphere), and RNase/DNase-free water. Primary and secondary hybridizations were carried out in a sequential manner following standard protocols [46], [47]. A dye-swap analysis was performed as well, and the data was not significantly different from the data set with the initial dye choice. To prevent fluorophore degradation, the arrays were treated with Dyesaver (Genisphere). Slides were scanned on a Perkin Elmer ScanArray Express HT scanner to detect Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence. Laser power is kept constant for Cy3/Cy5 scans and PMT is varied for each experiment based on optimal signal intensity with lowest possible background fluorescence. Gridding and analysis of images was performed using ScanArray v3.0 (Perkin Elmer). Background intensity values were imported into Partek Genomic Suite (Partek, Inc.). The median value of each set of replicate spots from each array was used. Data was log2 transformed and quantile normalized [48]. Three-way ANOVA analysis was then performed on the data using treatment (flight vs. ground), dye, and experimental data as factors. Flight to ground linear contrast was performed with ANOVA. False Discovery Rate was controlled using the Step Up method [49]. Analysis was initially restricted to genes that had high intensity on the array and were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold with a confidence interval of 95%. Where indicated, genes with less than a 2.0 fold increase and less than a 95% confidence interval were considered. While the gene expression list was initially based on predicted ORFs annotated in assembly 19 of the C. albicans SC5314 genome, it was updated according to the most recent version (assembly 21) at CGD, with regard to gene model merges and gene deletions. The full description of the microarray analysis and the complete microarray data set have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website under accession number GSE50881. The Candida Genome Database (CGD) Gene Ontology (GO) Slim Mapper was used to group differentially expressed genes according to function (biological process). In order to determine statistical significance of enriched categories, the GO Term Finder was used [50]. For the GO Term Finder analysis, the data set was filtered for genes with GO annotations (i.e., 273 out of 452 genes). The GO Term Finder ‘process’ categorization was utilized for these studies unless otherwise noted.Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis RNA was isolated as described above. One microgram RNA per sample was converted to cDNA using the MonsterscriptTM 1st-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Epicenter), and subsequently diluted ten times in nuclease-free water. Quantitect SYBR Green Master mix (Qiagen) was used to assess differential gene expression with quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), according to the manufacturer's protocol. An overview of primers used in this study is provided in Table 1 . The qRT-PCR reactions were performed in a RealPlex 2 system (Eppendorf). A melting curve was run at the end of each reaction to test for the presence of a single PCR product. The qRT-PCR reaction product was run on a 3% agarose gel in the presence of a low molecular weight DNA ladder (BioLabs), to assess primer specificity. CT values were exported using the Eppendorf Database tool, where after the delta delta CT method [51] was adopted to determine relative gene expression between different test conditions. The average of four housekeeping genes was used for normalization (ACT1, PMA1, RIP, RPP2B) [52]. All chosen housekeeping genes were not differentially expressed based on microarray analysis. Two biological replicates of C. albicans grown in spaceflight and ground control conditions were analyzed with qRT-PCR in technical duplicate. Table 1. Primers used for qRT-PCR analysis.

The C. albicans microarrays used to assess differential gene expression between flight and ground samples included 6,346 of the 6,742 predicted ORFs annotated in assembly 19 of the C. albicans SC5314 genome (Table S1) [50]. Of those 6,346 ORFs, there were 5,432 that exhibited a robust response suitable for statistical analysis. Data analysis was restricted to genes that had high intensity on the array and were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold and a p-value <0.05. Of these, 452 (or 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs) were differentially expressed in response to spaceflight culture conditions; 279 were upregulated (61.7%), and 173 were downregulated (38.3%) in the flight samples as compared to ground controls ( Table 2 ).

evaluate global, high-level changes in gene expression, differentially expressed genes were classified into Biological Process categories ( Table 3 ), using GO Slim Mapper (September 12, 2013 version) [50]. While the function of many of the differentially regulated genes is currently unknown (not included in Table 3 and Figure 1 ), several categories of interest were found ( Table 3 ). Differentially expressed genes are presented in Table 3 as (i) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes in the genome assigned to category X, and (ii) the ratio of the number of genes in category X to the total number of genes differentially regulated by spaceflight. This classification indicated that spaceflight affects a broad range of cellular functions, ranging from biofilm formation to vesicle-mediated transport. It is worth noting that many genes are assigned to more than one category; therefore, the sum totals of the columns in Table 3 do not equal either the total number of genes in the genome or 100%.

Next, we analyzed whether specific biological processes within our data set were significantly enriched, using GO Term Finder. Figure 2 presents the hierarchical ranking of the GO Term Finder Process categories that were significantly enriched (p<0.05). These categories include filamentous growth, carbohydrate metabolism, response to chemical stimulus, response to stress, and transport; which were also represented in the top ten categories identified with GO Slim Mapper ( Table 3 , Figure 1 ). Figure 2. Hierarchical ranking of the GO Term Finder Process categories that were significantly enriched. Open in a new tab Only categories that are significantly enriched (p<0.05) are presented, except for those labeled grey added for hierarchical purposes. Subcategories with more than 2 higher rank categories that were not significantly enriched are not included in this figure (i.e., dicarboxylic acid transport and copper ion transport). For clarity purposes, categories with more than one connector are not presented, if the connecting category/categories was/were not significantly enriched. Color codes indicate p-values.Categories that were significantly enriched by spaceflight culture ( Figure 2 ) and are of particular interest for this study given their direct role in the infectious disease process are response to stress and filamentation. In addition, we were interested in differentially regulated genes involved in (i) biofilm formation, cell aggregation, and random budding given our phenotypic observations (described below), and (ii) response to drugs and RNA binding given previous findings from C. albicans and other microbial pathogens cultured in spaceflight and/or spaceflight-analogue culture systems [11], [12], [35]. These specific categories are analyzed in greater detail below. While these categories were initially identified using the set criteria of significance (p<0.05, fold-change >2), the number of genes belonging to pathways within these specific targeted categories of interest was enlarged using less stringent criteria (p<0.07 or fold-change >1.5, indicated with †). To validate the microarray data, qRT-PCR analysis of a targeted selection of genes that were differentially regulated with microarray was performed. Expression of the target genes (ALS1, CAP1, ERG6, YTH1, HSP31, GPX2) was normalized using the averaged expression of four housekeeping genes (ACT1, PMA1, RIP, RPP2B) [52]. All analyzed genes were found differentially regulated with qRT-PCR in the same direction as found with microarray analysis, and for four out of six analyzed genes, the differential regulation was significant (p<0.05 or p<0.01) ( Table 4 ).

Genes involved in biofilm formation/filamentation that were differentially expressed in spaceflight conditions include TUP1 (†), ALS1, CPH1 (†), AOX2 (†), and ORF19.4653. The latter gene was upregulated 7.5-fold in spaceflight, and is one of the ten most induced genes in the microarray. Interestingly, expression of the yeast-specific gene Yeast Wall Protein 1 (YWP1) was significantly induced in spaceflight samples, which promotes the non-filamentous phenotype of C. albicans under conventional culture conditions [59]. Additional genes involved in C. albicans biofilm formation (as determined by the GO Slim Mapper) that were differentially regulated by spaceflight include BRG1, MCR1, RHR2, and SHA3 [50]. Additional spaceflight-induced genes involved in hyphal growth (as determined by the GO Slim Mapper) include FGR16, ARC40, RFX2, SHA3, SPT5, STE13, TCA5, VID27, and orf19.1617 [50]. Next, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in the production of biofilm-associated extracellular matrix proteins. The gene encoding the glucanosyltransferase Phr1 (†), involved in glucan modification [60] was significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. As indicated by light microscopy and flow cytometry (see below), spaceflight-grown C. albicans showed enhanced self-aggregation as compared to ground controls. Since the observed cell aggregation in spaceflight-grown C. albicans structurally resembles the well-characterized flocculation phenotype of S. cerevisiae, we investigated whether genes involved in flocculation were differentially expressed. The cell surface glycoprotein Als1, which is both involved in self-aggregation of C. albicans and has both structural and functional similarity to the main flocculation protein Flo11 in S. cerevisiae [61], [62], was induced in spaceflight conditions. In addition, a gene encoding a protein similar to cell surface flocculin (HYR10) (†) was induced in spaceflight cultures. Genes involved in the three main flocculation regulatory pathways (based on the well-characterized S. cerevisiae) were found to be differentially regulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. For MAPK-dependent filamentous growth, these genes were TPK1 (†) (Ras-cAMP pathway), the ammonium permease Mep2, and the transcriptional regulator CPH1 (homolog of Ste12 in S. cerevisiae) (†). For the glucose repression pathway, these genes were HXT3 (†), HXT5, HGT1 and HGT2 (all hexose transporters).Stress and drug resistance A significant portion of genes within the stress/drug response categories were related to oxidative stress resistance. The gene encoding the oxidative stress response transcriptional regulator, Cap1, was significantly induced in response to spaceflight culture. Interestingly, more than 30% of the previously reported Cap1 regulon [63] was affected by culture of C. albicans under spaceflight conditions in this study. This includes genes under positive Cap1 control: TRX1, SOD1, PDR16 (†), IFR1, ARR3, orf19.7042, ARO9 (†), YIM1, RIB1 (†), orf19.1162 (†), ADH6, ESBP6, HGT2, orf19.6464 (†); and negative Cap1 control: MNN13, VMA10 (†), CHA2 (†). Among these 17 genes, 13 were expressed in the expected direction (i.e., TRX1, IFR1, ARR3, orf19.7042, ARO9, YIM1, RIB1, orf19.1162, ESPB6, HGT2, MNN13, VMA10, and CHA2). Additional spaceflight-induced genes identified in this study that have been reported to play a role in the oxidative stress response of C. albicans via Cap1 are GZF3 and orf19.2498 [50]. Other genes involved in the oxidative stress resistance of C. albicans that were induced in spaceflight include GPX1 and GPX2, which encode glutathione peroxidases; and SOD3, which encodes a superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, genes encoding the heat shock proteins Hsp10, Hsp30, Hsp31, Hsp60, Hsp78, Mdj1, Ssc1, orf19.9899 (putative heat shock protein), and Sti1 were significantly upregulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans cultures. In addition, spaceflight cultures of C. albicans showed significant upregulation of genes encoding ABC transporters and major facilitators, which are two main classes of drug transporters in C. albicans. These include CDR1 (†), CDR4, CDR12, HOL4, HOL2 (†), ORF19.4779, YOR1 (†), and orf19.10632 (possible ABC transporter). Spaceflight cultures also showed significant downregulation of the ergosterol-encoding genes ERG6 and ERG25 (reviewed in [64]), of which ERG6 has been shown previously to be important for amphotericin B resistance (a polyene) in C. glabatra [65], [66].Bud site selection and cytoskeleton Since we observed a higher abundance of random budding in C. albicans cultures exposed to spaceflight using SEM analysis (see below), we screened the microarray results for differential expression of genes involved in unipolar, axial, and random budding, as identified by Ni et al. for S. cerevisiae [67]. With the exception of the downregulation of ALG5 and BUD7, which are involved in unipolar and axial budding respectively, a significant number of differentially expressed genes following spaceflight culture were involved in random budding. These differentially expressed genes were classified in the categories of vesicular transport (downregulation of CLC1, VMA5 (†), VPS34 (†), VAC7 (†), END3 (†), LUV1 (†), VPS45 (†), SEC22), actin cytoskeleton (downregulation of SLA1 (†)), cell wall proteins (upregulation of GAS1), lipid metabolism (downregulation of FEN1 (†)), protein modification (downregulation of PMT2 (†), OST3; upregulation of MAP1), transcriptional proteins (upregulation of CTK1 (†) and TUP1 (†)), nuclear proteins (downregulation of TRF4 (†); upregulation of NPL3 (†), SFP1 (†)), and other proteins (downregulation of ATP14 (†) and ILM1 (†)). Interestingly, induction of the gene encoding the daughter-cell specific transcription factor Ace2 [68] was observed for spaceflight samples of C. albicans. Accordingly, downregulation of the gene encoding the G1 cyclin Cln3, which is under the negative control of Ace2, was observed [69]. Given the essential role of the actin cytoskeleton in random budding and previous findings that microgravity profoundly affects the mammalian cytoskeleton [70], we screened our microarray data for additional genes involved in the actin cytoskeletal organization [50]. We discovered significant downregulation of several key genes involved in actin polymerization and organization, including PFY1 (†), SLY1 (†), FAC1 (†), ACF2, AIP1 (†), AND SDA1 (†). Accordingly, differences in cell size and shape were observed when C. albicans was grown in spaceflight and ground conditions (see below).RNA-binding proteins A high percentage of differentially expressed genes in the GO Slim Mapper analysis were assigned to categories related to metabolism ( Table 3 ). We were particularly interested in genes assigned to ‘RNA metabolic processes’ (GO:0016070) based on the identification of the RNA binding protein Hfq as a global regulator of microgravity and/or microgravity-analogue culture induced responses in S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus [11], [20], [21]. The eukaryotic LSm proteins share structural and functional similarities with their prokaryotic counterpart, Hfq [71], [72]. The gene encoding LSm2 (†) was the only LSm family member observed to be differentially expressed in response to spaceflight culture under the conditions of this study. We considered the possibility that other RNA-binding proteins may be differentially expressed upon exposure to microgravity; therefore, the GO Slim Mapper ‘function’ category of RNA-binding proteins was investigated, which allowed us to identify 12 additional genes involved in RNA binding whose expression was significantly altered in response to microgravity culture, i.e., PRP39, SPT5, STI1, TCA5, YTH1, orf19.2610, orf19.265, orf19.3114, orf19.3547, orf19.4479, and orf19.6008. Interestingly, the genes encoding Yth1, Prp39, Spt5, Sti1, and Tca5 have been associated with hyphal formation [50].Morphological analyses Light microscopic analysis revealed enhanced cellular aggregation in flight samples as compared to synchronous ground controls ( Figure 3 ). While both flight and ground cultures showed cell clumping and occasional filamentation, cell cluster formation was more pronounced in flight samples of C. albicans. Based on microscopic imaging, spaceflight samples contained more cell clusters and their average size was larger compared to synchronous ground controls (1.7-fold, 10±3 cells per cluster for flight samples versus 6±1 cells per cluster for ground samples). In both test conditions, some cell clusters contained one filament ( Figure 4A , black arrow). Figure 4 shows 2500×, 5000× and 8000× SEM images of cell clusters from flight (A, B, C) and ground samples (a, b, c) respectively. Figure 3.

Open in a new tab Cell clusters of spaceflight (A, B) and ground control (a, b) conditions are shown. Black arrow points to filament, white arrows indicate aberrant cell shapes, grey arrows indicate normal bipolar budding, and white dotted arrows indicate random budding scars. Magnification = 5,000× for A and a, and 8,000× for B and b. C and c show images of spaceflight and ground control cells respectively at lower magnification (2,500×) to demonstrate the difference in space occupancy between the test conditions (3D architecture for spaceflight compared to flat structure for ground cultures). C. albicans ground samples exhibited a higher number of cells with a bipolar budding pattern (reflected by ongoing budding and budding scars), while more cells with multiple, randomly distributed budding scars were observed for spaceflight cultures ( Figure 4A and a, white dotted arrows). Accordingly, genes involved in random budding of C. albicans were significantly affected by spaceflight culture. Since the multiple budding phenotype could indicate the generation of more daughter cells that are typically smaller, the cell surface area, width and length were determined for C. albicans cells grown in ground or spaceflight conditions, respectively. The average surface area for ground samples (6.6±3.0 µm2) was significantly higher than for flight samples (4.6±2.4 µm2) (1.4-fold, p<10−9). In addition, Figure 5A shows that a higher percentage of cells with a smaller surface area was observed for spaceflight cultures. For example, 80% of the spaceflight cells versus only 47% of ground cells had a surface area smaller than 5 µm2 ( Figure 5A ). To assess cell shape, we determined the width-to-length ratio. Ground control cells had a higher percentage of cells with a ratio above 0.8 (67.8% for ground versus 30.5% for spaceflight), indicating that more C. albicans cells grown in control conditions had a rounder morphology ( Figure 5B ). It is important to note that ground control cells appeared more flat, compared to spaceflight cells, which showed a 3D organization ( Figure 4C versus 4c). This could potentially explain, at least in part, a larger surface area for ground control cultures. Also, the increased presence of aberrant yeast forms was observed in spaceflight samples ( Figure 4A and a, white arrow). The aberrant yeast forms in panels A and a are reminiscent of dying cells. However, post-flight viable cell counts indicated no differences between cultures exposed to microgravity and synchronous ground controls (i.e., 4.78×107 CFU/mL for flight samples and 5.94×107 CFU/mL for ground samples).

Results were obtained based on surface area and width-to-length determination of 143 ground control cells and 197 spaceflight-cultured cells.Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a 2.8-fold increase (p<0.025) in forward scatter signal for spaceflight-grown C. albicans ( Figure 6 ), which is reflective of the observed increases in cell aggregation in spaceflight samples. Figure 6. Flow cytometry analysis of C. albicans flight samples and ground controls. Open in a new tab Panel A represents a dot plot of C. albicans yeast cells grown at 30°C (to set the threshold for non-flocculated organisms). Panels B and C illustrate dot plots of ground and flight samples respectively. The Y-axis represents side-scatter and the X-axis forward scatter (FSC). Events with FSC values below the established threshold were considered single or budding yeast, whereas events above the established threshold were considered cell clusters.Virulence Due to limited sample availability, a focused study to determine the effect of spaceflight culture on C. albicans virulence was performed by infecting mice via the i.p. route with a single infection dose grown under spaceflight/ground control conditions and monitoring the time to death. This targeted study indicated no differences between the virulence of spaceflight and ground cultures, as reflected in comparable mouse survival in both test conditions (Figure S2).Discussion The presence of the opportunistic fungus C. albicans in the normal flora of astronauts could present an infectious disease risk during long-term missions. Indeed, microorganisms have been shown to enhance their virulence and/or display virulence-related phenotypes in response to culture in the low fluid-shear environment of both microgravity and microgravity-analogue culture systems [10]–[12], [20]–[22], [24], [34], [35], [73]–[79]. Moreover, as C. albicans causes a variety of mucosal and deep tissue infections in immunosuppressed patients [9], the decreased immune response of astronauts in-flight could further contribute to an increased susceptibility to microbial infections [1]. In addition to the application of spaceflight microbiology studies for infectious disease risk assessment in the astronaut population, these studies also entail applications to advance human health on Earth. Complementing conventional infectious disease research with spaceflight studies can serve to bridge gaps in our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions, given the unique ways in which both the host and pathogen respond to this extreme environment [1], [2], [24]. The low fluid-shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed during liquid culture in spaceflight and spaceflight analogues is relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their normal terrestrial lifecycles, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host [3], [42]–[45]. Thus, studying the responses of microbial cells to the microgravity environment of spaceflight holds potential for the discovery of novel infectious disease mechanisms that cannot be observed using conventional culture conditions, where the force of gravity can mask key cellular responses. This study demonstrated that spaceflight culturing induced a self-aggregative phenotype (resembling the flocculation phenotype of S. cerevisiae) in C. albicans and altered a plethora of genes involved in stress and drug resistance; which is important for the virulence of this organism. The high prevalence of differentially expressed genes involved in biofilm formation and filamentation of C. albicans in response to spaceflight culture suggests that the microscopically observed self-aggregative phenotype could be reflective of biofilms. Indeed, transcriptional regulation of biofilm formation and filamentation is intertwined in C. albicans, and an increased flocculation phenotype is believed to be the result of hyphae-specific gene expression [80]. C. albicans biofilm formation is divided into four distinct phases: (i) surface adhesion and colonization by yeast-form, spherical cells, (ii) microcolony formation on the attached surface by yeast-form cells, (iii) growth of pseudohyphae and hyphae in concert with synthesis of extracellular matrix, and (iv) dispersal of yeast-form cells to initiate biofilm formation off-site [53], . Microcolony formation on abiotic surfaces (structurally similar to flocculation) is estimated to take place 3–4 hours after initial adhesion, while formation of pseudohyphae and hyphae occurs at later time points (12–30 hours) [54]. We hypothesize that at the 25-hour time point of fixation in this study (for gene expression/microscopic analysis), C. albicans may have been in the process of transitioning to the hyphal biofilm stage, which was not yet translated at the phenotypic level. In support of this hypothesis is the previous finding that C. albicans grown in LSMMG conditions exerted increased biofilm formation and biofilm-associated filamentation after long-term culture in the RWV bioreactor (4–5 days) [35]. In microgravity-analogue conditions, biofilm formation was observed on the gas-permeable siliconized rubber membranes of RWV bioreactors, while in spaceflight samples, self-aggregation of microbial cells was observed. Interestingly, flocculation of S. cerevisiae has also been reported in LSMMG conditions, but detailed analysis of gene expression was not performed [32]. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus grown in LSMMG also displayed self-aggregative biofilm phenotypes [20], [73], and S. Typhimurium formed biofilms during spaceflight culture [11]. For C. albicans, key regulators of filamentation that were differentially regulated by long term culture in LSMMG (i.e., repression of YWP1, induction of HWP1 and BCR1) were not differentially expressed in shorter term spaceflight-grown C. albicans; although the gene encoding the cell surface glycoprotein Als1 showed significant induction in both spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures. Als1 is functionally and structurally similar to the major flocculation protein in S. cerevisiae, Flo11, and is an effector of filamentation, and a mediator of adherence and flocculation [62]. The transcriptional regulation of self-aggregation has extensively been studied in S. cerevisiae given the associated industrial applications of this phenotype. Three main pathways have been proposed to regulate flocculation (via Flo11) in S. cerevisiae: (i) Ras-cAMP, (ii) MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent filamentous growth, and (iii) main glucose repression pathway [82]. In this regard, genes involved in the three main flocculation regulatory pathways were also found differentially regulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. Therefore, Als1 could be a key mediator in the observed spaceflight-induced self-aggregative phenotype of C. albicans. We also examined the expression of genes involved in the production of biofilm extracellular matrix proteins. While the complete composition and transcriptional regulation of the extracellular matrix of C. albicans biofilms remains to be unveiled, studies have shown the presence of carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acid components [83]–[85]. A recent study identified three glucan modifying genes that play a role in glucan incorporation in the biofilm matrix [60], one of which, glucanosyltransferase (Phr1), was significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. Another morphological change that was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans was the presence of an increased number of cells with random budding scars as compared to more cells with a bipolar budding pattern for synchronous ground controls. This phenotype was also observed for S. cerevisiae exposed to spaceflight culture conditions [28]–[30]. Polarized cell division is essential for the development of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and typically takes place at the distal cell poles (180° from the birth site), termed bipolar budding, or at the proximal cell poles (adjacent to the preceding site of cytokinesis), termed axial budding [86], [87]. Bipolar budding is believed to maximize nutrient exposure of the growing yeast cells [86], while axial budding facilitates mating and diploid formation [88]. Specific mutations and environmental conditions cause random budding which is associated with loss of cell polarity, as reflected in a round cell morphology and cell separation deficiency, associated with production of cell clumps [87], [89]. As described above, enhanced cell clumping was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans. In agreement with the random budding phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight cultures, multiple genes involved in random budding of yeast were significantly affected. Interestingly, the enhanced presence of multiple budding scars could indicate the generation of more daughter cells in spaceflight conditions, which is supported by the smaller cell size of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans, and at the transcriptional level, by the induction of the daughter-cell specific transcription factor ACE2 and downregulation of the G1 cyclin CLN3 in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (see above) [68]. In yeast, asymmetric cell division results in the generation of smaller daughter cells as compared to the mother cell [90]. Since the regulation of the G1 cycle is, in part, dependent on cell size; daughter cells require additional growth before the Start transition in G1. This process is orchestrated by a cell size-sensing module, in which Cln3 is the main regulator [91]. The daughter-cell specific transcription factor, Ace2, has a direct negative regulatory effect on the expression of CLN3, which plays a role in delaying the G1 phase in daughter cells [69]. The enhanced presence of daughter cells could also indicate differential growth rate of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions. While at the time point of analysis, no differences in viable cell counts were recorded, more detailed monitoring of growth profiles are needed to determine if C. albicans altered its generation time in flight. It was hypothesized by Walther et al. that the random budding pattern in spaceflight cultures of S. cerevisiae could be explained by microgravity-induced changes in the cytoskeleton, which has been reported for a variety of mammalian cells (reviewed in [70]). Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton is essential for bud site selection, and mutants in actin organization exert a random budding phenotype [67]. In accordance with Walther and colleagues, we found that C. albicans exposed to spaceflight culture conditions downregulated several key genes involved in the actin organization and polymerization. Several mechanisms of drug resistance have been described for C. albicans yeast cells, including differential expression of drug targets, efflux pump-mediated drug transport, and utilization of compensatory and catabolic pathways [64], [95]. Biofilm formation confers additional resistance in C. albicans through increased cell density, production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the presence of persisters [64], [96]. In this study, genes encoding ABC transporters and multidrug efflux proteins (major facilitator family) were induced in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (such as CDR1, CDR4, CDR12), which are involved in resistance to different classes of antifungals including polyenes (e.g. amphotericin B) and azoles. Also, spaceflight cultures of C. albicans showed downregulation of genes encoding ergosterol (ERG6, ERG25), which is a major drug target for this organism. Ergosterol is uniquely present in the membranes of yeast and fungal cells, and polyenes specifically target ergosterol in the fungal membrane, which creates pores and results in cell death [95]. Downregulation of ergosterol levels in the cell membrane of sessile or biofilm-forming C. albicans contributes to the resistance of this organism to both polyene and azole antifungal agents. Interestingly, enhanced resistance of LSMMG-cultured C. albicans to amphotericin B was previously observed, which increased with the time of incubation under these microgravity-analogue conditions [35]. In addition, S. Typhimurium showed induction of outer membrane porins, ABC transporters, and other genes involved in antibiotic resistance in response to culture in spaceflight conditions [11]. Whether the observed differences in gene expression translate to a phenotype of C. albicans that is more resistant to antifungal drug agents remains to be determined. We observed that a significant number of genes differentially regulated in response to spaceflight culture were involved in the oxidative stress resistance of C. albicans. Cap1 presumably played a role in the oxidative stress-associated gene expression since it has been shown to be involved in the oxidative stress response of C. albicans [63], and more than 30% of the Cap1 regulon was affected by spaceflight. It would seem unlikely that increased gene expression related to oxidative stress resistance is due to the presence of increased oxygen levels since previously reported gene expression profiles of bacterial FPA cultures exposed to spaceflight indicated responses to microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions, presumably due to low fluid-shear levels and/or limited mixing in microgravity [10], [11], [79]. In correspondence with our data, the spaceflight-induced proteome of S. cerevisiae comprised multiple proteins involved in oxidative stress [30]. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that growth of S. cerevisiae in spaceflight in hyperoxic conditions resulted in extracellular release of glutathione [29]. The observed increase in glutathione release was suggested to have occurred through activation of ion channels in response to cytoskeletal rearrangements in microgravity culture conditions [29]. Spaceflight has been shown to modulate oxidative functions in other eukaryotic cell types, animal models, and astronauts [29], [97]–[102]. Collectively, our data indicate a potentially increased resistance of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans to antimicrobial agents and environmental stressors as compared to ground controls, which would need to be confirmed at the phenotypic level during future studies. Despite the induction of a virulence-related phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions, we did not observe significant differences in virulence, as determined using an i.p. mouse model of infection. This observation could potentially be explained by the route of infection, the use of only a single lethal dose of C. albicans for the inoculation, and the short-term exposure to spaceflight. Indeed, i.p. infection is not a standard infection method for C. albicans, and was chosen given the unique time constraints associated with the spaceflight experiment. Alternatively, it is possible that spaceflight culture does not impact the virulence of C. albicans. Additional studies are needed to conclusively determine if spaceflight alters C. albicans virulence. Since the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, was previously identified as a major regulator of the microgravity and/or microgravity-analogue response of S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus [21], we investigated the influence of spaceflight on expression of the LSm family of RNA-binding proteins in C. albicans, which are evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic homologues of Hfq [103]. The gene encoding the LSm2 protein was the only LSm family member that was significantly affected by spaceflight culture of C. albicans under the conditions of this study. LSm2 is part of (i) the cytoplasmic LSm1-7 complex, which is important for mRNA decapping and decay, and (ii) the nuclear LSm2-8 complex, which is important for pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing [104]–[107]. In response to stress, there is a rapid shift of LSm proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the LSm1-7 complex concentrates within granular foci called processing bodies (P-bodies) [104]–[108]. To our knowledge, the role of LSm2 in the transcriptional regulation, virulence and behavior of C. albicans is unknown. Whether LSm2 regulation is involved in the spaceflight response of C. albicans, supporting a conserved transcriptional regulation between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, needs to be assessed in follow-up studies. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the gene expression profile of a eukaryotic pathogen and could potentially induce a virulence-related phenotype, and represents an initial step towards the infectious disease risk assessment of C. albicans during spaceflight missions. The effect of longer-term microgravity cultivation on the biofilm formation, filamentation and virulence phenotype of C. albicans, together with investigation of the potential spaceflight-activated transcriptional regulator Cap1 identified in this study is of interest for future research. Moreover, this study further reinforces the role that physical forces in the human body, such as low fluid-shear, could play in the infection process; insights that hold promise to fundamentally advance our understanding of infectious disease on Earth.Supporting Information Figure S1 Schematic of fluid processing apparatus (FPA).

    "abstract": "Abstract This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a commensal fungus found throughout the human body in locations such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin [1,2]. Most infections are superficial, such as fungal nails, yet as an opportunistic pathogen, this yeast is capable of causing severe, life-threatening illness in immunocompromised hosts; therefore, it is a potential concern for crew during long term spaceflight [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the dichotomy between the commensal and pathogenic behaviors of C. albicans is complex and the molecular events responsible for converting a normally benign commensal into a highly pathogenic organism, which in systemic infections can produce 30–45% mortality, have not been fully elucidated [7,8,9,10,11]. Moreover, the therapeutic repertoire to treat systemic Candida infections is limited [12]. There are four classes of antifungal agents used clinically, including polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B), echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), azoles (e.g., fluconazole) and nucleoside analogs (e.g., flucytosine) [13]. Amphotericin B (AmB) was utilized as an early therapeutic for Candida infections and its derivatives remain among the most effective treatments for systemic disease [14,15,16]. For these reasons, AmB was chosen for analyses in the microgravity-associated susceptibility studies described herein. It has been proposed that AmB functions at the level of the cell membrane, where it interacts with the yeast-specific sterol, ergosterol, forming pores and compromising membrane integrity [13,15]. In contrast, caspofungin (CAS) was used to evaluate the yeast response to an antifungal agent harboring a mechanism of action distinct from that of AmB. Caspofungin compromises cell wall formation by inhibiting (1–3)-β-D-glucan synthase [11]. C. albicans is a dimorphic eukaryotic organism consisting of spherical yeast form cells and elongated filamentous cells and has been shown to respond to environmental stresses such as temperature, pH, and altered gas environments with physiological characteristics often associated with virulence [17,18,19,20]. Indeed the extreme environment of microgravity presents a unique challenge for organisms that have evolved under normal gravity. Microgravity may provide novel environmental stress cues leading to physiological adaptations or may allow insights into molecular pathways otherwise masked by a gravity-based environment, such as that described for the Pseudomonas Hfq pathway [21,22]. Among the potential adaptations of interest are those properties of C. albicans, on both the single and multicellular level, that enable it to infect an immunocompromised host. A well-studied phenotypic transition in C. albicans is filamentation, or hyphal/pseudohyphal formation, which can be induced by a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, pH, serum, elevated CO2 and hypoxia [23,24,25]. The combination of filamentous and yeast form cells can also form biofilms, or multicellular communities, contributing to increased virulence and enhanced resistance to environmental insults. As such, C. albicans, particularly in community form, has been documented to have increased resistance to antifungal agents [4,26,27]. In short, this yeast is capable of altering its phenotype in a number of ways to become better suited for infection and the environmental cues responsible for initiating these transitions are numerous. Hallmarks of an infectious form of C. albicans include robust growth, filamentation, biofilm production and resistance to antifungal agents. The studies included herein will focus on these yeast characteristics to determine whether microgravity represents an environmental cue with the potential to alter virulence. Due to limited access and the expense of spaceflight opportunities, ground-based simulators, such as rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines, have been used to generate a ‘modeled microgravity’ environment in order to predict the response of cells to spaceflight microgravity [28,29,30,31,32,33]. High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) are rotating-wall vessels that, by revolving about an axis perpendicular to the gravitational vector, create a state of functional weightlessness and minimal fluid shear within the chamber. Low-fluid shear may indeed be an important environmental signal for organisms cultivated in microgravity. Reduced convection and diminished bulk flow may resulted in an altered cell-associated microenvironment through depletion of nutritional components and accumulation of waste products [34]. Interestingly, when cultivated in analog bioreactors or in the true microgravity environment, many, but not all, organisms display morphological and genetic changes consistent with increased virulence and invasive behavior [22,31,35,36,37,38]. Previous studies of C. albicans cultured in HARV bioreactors demonstrated adaptations that included cells with increased filamentation, increased resistance to the antifungal agent AmB, altered colony morphology, and altered biofilm complexity [29,31]. The studies described herein focus on whether exposure of C. albicans to true microgravity induces similar adaptation responses to those observed in ground-based analog studies, especially as they relate to the potential for increased virulence. Embedded in these studies are comparisons between spaceflight experiments and between two separate flight hardware systems.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Yeast Strain and Growth Conditions C. albicans (SC5314, American Type Culture Collection) was maintained as a frozen stock at −80 °C. Routinely, and specifically the week before flight preparations, streak plates were initiated from frozen stock. As needed for experiment preparation, isolated colonies were used to initiate overnight planktonic cultures. For ground-based studies and flight sample preparation, all cells were cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for up to 18 h for planktonic cultures and inverted for 3 days for plated colonies, unless otherwise noted in specific methods. 2.2. Missions: Common Procedures Pre-flight sample preparation was done at Kennedy Space Center in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF). Freshly prepared yeast streak plates, and any specialized reagents or equipment, were shipped overnight to the SSPF laboratory. These reagents were shipped in replicate on consecutive days to minimize any complications of potential transport delays. The research team arrived approximately 10 days prior to launch, navigated the necessary badging and training requirements within the site-specific scheduling and availability, received the shipments of biologics, and began experimental preparations forthwith. Flight and terrestrial control samples, with a predetermined and condition-specific sample excess (spares), were prepared in bulk whenever possible. Following an incubation period, the bulk-prepared samples were inspection for contamination and other anomalies (bubbles, volume discrepancies, etc.), and removed from the population as necessary. From the remaining samples, flight and terrestrial control specimens were chosen and extra samples were deconstructed, cleaned, and sterilized should they be needed for reloading in the event of an extended launch delay. It should be noted that selection of flight and terrestrial control samples was essentially random other than verifying that flight hardware was imperfection free (no glass chips/cracks, no angled septa, etc.). Following launch, the terrestrial control samples were shipped overnight to the Montana-based laboratory at the appropriate temperature using phase change packaging as needed. Flight and terrestrial control experiments were conducted near synchronously; the offset time being determined before flight and allowing for communication of each procedure from the flight crew, to the Implementation Partner (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA), and then to the research team. Mission-specific timing is included in Table 1. In addition, Figure 1A,B synopsize the hardware utilized in each mission as well as the general contents and construction of the experimental samples. Specific experimental design details will be provided in the payload-specific sections below and are summarized in Figure 1C. To clarify the payload nomenclature, flight experiments are provided with an organizational name, in our case by NASA Space Biology as part of their funded microbial series of studies (Micro-x), and the payloads become broadly referred to by these names. The payloads (experiments) are manifested on a spaceflight mission once preflight requirements have been met and flight resources (space on a launch vehicle, crew time, International Space Station (ISS)- based resources) become available. Our first set of experiments is referred to as Micro-6, which was flown on Space X Cargo Resupply Service (CRS)-1, with a reflight referred to as Micro-8, flown on Space X CRS-4. The next set of experiments (Micro-14) was split between two missions so is further defined, for the benefit of clarity herein, by the hardware used, specifically the Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) and Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags. Micro-14/FPA was flown on Space X CRS-16 and Micro-14/FEP was flown on Space X CRS-17. The details of each payload/experiment are described in detail below. In each case, the C. albicans inoculum was prepared and stored in sterile water to maintain stasis. Experiments were initiated, or activated, by the addition of the inoculum to medium to stimulate growth. Following the defined growth period, experiments were terminated by the addition of fixative or by placing the samples at a restricted temperature (−95 °C or 4 °C, depending on the experiment). Upon completion of the mission and once the samples were received in the home laboratory, yeast were isolated from the hardware, which in many cases required deconstruction of the hardware components (de-integration), and processed as indicated for each of the specific outcome measures.

Open in a new tab Schematic representation of the hardware and experimental designs used in the mission payloads. (A) FPA bioreactors were used for the Micro-6/8 and Micro-14/FPA payloads and were loaded with two or three chambers, loaded in sequence, and separated by rubber septa. Medium was loaded in chamber A (2.7 mL in three chamber design, 5 mL in two chamber design) and cell inoculum was loaded in chamber B (0.5 mL). In the three chamber design, chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL of fixative or fresh medium. Chambers were sequentially mixed on a predetermined schedule by depressing a plunger, and consequently the column of reagents and septa, to allow mixing of reagents through the bypass in the glass barrel. All eight FPAs within a GAP were processed as a unit. At the conclusion of the experimental operations, the FPAs were stored within the GAP at the prescribed temperature. (B) FEP bags were used for the Micro-14/FEP payload, allowing for dilution (D1 and D2 bags) and serial subculture procedures. To activate growth, yeast (1 mL, 4 × 104 cells/mL) was injected into the first Large FEP bag (Bag A containing 11 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. At the end of this growth stage, an aliquot was removed and diluted 20-fold (Bag AD1). From this dilution, the next Large FEP bag was inoculated (0.25 mL into Bag B containing 11.8 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. This process was repeated until the cells had been cultured for five days (through Bag E). On each of the first four days, samples were also prepared to analyze antifungal sensitivity. For these samples, the dilution series was extended from the D1 dilution bag to the D2 dilution bag (1:10) and aliquots (0.2 mL) from D2 were used to inoculate Small FEP bags (A1–A12, B1–B12, etc.) containing antifungal agents or control medium (2.8 mL). Each day following the 24 h growth period and any necessary sampling, FEP bags (Large FEP bags A–E, dilution D1 bags A–D, and Small FEP antifungal bags) were frozen at <−80 °C for the remainder of the mission. (C) An overview is provided to summarize the experimental details for each payload. Cell inoculation, time of cultivation, relative time within the mission, and storage conditions are provided. In addition, the outcome measurements employed for each payload are indicated. Outcome measures that were performed/completed during flight with cells fixed in microgravity are indicated in black text. Outcome measures that were performed using cells returned viable (chilled or frozen) and processed post flight in the home laboratory are indicated in green text. 2.3. Mission-Specific Growth Conditions and Procedures 2.3.1. Micro-6 (and the Reflight Micro-8), Space X CRS-1 and -4, Respectively The hardware utilized for these payloads consisted of FPAs, organized eight per Group Activation Pack (GAP) (BioServe Space Technologies). See Figure 1A for a graphic representation of the FPA hardware and Figure 1C for an overview of the experimental design. Each FPA was divided into 2 or 3 chambers, indicated as chamber A, B and C, which were loaded sequentially and compartmentalized by rubber septa. Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL 1.2× YPD (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), containing the antifungal agent AmB (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) where indicated. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL C. albicans diluted in water (Low inoculum = 100 cells/mL, High inoculum = 1 × 105 cells/mL, and are referred to as Low and High, respectively). Chamber C contained 2.7 mL termination medium, consisting of either fixative (8.4% v/v paraformaldehyde, Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA, USA) or fresh medium (1x YPD for samples returned live). The GAPs were maintained at a cool temperature, specifically 4 °C pre-flight, ambient during launch, and 12 °C on the ISS, until the scheduled activation at 30 °C. Following the growth period (44 h for Low inoculum and 30 h for High inoculum), GAPs were chilled to 4 °C and maintained at that temperature through the remainder of the mission. There were two operational windows during the mission. Samples that were scheduled to be fixed were activated early in the mission (referred to as Early) to avoid any potential decreases in viability due to on-orbit storage. Conversely, cells that were scheduled to be returned live were activated as late as possible in the mission (referred to as Late) so as to retain viability following the growth period and during the transition back to Earth and the home laboratory. During transport back to Earth (splashdown in the Pacific Ocean) and then to the California-based handover location, samples were at ambient temperature (Micro-6) or 4 °C (Micro-8). Following payload handover to the Implementation Partner (BioServe Technologies) and research team, the samples were transitioned to storage on ice until they arrived at the home laboratory. Viable samples were isolated from the de-integrated hardware and processed the day of arrival. HOBO temperature sensors were included in representative GAPs to retrospectively analyze the temperature profiles and consistency between flight and terrestrial control samples (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Temperature tracings comparing the experience of flight and terrestrial control samples throughout the duration of the missions. HOBO temperature sensors were incorporated into selected GAPs and retrieved during hardware de-integration at the end of the mission. (A) Samples in the Micro-6 payload that were activated early in the SpX CRS-1 mission, (B) Samples in the Micro-8 payload that were activated and then terminated late in the SpX CRS-4 mission, and (C) Samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload that were activated and ‘terminated’ with fresh medium late in the SpX CRS-16 mission for return of viable cells. Temperature sensors were not associated with FEP bag bioreactors in SpX CRS-17. Terrestrial control operations were performed near synchronously (2 h delay from flight) and for the purpose of this illustration the time offset was removed from the tracings to allow overlap of transitions for better comparison. Flight temperatures are traced in black, terrestrial control temperatures are traced in green, and key operations are indicated in text and highlighted with red vertical lines.2.3.2. Micro-14/FPA, Space X CRS-16 Similar to Micro-6/8, the hardware utilized for this payload consisted of FPAs organized eight per GAP (BioServe Space Technologies). This experiment also had two operational windows. Some samples were cultured as described below early in flight (Early) and preserved either with the addition of paraformaldehyde or by freezing until the end of the mission. The remaining samples were maintained at 4 °C and cultured as late as possible in the mission (Late) and returned live and chilled (4 °C) for post flight analyses requiring cell growth. During each operational window, cells were cultured in microgravity for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. FPAs were prepared with 2 or 3 chambers as follows. (1) Samples to be frozen consisted of 2 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 5 mL of YPD (referred to as Low due to the lower cell concentration upon inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble to promote gas exchange. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). There was no chamber C. (2) Samples to be fixed consisted of 3 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL YPD (referred to as High as the cell concentration was higher at the time of inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). Chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL paraformaldehyde (10% v/v). (3) Samples to be returned viable consisted of 3 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL YPD (referred to as High as the cell concentration was higher at the time of inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). Chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL 1× YPD. Following completion of the mission, the live samples were isolated from de-integrated hardware and processed the day they arrived in the home laboratory; fixed and frozen samples were isolated shortly thereafter. Temperature sensors were included in representative GAPs to retrospectively analyze the operational transitions as well as consistency between flight and terrestrial control samples (Figure 2).2.3.3. Micro-14/FEP, Space X CRS-17 The FEP bag hardware was utilized for cultivating yeast in this payload and involved serial passage-style growth. The parent culture (Large FEP) was serially propagated over five days and from each of these populations a set of antifungal sensitivity cultures were initiated (Small FEP, see Figure 1B and details in Section 2.4.3. Large FEP bags for the parent cultures were filled with 1× YPD (11.0 mL for the initial culture, Bag A, and 11.8 mL for the four downstream cultures, Bags B-E) and gas bubbles were removed. The yeast inoculum of 1 mL (4 × 104 cells/mL in water) was loaded into a 3 cc syringe and sealed for transport. The needleless syringe was used to inoculate the initial culture (11 mL FEP bag, Bag A) on orbit. Following 24 h of growth at 30 °C, 0.5 mL of culture was removed from Bag A and diluted 20-fold in water (D1 FEP bags). An aliquot of this diluted sample (0.25 mL) was used to inoculate the next Large FEP bag (11.8 mL YPD, Bag B). This process was repeated such that the yeast was continually propagated through five cycles of 24 h growth (Bags C, D and E). The Large FEP bag samples were frozen (<−80 °C) either in the presence (Bag A and E) or absence (Bags B–D) of glycerol as a cryopreservation agent. As a complement to this series of growth, Small FEP bags containing 2.8 mL YPD and antifungal agents as indicated (AmB, 0.12–5 mg/L; and CAS, 0.01–0.1 mg/L) were inoculated with a dilution of the corresponding Large FEP culture. Specifically, the 20-fold dilution prepared from the large FEP bag as described above (D1) was further diluted 10-fold (D2 FEP bag) and aliquots (0.2 mL) were used to inoculate each Small FEP bag (A1–12 from FEP Bag A; B1–12 from FEP Bag B, etc.). These cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h and then frozen at <−80 °C for the duration of the mission. At the end of the mission, frozen samples were maintained at <−25 °C from undocking to the California-based handover location using phase change bags (Cold Stowage, NASA, Houston, TX, USA) and then to the home laboratory using dry ice. 2.4. Ground-Based Analyses 2.4.1. Cell Growth and Morphology Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% v/v, final) either in flight or immediately following hardware de-integration post flight. Direct manual cell counts were performed in duplicate using a Bright-Line hemocytometer (Sigma Aldrich) quantifying total cells as well as the contribution of cells with an extended morphology (filamentation; length greater than 2× the width of the cell) to the population. Samples were also stained with Calcofluor White (25 μM final, Molecular Probes) to stain chitin in the yeast cell wall and visualized using epifluorescence microscopy. Cell diameter and filament length were recorded using image collection on a Nikon Eclipse E-800 and interpreted using the software program Metamorph. Samples of non-fixed cultures were cultured post-flight on YPD agar plates as an indication of viability. Viability was calculated using colony forming units (CFU) with the actual/observed number of colonies compared to that expected based on cell counts. It is important to note that cell viability is likely to be higher than interpreted from the CFU analyses included in these studies due to the convention of our cell counting; budding cells are counted as two cells since that is how they will likely contribute to growth in planktonic cultures, whereas, these cells may remain associated during the plating process and give rise to a single colony. With this in mind, it should be understood that post-flight cell viability was quite high.2.4.2. Biofilm formation Previous studies demonstrated that C. albicans formed biofilm communities on the siliconized rubber membrane component of HARV bioreactors [31,39]. For this reason, small (5 mm2) samples of this membrane (Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) were included in chamber A of select FPAs in Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA. Samples were fixed during the mission and analyzed upon return. Upon hardware de-integration, the membrane coupons were placed into individual wells of a 24-well plate and stained with Crystal Violet (0.4% w/v in water, 1 mL per well, Sigma Aldrich) to stain cells and cell matrix components, adapted from previous methods [40]. Excess stain was aspirated, 1mL water was added to each well and mixed thoroughly. From each well, 100 μL was transferred to a 96-well plate to record optical density (referred to as ‘stain’). Excess water was removed from each well and discarded. A fresh aliquot of sterile water (1 mL) was added to each well, mixed, and a 100 μL sample was transferred to the 96-well plate (wash 1). Membranes were subjected to two more rounds of water washes and a final extraction with 1 mL of 10% v/v acetic acid (aa wash) to remove residual organic material, each involving transfer of a 100 μL aliquot to the 96-well plate (referred to as wash 2, wash 3, and aa wash, respectively). Stain levels were quantified on a microplate reader at 595 nm (iMark, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). 2.4.3. Antimicrobial Resistance The susceptibility of C. albicans to antifungal agents was determined by the ability of cells to grow in the presence of the indicated drug. Cells were either cultured in the presence of antifungal agents during the mission and preserved by fixation or freezing, or following the flight, live yeast was exposed to the antifungal agents immediately after recovery from the hardware. In the former case, the growth medium was supplemented with the antifungal agent in the hardware and maintained at 4 °C to retain drug efficacy into the mission timeline. Following the 24 h growth period, samples were fixed as indicated in the Mission-Specific details. Susceptibility was determined by direct cell count and the results were compared to samples without drug, as well as to the corresponding terrestrial controls. Alternatively, yeast cells were cultured in microgravity without treatment and returned live. Viable cells were recovered from the de-integrated hardware, counted, diluted to 1 × 105 cells/mL, and added (100 μL) in triplicate to wells of a 96-well plate pre-loaded with 100 μL control medium (2× YPD) or antifungal agent (2×) in YPD. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and 72 h and cell growth was quantified by optical density at 595 nm (iMark, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The drug concentrations chosen to assess AmB and CAS sensitivity were identified in the literature and refined empirically based on dose sensitivity assays performed with the Candida isolate used in the laboratory (unpublished data and [31,41,42,43,44]).2.4.4. Statistical Analysis For all data sets, means +/− standard deviations are shown. Determination of the difference between mean values for each data set was assessed by Student t-test. Significance testing comparisons are described in the associated figure legends and are routinely provided as flight compared to terrestrial controls, antifungal agent to control, or between hardware types. Significance was established at p values <0.05, with more specific p values provided in the corresponding figure legends.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Mission Timelines Although each mission has different timing, the specifics of which change in real time based on the actual launch date and accompanying mission scenario, Table 1 summarizes our general experiences for each payload. Categories in this table were chosen to provide perspective and demonstrate the temporal opportunities and constraints in which experiments are conducted. Understanding the launch cancelation (scrub) and subsequent launch scenarios (Scrub delay and Launch date) establishes the prelaunch experiment planning and preparation, especially as they relate to sensitive reagents and cells that have longevity and storage considerations. Launch to dock (arrival at the ISS) and Dock to sample access represent times during which samples are largely inaccessible for processing, although temperature requirements can often be maintained even with non-powered payloads. The lapse of time between when the vehicle docks and when the crew accesses specific samples may be important for an experiment, but occurs during a busy time of the mission. As such the timing for sample transfer to on-orbit power-controlled environments or early initiation of experimental procedures are negotiable, but ultimately needs to fit within the crew schedule, competing requests, and mission priorities. The Length of mission illustrates the active duration of the on-orbit procedures during which experiments can be conducted, including the shoulder days necessary for vehicle unpacking (beginning of the mission) and packing (end of the mission), during which crew time may be limited. Of note, samples often need to be equilibrated to a particular storage/post-mission temperature for travel once the experimental procedures are complete. One-to-two days is typically allowed for this temperature transition before packing the samples into the return vehicle (Experiment completion to undock). Finally, from the time the vehicle splashes down to when the samples arrive at the home laboratory, Splashdown to home lab, is relevant for sample processing considerations. These timelines will vary based on the splashdown location, travel time to shore, requirements of the science, and individual opportunities. In total, the timeline data is presented to provide some perspective as to how to prepare for and maximize the success of a spaceflight experiment using the ISS. 3.2. Sample Temperature Transitions throughout Mission Our first flight experiment was transported to the ISS on SpX CRS-1, so we were eager to obtain as much tracking information as possible, especially since there was no historical data on which to depend. In order to evaluate whether samples were exposed to the expected temperatures and to compare ambient temperatures within the ISS to those of the terrestrial setting of our laboratory, HOBO temperature sensors were included in selected GAPs. Figure 2 provides representative temperature tracings for flight and corresponding terrestrial controls for the duration of the indicated mission. Examples from SpX CRS-1 (Figure 2A), -4 (Figure 2B) and -16 (Figure 2C) are included. SpX CRS-17 utilized FEP bags and thus did not accommodate an accompanying temperature sensor. As illustrated in each panel, the active aspects of the experimental procedures were well aligned between the flight (black lines) and terrestrial controls (green lines) in terms of time and temperature (see activation and termination indicators on tracings, labeled and indicated by red vertical lines). The time offset (usually 2 h) between flight and terrestrial experimental procedures, which is necessary to verify on-orbit procedures by the crew, was removed to improve the temperature comparisons between conditions. Although the mid-mission storage temperatures varied slightly, with terrestrial controls elevated 1–2 °C relative to flight in SpX CRS-1 (Figure 2A) and reduced by approximately 7 °C in SpX CRS-16 (Figure 2C), the sample quality was likely to be minimally affected because the temperature variance was during stasis or after the operational window of the experiment. Of concern though, was the elevated temperatures of the SpX CRS-1 flight samples following undocking (approaching 25 °C) since the elevated temperature would promote post-microgravity growth of samples being returned live. Other than that specific situation, the temperatures of terrestrial samples were well-aligned with flight samples and the temperature targets were well approximated. 3.3. Yeast Growth At the time the initial studies were designed and initiated in 2011, one priority was to determine whether microgravity influenced overall cell growth. Although a simple outcome measure, growth was an important consideration for yeast as a potential infectious risk in spaceflight, but also provided insight into yeast adaptation to the microgravity environment. Embedded within the growth studies was a plan to allow the yeast to grow in microgravity for as long as possible, in spite of the requirement for a sealed growth chamber to ensure crew safety in the presence of an opportunistic pathogen. As such, the FPA bioreactors were prepared with two concentrations of yeast; a high inoculum (High, 1 × 105 cells/mL) to ensure growth, and a low inoculum (Low, 100 cells/mL) to allow maximum replicative potential before stationary phase was reached. The protocol was also designed such that yeast growth was activated early (Early) in the mission to minimize any potential storage stress on the cells while maintained in water-induced stasis. In addition, comparable samples were stored and activated late (Late) in the mission so that cells could also be returned live for post-mission analyses. This design also allowed some comparison between cells activated Early and Late in the mission to evaluate the effects of storage in the microgravity environment. As seen in Figure 3A, cell growth in most of the samples peaked at ~1 × 106 cells/mL, although the Low inoculum samples activated Early in the mission (Early Low) grew to a slightly higher density and demonstrated a minor advantage to cells grown in microgravity (Early Low, * p = 0.02). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Cell growth determination using direct cell counts at the end of each of the three missions. Cell growth was evaluated in the (A) Micro-6 (FPA), (B) Micro-14/FPA, and (C) Micro-14/FEP payloads. These analyses allowed mission-to-mission comparison using the same hardware (FPA comparison between A,B), as well as comparison using two different types of spaceflight hardware (A/B = FPAs versus C = FEP bags). ‘Low’ refers to the samples seeded with a low inoculum, ‘High’ refers to samples seeded with a high inoculum, ‘Early’ refers to samples activated near the beginning of the spaceflight mission, ‘Late’ refers to samples activated late in the spaceflight mission, and ‘viable’ refers to samples returned alive. Differential growth was not noted in the viable samples since flight cells were subjected to different transport temperatures than the terrestrial controls. Large FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 12 mL; small FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 3 mL. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p = 0.02; ** p = 0.01.It is worth noting that in Micro-6, cells that were scheduled to be returned live and stored at 4 °C actually experienced a 3-day transport temperature of nearly 25 °C (Figure 2). The cell growth data in Figure 3A for viable samples (‘Viable Low’ and ‘Viable High’) suggest that the cells indeed continued to grow. The higher level of growth in the flight samples as compared to terrestrial controls likely reflects the elevated temperature during transport. There was not a mechanism to track temperatures in real-time in order to subject terrestrial controls samples to conditions comparable to that experienced by the flight samples. Interestingly, the additional growth of the viable samples in both microgravity and terrestrial conditions indicates that the culture environment was capable of supporting at least 1–2 additional doublings, thus other factors must have been contributing to the apparent growth cap (1 × 106 cells/mL) observed in the other Micro-6 samples (Figure 3A). For clarity, the on-orbit growth period was sufficiently long for the Low inoculum samples to reach a density of 6 × 107 cells/mL and the High inoculum samples to reach a density of >1 × 108 cells/mL, using generation times established in ground-based studies. As seen in Table 2, generation times were calculated, factoring in the differences in inoculum size, and found to be similar between flight samples and the terrestrial controls. Interestingly, samples with the High cell inoculum had much longer generation times (300+ min/generation as compared to 150+ min/generation), suggesting the cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL was reached and the culture likely went into stationary phase. A kinetic analysis of cell growth was not performed due to resource constraints and safety precautions, so temporal aspects of the yeast growth dynamics cannot be concluded from these studies. Table 2. Generation time of yeast cells cultured in spaceflight and terrestrial control bioreactors. Sample Flight-Generation Time (min) Ground-Generation Time (min) FPA-Early Low (Micro-6) 155 159 FPA-Early High (Micro-6) 303 303 FPA-Late Low (Micro-6) 163 163 FPA-Late High (Micro-6) 300 310 FPA-Low (Micro-14/FPA) 113 129 FPA-High (Micro-14/FPA) 127 126 FEP-Large (Micro-14/FEP) 95 99 FEP-Small (Micro-14/FEP) 113 118 Open in a new tabIn the Micro-14 experiments, yeast grew to a 10-fold higher cell density than in the Micro-6 payload, even though they both used the FPA hardware (Table 2, Figure 3B). As indicated in Table 2, the generation times were similar among the Micro-14/FPAs, regardless of the initial cell concentration. Due to the similarity in growth characteristics of the Low and High inoculum samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload, the data were aggregated for Figure 3B. In this case, there is a trend toward an increased cell density of cells cultivated in microgravity. Finally, yeast cells grew most robustly when cultured in the FEP bag bioreactor (Table 2, Figure 3C) both in terms of shortest generation times and highest cell density. Indeed, the cell density observed in the FEP bags resembles that obtained with ground-based shaker cultures (2–3 × 108 cells/mL). For comparison, activation occurred at approximately 4100 cells/mL in the Large FEP bags (parent cultures for the serial cultivation) and approximately 33,300 cells/mL in the Small FEP bags (medium-only control bags from the antifungal drug study). These inoculations were the result of serial dilutions and inoculation done by flight crew (and corresponding ground crew), so cell concentrations are predicted. The cells within the Large FEP bags likely did not reach maximal density due to the length of the growth period, which in hindsight could have been extended another couple of hours. Data obtained from the small FEP bags in this payload indicates that C. albicans grows to a higher density in microgravity than in the terrestrial controls (** p = 0.01). Cumulatively, there was a trend in each of the payloads and in two types of hardware suggesting yeast grows to a higher cell density in microgravity than in terrestrial control conditions. 3.4. Biofilm Formation Biofilm formation is an important adaptation for cells facing environmental stress and our previous studies indicated that biofilm communities formed on the siliconized rubber membranes in HARV bioreactors [31]. As such, small coupons of this material were included in select FPAs in the Micro-6 and Micro-14 payloads to determine whether C. albicans would colonize the substrate de novo during short duration growth. During post-mission analyses, colonies could not be identified by microscopy in either experiment. The membrane coupons included in Micro-14/FPAs were fixed during flight and upon return they were subjected to a staining and washing procedure that is designed to identify cells, cellular debris, and/or cell-deposited matrix attached to the membrane substrate. From published studies, the more resistant the stain is to removal by washing, the tighter the association is between the stained material (cell community and components thereof) and the substrate [40]. Although a small and preliminary experiment, Figure 4 indicates that there does not seem to be an advantage for cells to form biofilms on the membrane coupons under the conditions in which they were grown. It is important to note that these were 24 h growth studies and it may take longer for the yeast to form cellular communities, especially if the substrate is not specifically inoculated. Indeed, the terrestrial control membranes appeared to be more apt to retain stained cellular components than in the flight samples, perhaps due to gravity-induced sedimentation (green line). In contrast, yeast was retained to a greater extent on the membrane coupons of cultures grown in hypoxic conditions in microgravity than comparable terrestrial controls (manuscript in preparation). Longer term studies, with cells under a variety of conditions, will be required to fully understand biofilm formation in the microgravity environment. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Passive seeding of biofilm communities on siliconized rubber membrane coupons. Siliconized rubber membrane coupons were included in the medium (chamber A) of selected FPAs in Micro-14/FPA and allowed to freely seed during the 24 h growth period of the experiment. Samples were fixed in microgravity and following sample return and hardware de-integration, the membranes were recovered and stained with Crystal Violet as an indicator of cells, cellular debris, and extracellular matrix. Stain that is retained on the membrane through a series of three water washing steps (wash 1, 2 and 3) and a final acetic acid wash (aa wash) is suggestive of a tighter integration of the cells with the substrate material. The stain removed by each wash was quantified by optical density at 595 nm. Black line = flight; green line = terrestrial control. 3.5. Cell Morphology and Filamentation The propensity of C. albicans to form filaments when confronted with environmental stresses, and the association of this morphology with increased virulence, led us to evaluate cell size and shape as first line analyses to determine whether and how the yeast adapt to a novel environment. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated differences in cell size, cell clumping, and filamentation of C. albicans cultivated in simulated or true microgravity [29,35,36,45]. Initial analyses of the Micro-6 payload suggested that more of the samples cultured in microgravity contained filamented cells than did the corresponding terrestrial control samples. A more thorough analysis of each payload found substantial variability, but did not support the hypothesis that microgravity stimulates a filamentous morphology (Figure 5A). Interestingly, although the overall level of filamented cells was low in each of the payloads, cells cultured in FEP bags had a significantly lower level of filamented cells than those in FPAs, regardless of whether they were cultured in microgravity or on Earth (Figure 5A). Cell size was also variable, with large cells measuring over 7.5 μm and smaller cells measuring 3.1 μm, although the average size of yeast form cells was not significantly different between flight (4.8 μm) and terrestrial controls (4.6 μm). Filaments were observed within the populations, whether cultivated in microgravity or terrestrially, with some filaments reaching lengths of over 142 μm (Figure 5C). In contrast to previous studies [28,35], cell clumping was not observed. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Quantification of yeast filamentous cell morphology. Aliquots from each growth condition in the three payloads were fixed and retained at 4 °C for microscopic analyses. Some samples were fixed in microgravity, but for those samples returned frozen or viable, the aliquot was fixed immediately upon sample return to the home laboratory. (A) Filaments were quantified as a percentage of the total population. In this analysis, samples were aggregated by hardware, thus the FPA data represents samples cultured in YPD from the Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA payloads. Similarly, the FEP data represents the aggregate from samples cultured in YPD in Large FEP bags and Small FEP bags from the Micro-14/FEP payload. * p < 0.003 for FPA vs. FEP.

Characteristics of C. albicans Cultured Post Flight Many outcome measures can be obtained from experiments conducted to completion on the ISS, yet for reasons of feasibility (especially working with a potential pathogen), as well as sample access and efficient use of crew time, we were interested in determining whether samples could be cultured in microgravity, returned live, and assessed immediately upon return with ground-based procedures. As preliminary evidence from the data obtained on SpX CRS-1 and presented in Figure 3A, it was clear that yeast transitioned to 4 °C following the growth period in microgravity remained viable and were capable of continued growth. In those studies, viable samples from the Micro-6 payload were scheduled to be returned at 4 °C, but the unavailability of cold storage resulted in transition to ambient temperature, as illustrated in Figure 2A. The yeast continued to grow during transport as observed in Figure 3A (‘Viable Low’ and ‘Viable High’). In retrospect, it was determined that flight samples were maintained at approximately 5 °C higher than terrestrial controls for nearly three days, likely contributing to the relative higher growth observed in the flight samples. As a quantitative analysis of post-flight viability, yeast cells were plated to evaluate colony forming units (CFU) relative to that expected based on direct cell counts. As illustrated in Figure 6A, the colony forming potential, and thus cell viability, following the Micro-6 mission was similar between flight and terrestrial controls, regardless of inoculum concentration. Interestingly, when the same analysis was performed on samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload, with transport temperatures maintained at <6 °C, terrestrial controls had a rate of viability double that of samples cultured in microgravity (Figure 6B). CFU analysis was also performed on yeast that were cryopreserved (5% glycerol) during the Micro-14/FEP mission. As observed in Figure 6C, the viability of cryopreserved yeast following propagation in microgravity is comparable to that of terrestrial controls. Although cryopreservation is a well-documented mechanism to maintain viability, pre-flight ground-based studies indicated that C. albicans is surprisingly hardy when frozen in the absence of a cryopreservation agent. Non-flight associated, ground-based studies demonstrated that although there is a rapid reduction in viability of cells stored at −80 °C, 50% of cells survive when frozen for 50 days, and 30% survive frozen for 100 days when compared to cells stored for the same amount of time in 5% glycerol (unpublished data). Considering this resiliency, cells frozen in microgravity without cryopreservation in Micro-14/FEP (Small FEP bags) were plated to determine viability. Surprisingly, yeast cultured in microgravity were remarkably more susceptible to freeze damage in the absence of a cryopreservation agent than were the terrestrial controls (Figure 6D). Similarly, flight samples frozen without cryopreservation in Micro-14/FPA also had a 5.9- to 10-fold lower viability (as per CFU) than did the terrestrial samples (data not shown). The discrepancy of survival between flight and control samples observed in these studies is intriguing. Due to reduced convection, the samples in microgravity are likely to freeze at a slower rate than terrestrial controls, yet a slower rate of freezing is often associated with improved cell viability [46,47]. Thus, the freezing rate is not likely to explain the difference in survival between microgravity and terrestrial cells. Indeed, ground-based studies comparing fast and slow freezing rates did not result in differences in yeast viability (data not shown). In addition, since the cells in Figure 6D were frozen for the return trip to Earth, it seems unlikely that re-entry g-force would have much impact on cell viability. Cumulatively, the diminished post-flight survival of cells cultivated in microgravity and stored either chilled (Figure 6B) or frozen without cryopreservation (Figure 6D) may suggest cellular adaptations that compromise cell wall or plasma membrane integrity. Current studies are underway evaluating changes in ergosterol, the membrane-associated yeast lipid comparable to cholesterol, levels in microgravity. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Viability of yeast cells stored chilled or frozen. At the conclusion of the growth period during the mission, cells were chilled to 4 °C (A) Micro-6 and (B) Micro-14/FPA. Alternatively, cells were frozen at <−80 °C and transported to Earth at <−25 °C with (C) glycerol as a cryopreservation agent in Micro-14/FEP, Large FEP bags or (D) without glycerol in Micro-14/FEP, Small FEP bags. Following sample return and hardware de-integration, cells were immediately isolated, counted, diluted, and plated to quantify colony formation. Colonies were counted after 3 days of growth at 30 °C. Data is represented as the actual number of colonies relative to that expected based on cell counts. Panel A represents samples activated late in the mission (Late) with either the high inoculum (High) or low inoculum (Low), as previously described. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p < 0.03, ** p = 0.003, flight vs. terrestrial.In addition to quantifying colony numbers, macro-architecture of the colonies was also evaluated. We previously demonstrated that colonies initiated from cells cultured in analog conditions, specifically the ground-based HARV bioreactors, demonstrated a complex and relatively unique morphology referred to as highly irregular wrinkled (HIW) [31]. These colonies also consisted of a high percentage of filamentous cells. We were eager to evaluate whether similar macrostructure was produced from cells cultured in microgravity. As illustrated in Figure 7 (panels A–F), the predominating colony morphology was smooth with agar-invading spike-like projections and larger offshoots, referred to as ‘feet’ projections in the literature [48,49]. This colony structure did not vary between flight samples (Figure 7A,C,E) and corresponding terrestrial controls (Figure 7B,D,F) in the Micro 6 (Figure 7A,B) or Micro 14/FPA (Figure 7C–E) payloads. The observed morphology was not representative of the fully smooth structure commonly associated with terrestrial cultures of C. albicans [50] nor to the HIW colonies observed almost exclusively from cells cultured in the HARV (Figure 7H) [31]. The observed spikey morphology seems to be specific to cells cultured in FPAs, as those grown in the FEP bags (Figure 7G) were predominantly smooth, with some colonies harboring the more traditional ‘feet’ projections often attributed to elevated CO2 conditions [48,49]. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Colony morphology and size evaluated in yeast samples returned live. Following each mission, cells were isolated immediately following hardware de-integration, counted, diluted, and spread on YPD agar plates. Following 3 days of growth at 30 °C the plates were transferred to 4 °C pending analysis. (A–H) Individual colonies were imaged to evaluate colony architecture. (A,C,E,G) represent flight samples; (B,D,F) represent terrestrial controls; H represents the HIW colonies produced after cultivation in the ground-based HARV bioreactor. Specifically, colonies are associated with the following payloads (A,B) Micro-6; (C,D) Micro 14/FPA, view of top of colony; (E,F) Micro 14/FPA, view of bottom of colony; (G) Micro-14/FEP and (H) HIW colony from HARV bioreactor as a morphology reference. Scale bars in panels (A,B) = 2.25 mm, (C–F) = 1 mm, (G,H) = 2 mm. (I) The diameter was measured on each of 15 colonies per plate for each payload. An aggregate of the data from all payloads was pooled and indicated as ‘All’. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p < 0.001, flight vs. terrestrial.Whether cells produced colonies, and how many, was used to evaluate cell viability as previously described and demonstrated in Figure 6. In addition, the size (diameter in mm) of individual colonies was measured as an indirect indicator of cell health and vigor. The diameter was measured on an average of 15 isolated colonies when possible (there were not that many colonies produced from the non-cryopreserved cells from Micro-14/FEP, Figure 6D). As illustrated in Figure 7I, there was an overall trend for cells cultured in flight to give rise to slightly larger colonies. In conjunction with the yeast growth presented in Figure 3, this is another outcome measure that indicates cells may gain a growth advantage upon exposure to microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. In addition, the growth advantage appears to be retained for at least a few days following re-introduction to Earth’s gravity environment. Colonies derived from cells harvested from FPAs (Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA) were similar in size to those harvested from FEP bags (Micro-14/FEP) suggesting the hardware was not introducing differences in growth potential. 3.7. Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents As an opportunistic pathogen, the susceptibility of C. albicans to antifungal agents is an important consideration with regard to spaceflight crew safety. This becomes even more critical based on our previous findings that yeast cultured in analog bioreactors (HARV) have an increased resistance to AmB [31]. As such, the ability of C. albicans to grow in the presence of two antifungal agents (AmB and CAS) was evaluated both by treating cells during the mission while in microgravity, as well as on yeast returned live following the conclusion of the flight. The Micro-6 payload was specifically designed to evaluate yeast growth in the presence of AmB while in microgravity. Cell growth was activated by the addition of medium containing 0.12 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L AmB and the samples were fixed following the growth period. Upon conclusion of the mission cell counts were performed to indicate the susceptibility of C. albicans to the cytotoxic effects of the antifungal agent (Figure 8A). AmB susceptibility was also evaluated in cells returned viable and exposed to drug following the mission, using CFU as the viability indicator. Interestingly, the AmB susceptibility results from the Micro-6 payload were nearly identical, regardless of whether drug exposure was in microgravity (Figure 8A) or following post-flight cultivation (Figure 8B). Although both doses of AmB impacted yeast growth, flight cells were more resilient than terrestrial control cells in the presence of the highest dose of AmB (0.25 mg/L). The Micro-14/FEP payload was also designed to evaluate antifungal sensitivity in microgravity. Parent cultures were serially passaged as described in Methods. On two separate occasions during the serial growth (following day 1 and 3 for AmB or day 2 and 4 for CAS), a dilution of the Large FEP bag culture was used to inoculate Small FEP bags containing antifungal agents (see Figure 1 for experimental design details). On each of the four days of the analysis, yeast were also cultured in control medium and 0.25 mg/L AmB for a direct day-to-day comparison. There was not a notable day-to-day adaptation of yeast to the antifungal agents (data not shown); therefore, samples conducted on the two separate days were treated as replicates and grouped in the analyses described herein. Throughout these studies, there was a consistent trend for the cells cultured without drug to grow to a higher density in flight as compared to terrestrial controls, as demonstrated in Figure 3. In addition, and as illustrated in Figure 8C/D, cells grew to a higher density in all conditions of the FEP payload when compared to Micro-6 FPA samples. Cultures propagated in microgravity were consistently more resistant to AmB than comparable terrestrial controls (p < 0.006). As illustrated in Figure 8C, flight samples grew in the presence of AmB when compared to untreated flight samples (p < 0.05), whereas the growth of terrestrial samples was stagnated in the presence of the antifungal agent when compared to the untreated ground controls (p > 0.33). As such, cells cultured in microgravity were more resistant to all doses of AmB than were the corresponding terrestrial control cells (p < 0.002). In contrast, companion cultures in the Micro-14/FEP payload that were exposed to a functionally distinct antifungal agent, CAS, were susceptible to increasing concentrations of drug, (Figure 8D). When CAS-treated samples were compared to the corresponding control cultures (flight CAS vs. flight YPD; terrestrial CAS vs. terrestrial YPD), the lowest dose had very little impact on cell growth and the highest dose prevented nearly all growth. Only at the intermediate dose of CAS (0.025 mg/L) was there an apparent difference between the impact of the drug on cells cultivated in flight or terrestrially. When compared to the untreated samples, terrestrial controls were more resistant to CAS than the cells cultured in microgravity, although not to the level of significance. Consequently, the resistance to AmB does not appear to indicate a broad spectrum resistance to antifungal agents and thus, the resistance to AmB may help elucidate the molecular and cellular adaptations that are occurring in microgravity. Figure 8. Open in a new tab C. albicans susceptibility to antifungal agents. Micro-6 and Micro-14/FEP were designed to include analyses of the susceptibility of yeast to antifungal agents during cultivation in microgravity.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion As increasing numbers of people spend longer amounts of time in space, it is imperative to understand the physiological adaptations that humans may experience as well as the threats they may encounter. C. albicans is important in its own right as an opportunistic pathogen, but as a eukaryotic organism, it may also provide a simple system that affords insight into how more complex eukaryotes respond to the environment of microgravity. That said, a thorough and robust investigation of biological adaptation to microgravity is complicated for a variety of reasons. Importantly, microgravity cannot be replicated on Earth. Devices that have been developed as simulation bioreactors have not been fully evaluated to determine which aspects of microgravity they simulate, nor the reliability and predictive value they provide. Secondly, opportunities to conduct experiments in true microgravity provide challenges in terms of cost, opportunity, procedures, and outcome measures. Whether utilizing the ISS, suborbital platforms, or free-flyer independent payloads, the conditions, processes, and hardware tend to be unfamiliar and different from those used to establish the foundational studies on which the experimental concepts have been developed. Finally, payload numbers and size tend to be limited, thereby constraining replicate numbers, ability to repeat experiments, and the breadth of experimental variables that can be tested. As such, we feel very fortunate to have flown C. albicans on several missions, allowing for comparison of a subset of outcome measures, across flight opportunities, in different types of hardware, and with reference to results obtained in the HARV bioreactor as a simulation device. When planning flight experiments there are mission-dependent events that will frame the overall timing of experimental procedures and processes, and importantly, the health and wellness of biological samples. This is a feature rarely encountered in normal ground-based experiments and must be thoroughly considered when planning flight payloads. Based on our experience, the time during which samples must be self-sustaining and without active intervention has shortened, but still involves multiple days. This is evidenced in Table 1 when one considers the time from launch to early sample access. In SpX CRS-1, this time lapse was 149+ h (6+ days), whereas the shortest lapse was 60 h (2.5 days) during SpX CRS-17. An additional 30–48 h, at minimum, must be added to allow for pre-launch sample preparation, handover procedures, and time required for vehicle packing. Cumulatively and regardless of the experimental design, there is likely to be a multi-day period during which the samples must be stable without crew intervention. At the other end of the mission, sample return timelines may also be critical for some studies. One can expect a multi-day travel period from when the samples leave ISS until they are available for in-lab processing. Beyond the launch and landing time constraints, there is a fair amount of flexibility for sample processing during the mission. Overall mission length of the SpX CRS missions has been fairly consistent and range from 21–36 days, with an average of 28 days. Most experiments are likely to be conducted in a fraction of that time but they all need to be well choreographed, in terms of crew time and equipment availability, with the other research and priority activities being performed on the ISS. The combination of complex timing issues and the use of novel hardware and procedures requires significant planning and modeling beyond that usually employed for standard experiments. Although each of our payloads was largely developed independently, we embraced the opportunity to compare basic cellular characteristics of C. albicans cultivated in microgravity across multiple missions (see Table 3 for a summary). The characteristics chosen for comparison are primarily those associated with virulence, including growth, cell and colony morphology, and antifungal resistance. In each of the payloads, yeast grew to a higher density when cultivated in microgravity. Surprisingly, the calculated generation time increased as the inoculum level rose, likely due to samples reaching a maximal density sooner, only to reside in stationary phase through the remainder of the growth period. Only in the FEP bags was the planktonic, ground-based, and generally accepted doubling time of 90–120 minutes approximated [51]. These data are limited to end-point analyses since kinetic studies were not performed; therefore, the contributions of rate of growth versus length of time in stationary phase cannot be distinguished. A potential secondary effect of yeast growth is the impact that metabolic activity might have on the surrounding microenvironment, amplified in microgravity due to low fluid shear and lack of convection and bulk flow. Further studies are required to determine whether the differences in growth between flight and terrestrial controls may be explained by a cellular impact on the surrounding microenvironment, including changes in the concentration of nutrients and waste products [34,52]. In addition, C. albicans produces significant levels of metabolic gas, such that the pressure within bioreactor units is substantially increased. The impact of such increased pressure on cell behavior has yet to be analyzed. That said, an increased cell density of nearly 10-fold was observed in the FPA hardware of Micro-14/FPA when compared to the Micro-6 FPAs. Whether the gas bubble incorporated into the Micro-14 FPAs impacted access to oxygen or provided a headspace to buffer the buildup of pressure is unclear. It is also worth noting that the mid-mission storage times and temperatures varied among the payloads and may have contributed to viability and ultimately cell density. To inform the impacts of these variations, pre-flight, ground-based viability studies had been previously performed with yeast stored in water. Cells remain sufficiently viable during long term (~30 days) storage at ambient temperature, although viability was highest when stored at 12 °C and next highest at 4 °C (unpublished studies). From these results, it seems unlikely that the modest changes in storage temperature between flight and terrestrial samples contributed to the observed difference in cell density. These results also led to flexibility for the pre-growth storage temperature to simplify flight operations and alleviate the need for on-orbit temperature maintenance equipment, which is often in high demand.

Unlike many cells, C. albicans is fairly recalcitrant to temperature variations. As such, C. albicans also retains reasonable viability when frozen in the absence of a cryopreservation agent. Surprisingly, the data presented in Figure 6D demonstrates that the resilience is compromised in cells frozen during spaceflight when compared to similarly treated terrestrial controls. The difference in survival was observed in samples frozen in FEP bags (Micro-14/FEP) as well as FPAs (Micro-14/FPA; ~6-fold fewer colonies in flight than terrestrial controls), demonstrating this is a feature consistent across two types of hardware. We considered the difference in survival secondary to differences in the rate of freezing. Cells are likely to freeze more slowly in the low convection environment of space, but a slower rate is typically considered to be advantageous for cell viability [46]. It was also noted that cells subjected to spaceflight experience more post-undocking temperature transitions than the terrestrial controls. Mimicking these temperature transitions in ground-based studies resulted in a loss of cell viability, but not nearly to the extent of that observed in the studies described in Figure 6D. Membrane integrity is associated with freeze stress; therefore, we are considering adaptations to the microgravity environment that might influence membrane composition. In addition to cell growth and survival, we analyzed the multicellular characteristics of C. albicans. A complex colony structure (HIW) had been observed in simulation experiments using the HARV bioreactor; therefore, viable cells were plated upon conclusion of the spaceflight missions to determine whether this morphological transition was also triggered in true microgravity. As demonstrated in Figure 7, HIW colonies were not observed following 24 h of growth in microgravity. Interestingly, a minimum of 5 days in the HARV was required to produce the complex colony microarchitecture observed [31], yet those cells went through a daily subculture procedure which may have delayed adaptation to the low fluid shear environment. It did not seem unreasonable to consider that a shorter term exposure to true microgravity may trigger similar adaptation responses as observed in the extended HARV studies. Longer term spaceflight studies are currently underway to address whether this colony morphology transition simply requires longer exposure to the true microgravity environment. Although the analysis of colony morphology required cells to propagate for several days in post-mission gravity conditions, the HARV-induced HIW morphology had been quite stable. Re-adaptation to 1g and subsequent loss of complex colony morphology does not seem a likely explanation for the observed lack of complex morphology. Biofilm communities were also undetectable in these studies, again suggesting the timeline of cultivation (24 h) was not sufficient for the development of complex macrostructures. Complex colony morphologies of C. albicans are typically associated with an increase in filamented cells in the population [50]. Therefore, since complex macro-architectures were not observed in the studies herein, it is not surprising that cell filamentation was also found to be minimal. Interestingly, microarray studies published as part of the microgravity experiment conducted on STS-115 identified the upregulation of several genes associated with filamentous forms of the yeast, including ALS1, ALS4, YTH1, SPT5 and STI1. Other genes associated with filamentation were either downregulated or unchanged, namely ALS2, TEC1 and ALS2 [35]. Of particular interest, the expression of form-associated genes was consistent with the observed low level of filamentation, specifically the gene coding for hyphal wall protein (HWP1) was unchanged in flight samples (−1.09) and yeast wall protein (YWP1) was elevated in flight samples (2.1). Current and ongoing studies will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of differential gene expression as related to C. albicans cultivation in microgravity. One adaptation that has been fairly consistent among flight opportunities and in the HARV simulation experiments is an increased resistance of C. albcians to AmB (Figure 8 and [31]). In spaceflight, the level of resistance is greater when cells grow to higher densities (FEP bags), although minimal dose dependence was observed in these same studies. It appears as though aqueous solutions of AmB are less stable than CAS, which may contribute to the difference in dose dependency observed between the Micro-6 (10 days of 4 °C storage following medium preparation) and the Micro-14/FEP (17 days of storage following medium preparation) experiments, although this loss of function was not predicted by pre-flight testing. A preliminary explanation is that AmB lost some efficacy during storage, resulting in drug levels that kept the growth of terrestrial samples in check, but had a milder impact on cells already observed to grow to a higher density in microgravity. The yeast susceptibility to CAS indicates that antifungal resistance is not broad spectrum and the difference between CAS and AmB may provide clues as to the molecular pathways that accompany the adaptation processes to microgravity. Specifically, we are evaluating the role of ergosterol in the adaptation process as it is described as being a cellular target for AmB cell association and pore formation [53]. Cell and colony morphology can be used as indicators as to the composition of the local environment since environmental stresses often lead to morphological transformations, including filamentation and colony extrusions [17]. As observed in Figure 7, cells from this study produced colonies with a spikey (or foot projection)-style colony morphology often associated with cells exposed to environmental stresses, such as increased levels of CO2 [8,54]. These studies suggest that cells cultivated in microgravity may produce and then respond to a microenvironment enriched in CO2 and other waste products. Since both flight and terrestrial samples demonstrated the colony projections, it will be important to parse out the contributions of microgravity relative to the environment created within specific hardware. Indeed, whether different types of flight hardware modulate or mask the effects of microgravity is an important consideration in these and other spaceflight studies. There exists a limited, but useful inventory of spaceflight-compatible hardware within the industry, with more being developed continuously. Identifying features that are necessary for successful operations is important and potentially challenging. In the case of C. albicans, hardware choices were constrained by safety precautions related to potential virulence and by the metabolic gas production during growth. This gas production precluded the use of several hardware models because the integrity of individual compartments was routinely compromised by the internal pressure created by metabolic gas. Thus, hardware that provided significant replicative capacity was restricted (for example multi-well units could not withstand the internal pressures produced by the yeast gas production) and some in-flight analyses were deemed less likely to succeed (microscopy, optical density measurements) due to the presence of extensive bubble formation. Thus, hardware choices for microgravity experiments need to be well-vetted and compromises may need to be made in the name of safety and feasibility. It is in this context that the data herein must be interpreted. With limited numbers of replicates, and the corresponding distribution of values, it was encouraging to identify consistent trends in the data. As summarized in Table 3, cells grew to a higher density in microgravity and produce slightly larger colonies than did the terrestrial controls. There was also a consistent trend toward increased resistance to the antifungal agent, AmB. The yeast did not exhibit a filamentation response regardless of conditions, and the colony architecture was not different between samples cultivated in microgravity and the terrestrial controls. We noticed that when there were differences between flight and terrestrial controls, those differences were amplified when the cells grew to a higher density, especially in the FEP bag hardware. The complexity associated with spaceflight experiments and the challenges associated with them dictates the importance of determining whether, and to what extent, ground-based simulators can be predictive of cellular adaptation to the microgravity environment. As such, it is important for investigators to continue exploring biological systems in a variety of spaceflight hardware and to relate those studies to each other as well as ground-based simulators. Comprehensive analyses of these systems in space and on Earth will provide a guide for the predictability of ground-based models and a foundation for investigators to evaluate flight hardware.",

Copyright notice ID: 8067245 PMID: 33801697 Abstract This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines. Keywords: microgravity, spaceflight, yeast, amphotericin B, caspofungin, antifungal, ISS, Space X, FPA, GAP, FEP bag1. Introduction Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a commensal fungus found throughout the human body in locations such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin [1,2]. Most infections are superficial, such as fungal nails, yet as an opportunistic pathogen, this yeast is capable of causing severe, life-threatening illness in immunocompromised hosts; therefore, it is a potential concern for crew during long term spaceflight [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the dichotomy between the commensal and pathogenic behaviors of C. albicans is complex and the molecular events responsible for converting a normally benign commensal into a highly pathogenic organism, which in systemic infections can produce 30–45% mortality, have not been fully elucidated [7,8,9,10,11]. Moreover, the therapeutic repertoire to treat systemic Candida infections is limited [12]. There are four classes of antifungal agents used clinically, including polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B), echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), azoles (e.g., fluconazole) and nucleoside analogs (e.g., flucytosine) [13]. Amphotericin B (AmB) was utilized as an early therapeutic for Candida infections and its derivatives remain among the most effective treatments for systemic disease [14,15,16]. For these reasons, AmB was chosen for analyses in the microgravity-associated susceptibility studies described herein. It has been proposed that AmB functions at the level of the cell membrane, where it interacts with the yeast-specific sterol, ergosterol, forming pores and compromising membrane integrity [13,15]. In contrast, caspofungin (CAS) was used to evaluate the yeast response to an antifungal agent harboring a mechanism of action distinct from that of AmB. Caspofungin compromises cell wall formation by inhibiting (1–3)-β-D-glucan synthase [11]. C. albicans is a dimorphic eukaryotic organism consisting of spherical yeast form cells and elongated filamentous cells and has been shown to respond to environmental stresses such as temperature, pH, and altered gas environments with physiological characteristics often associated with virulence [17,18,19,20]. Indeed the extreme environment of microgravity presents a unique challenge for organisms that have evolved under normal gravity. Microgravity may provide novel environmental stress cues leading to physiological adaptations or may allow insights into molecular pathways otherwise masked by a gravity-based environment, such as that described for the Pseudomonas Hfq pathway [21,22]. Among the potential adaptations of interest are those properties of C. albicans, on both the single and multicellular level, that enable it to infect an immunocompromised host. A well-studied phenotypic transition in C. albicans is filamentation, or hyphal/pseudohyphal formation, which can be induced by a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, pH, serum, elevated CO2 and hypoxia [23,24,25]. The combination of filamentous and yeast form cells can also form biofilms, or multicellular communities, contributing to increased virulence and enhanced resistance to environmental insults. As such, C. albicans, particularly in community form, has been documented to have increased resistance to antifungal agents [4,26,27]. In short, this yeast is capable of altering its phenotype in a number of ways to become better suited for infection and the environmental cues responsible for initiating these transitions are numerous. Hallmarks of an infectious form of C. albicans include robust growth, filamentation, biofilm production and resistance to antifungal agents. The studies included herein will focus on these yeast characteristics to determine whether microgravity represents an environmental cue with the potential to alter virulence. Due to limited access and the expense of spaceflight opportunities, ground-based simulators, such as rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines, have been used to generate a ‘modeled microgravity’ environment in order to predict the response of cells to spaceflight microgravity [28,29,30,31,32,33]. High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) are rotating-wall vessels that, by revolving about an axis perpendicular to the gravitational vector, create a state of functional weightlessness and minimal fluid shear within the chamber. Low-fluid shear may indeed be an important environmental signal for organisms cultivated in microgravity. Reduced convection and diminished bulk flow may resulted in an altered cell-associated microenvironment through depletion of nutritional components and accumulation of waste products [34]. Interestingly, when cultivated in analog bioreactors or in the true microgravity environment, many, but not all, organisms display morphological and genetic changes consistent with increased virulence and invasive behavior [22,31,35,36,37,38]. Previous studies of C. albicans cultured in HARV bioreactors demonstrated adaptations that included cells with increased filamentation, increased resistance to the antifungal agent AmB, altered colony morphology, and altered biofilm complexity [29,31]. The studies described herein focus on whether exposure of C. albicans to true microgravity induces similar adaptation responses to those observed in ground-based analog studies, especially as they relate to the potential for increased virulence. Embedded in these studies are comparisons between spaceflight experiments and between two separate flight hardware systems.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Yeast Strain and Growth Conditions C. albicans (SC5314, American Type Culture Collection) was maintained as a frozen stock at −80 °C. Routinely, and specifically the week before flight preparations, streak plates were initiated from frozen stock. As needed for experiment preparation, isolated colonies were used to initiate overnight planktonic cultures. For ground-based studies and flight sample preparation, all cells were cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for up to 18 h for planktonic cultures and inverted for 3 days for plated colonies, unless otherwise noted in specific methods. 2.2. Missions: Common Procedures Pre-flight sample preparation was done at Kennedy Space Center in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF). Freshly prepared yeast streak plates, and any specialized reagents or equipment, were shipped overnight to the SSPF laboratory. These reagents were shipped in replicate on consecutive days to minimize any complications of potential transport delays. The research team arrived approximately 10 days prior to launch, navigated the necessary badging and training requirements within the site-specific scheduling and availability, received the shipments of biologics, and began experimental preparations forthwith. Flight and terrestrial control samples, with a predetermined and condition-specific sample excess (spares), were prepared in bulk whenever possible. Following an incubation period, the bulk-prepared samples were inspection for contamination and other anomalies (bubbles, volume discrepancies, etc.), and removed from the population as necessary. From the remaining samples, flight and terrestrial control specimens were chosen and extra samples were deconstructed, cleaned, and sterilized should they be needed for reloading in the event of an extended launch delay. It should be noted that selection of flight and terrestrial control samples was essentially random other than verifying that flight hardware was imperfection free (no glass chips/cracks, no angled septa, etc.). Following launch, the terrestrial control samples were shipped overnight to the Montana-based laboratory at the appropriate temperature using phase change packaging as needed. Flight and terrestrial control experiments were conducted near synchronously; the offset time being determined before flight and allowing for communication of each procedure from the flight crew, to the Implementation Partner (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA), and then to the research team. Mission-specific timing is included in Table 1. In addition, Figure 1A,B synopsize the hardware utilized in each mission as well as the general contents and construction of the experimental samples. Specific experimental design details will be provided in the payload-specific sections below and are summarized in Figure 1C. To clarify the payload nomenclature, flight experiments are provided with an organizational name, in our case by NASA Space Biology as part of their funded microbial series of studies (Micro-x), and the payloads become broadly referred to by these names. The payloads (experiments) are manifested on a spaceflight mission once preflight requirements have been met and flight resources (space on a launch vehicle, crew time, International Space Station (ISS)- based resources) become available. Our first set of experiments is referred to as Micro-6, which was flown on Space X Cargo Resupply Service (CRS)-1, with a reflight referred to as Micro-8, flown on Space X CRS-4. The next set of experiments (Micro-14) was split between two missions so is further defined, for the benefit of clarity herein, by the hardware used, specifically the Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) and Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags. Micro-14/FPA was flown on Space X CRS-16 and Micro-14/FEP was flown on Space X CRS-17. The details of each payload/experiment are described in detail below. In each case, the C. albicans inoculum was prepared and stored in sterile water to maintain stasis. Experiments were initiated, or activated, by the addition of the inoculum to medium to stimulate growth. Following the defined growth period, experiments were terminated by the addition of fixative or by placing the samples at a restricted temperature (−95 °C or 4 °C, depending on the experiment). Upon completion of the mission and once the samples were received in the home laboratory, yeast were isolated from the hardware, which in many cases required deconstruction of the hardware components (de-integration), and processed as indicated for each of the specific outcome measures.

Open in a new tab Schematic representation of the hardware and experimental designs used in the mission payloads. (A) FPA bioreactors were used for the Micro-6/8 and Micro-14/FPA payloads and were loaded with two or three chambers, loaded in sequence, and separated by rubber septa. Medium was loaded in chamber A (2.7 mL in three chamber design, 5 mL in two chamber design) and cell inoculum was loaded in chamber B (0.5 mL). In the three chamber design, chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL of fixative or fresh medium. Chambers were sequentially mixed on a predetermined schedule by depressing a plunger, and consequently the column of reagents and septa, to allow mixing of reagents through the bypass in the glass barrel. All eight FPAs within a GAP were processed as a unit. At the conclusion of the experimental operations, the FPAs were stored within the GAP at the prescribed temperature. (B) FEP bags were used for the Micro-14/FEP payload, allowing for dilution (D1 and D2 bags) and serial subculture procedures. To activate growth, yeast (1 mL, 4 × 104 cells/mL) was injected into the first Large FEP bag (Bag A containing 11 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. At the end of this growth stage, an aliquot was removed and diluted 20-fold (Bag AD1). From this dilution, the next Large FEP bag was inoculated (0.25 mL into Bag B containing 11.8 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. This process was repeated until the cells had been cultured for five days (through Bag E). On each of the first four days, samples were also prepared to analyze antifungal sensitivity. For these samples, the dilution series was extended from the D1 dilution bag to the D2 dilution bag (1:10) and aliquots (0.2 mL) from D2 were used to inoculate Small FEP bags (A1–A12, B1–B12, etc.) containing antifungal agents or control medium (2.8 mL). Each day following the 24 h growth period and any necessary sampling, FEP bags (Large FEP bags A–E, dilution D1 bags A–D, and Small FEP antifungal bags) were frozen at <−80 °C for the remainder of the mission. (C) An overview is provided to summarize the experimental details for each payload. Cell inoculation, time of cultivation, relative time within the mission, and storage conditions are provided. In addition, the outcome measurements employed for each payload are indicated. Outcome measures that were performed/completed during flight with cells fixed in microgravity are indicated in black text. Outcome measures that were performed using cells returned viable (chilled or frozen) and processed post flight in the home laboratory are indicated in green text.2.3. Mission-Specific Growth Conditions and Procedures 2.3.1. Micro-6 (and the Reflight Micro-8), Space X CRS-1 and -4, Respectively The hardware utilized for these payloads consisted of FPAs, organized eight per Group Activation Pack (GAP) (BioServe Space Technologies). See Figure 1A for a graphic representation of the FPA hardware and Figure 1C for an overview of the experimental design. Each FPA was divided into 2 or 3 chambers, indicated as chamber A, B and C, which were loaded sequentially and compartmentalized by rubber septa. Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL 1.2× YPD (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), containing the antifungal agent AmB (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) where indicated. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL C. albicans diluted in water (Low inoculum = 100 cells/mL, High inoculum = 1 × 105 cells/mL, and are referred to as Low and High, respectively). Chamber C contained 2.7 mL termination medium, consisting of either fixative (8.4% v/v paraformaldehyde, Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA, USA) or fresh medium (1x YPD for samples returned live). The GAPs were maintained at a cool temperature, specifically 4 °C pre-flight, ambient during launch, and 12 °C on the ISS, until the scheduled activation at 30 °C. Following the growth period (44 h for Low inoculum and 30 h for High inoculum), GAPs were chilled to 4 °C and maintained at that temperature through the remainder of the mission. There were two operational windows during the mission. Samples that were scheduled to be fixed were activated early in the mission (referred to as Early) to avoid any potential decreases in viability due to on-orbit storage. Conversely, cells that were scheduled to be returned live were activated as late as possible in the mission (referred to as Late) so as to retain viability following the growth period and during the transition back to Earth and the home laboratory. During transport back to Earth (splashdown in the Pacific Ocean) and then to the California-based handover location, samples were at ambient temperature (Micro-6) or 4 °C (Micro-8). Following payload handover to the Implementation Partner (BioServe Technologies) and research team, the samples were transitioned to storage on ice until they arrived at the home laboratory. Viable samples were isolated from the de-integrated hardware and processed the day of arrival. HOBO temperature sensors were included in representative GAPs to retrospectively analyze the temperature profiles and consistency between flight and terrestrial control samples (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Temperature tracings comparing the experience of flight and terrestrial control samples throughout the duration of the missions. HOBO temperature sensors were incorporated into selected GAPs and retrieved during hardware de-integration at the end of the mission. (A) Samples in the Micro-6 payload that were activated early in the SpX CRS-1 mission, (B) Samples in the Micro-8 payload that were activated and then terminated late in the SpX CRS-4 mission, and (C) Samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload that were activated and ‘terminated’ with fresh medium late in the SpX CRS-16 mission for return of viable cells. Temperature sensors were not associated with FEP bag bioreactors in SpX CRS-17. Terrestrial control operations were performed near synchronously (2 h delay from flight) and for the purpose of this illustration the time offset was removed from the tracings to allow overlap of transitions for better comparison. Flight temperatures are traced in black, terrestrial control temperatures are traced in green, and key operations are indicated in text and highlighted with red vertical lines.2.3.2. Micro-14/FPA, Space X CRS-16 Similar to Micro-6/8, the hardware utilized for this payload consisted of FPAs organized eight per GAP (BioServe Space Technologies). This experiment also had two operational windows. Some samples were cultured as described below early in flight (Early) and preserved either with the addition of paraformaldehyde or by freezing until the end of the mission. The remaining samples were maintained at 4 °C and cultured as late as possible in the mission (Late) and returned live and chilled (4 °C) for post flight analyses requiring cell growth. During each operational window, cells were cultured in microgravity for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. FPAs were prepared with 2 or 3 chambers as follows. (1) Samples to be frozen consisted of 2 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 5 mL of YPD (referred to as Low due to the lower cell concentration upon inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble to promote gas exchange. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). There was no chamber C. (2) Samples to be fixed consisted of 3 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL YPD (referred to as High as the cell concentration was higher at the time of inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). Chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL paraformaldehyde (10% v/v). (3) Samples to be returned viable consisted of 3 chambers: Chamber A was loaded with 2.7 mL YPD (referred to as High as the cell concentration was higher at the time of inoculation) and overlaid with an air bubble. Chamber B was loaded with 0.5 mL of yeast suspended in water (4 × 104 cells/mL). Chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL 1× YPD. Following completion of the mission, the live samples were isolated from de-integrated hardware and processed the day they arrived in the home laboratory; fixed and frozen samples were isolated shortly thereafter. Temperature sensors were included in representative GAPs to retrospectively analyze the operational transitions as well as consistency between flight and terrestrial control samples (Figure 2).2.3.3. Micro-14/FEP, Space X CRS-17 The FEP bag hardware was utilized for cultivating yeast in this payload and involved serial passage-style growth. The parent culture (Large FEP) was serially propagated over five days and from each of these populations a set of antifungal sensitivity cultures were initiated (Small FEP, see Figure 1B and details in Section 2.4.3. Large FEP bags for the parent cultures were filled with 1× YPD (11.0 mL for the initial culture, Bag A, and 11.8 mL for the four downstream cultures, Bags B-E) and gas bubbles were removed. The yeast inoculum of 1 mL (4 × 104 cells/mL in water) was loaded into a 3 cc syringe and sealed for transport. The needleless syringe was used to inoculate the initial culture (11 mL FEP bag, Bag A) on orbit. Following 24 h of growth at 30 °C, 0.5 mL of culture was removed from Bag A and diluted 20-fold in water (D1 FEP bags). An aliquot of this diluted sample (0.25 mL) was used to inoculate the next Large FEP bag (11.8 mL YPD, Bag B). This process was repeated such that the yeast was continually propagated through five cycles of 24 h growth (Bags C, D and E). The Large FEP bag samples were frozen (<−80 °C) either in the presence (Bag A and E) or absence (Bags B–D) of glycerol as a cryopreservation agent. As a complement to this series of growth, Small FEP bags containing 2.8 mL YPD and antifungal agents as indicated (AmB, 0.12–5 mg/L; and CAS, 0.01–0.1 mg/L) were inoculated with a dilution of the corresponding Large FEP culture. Specifically, the 20-fold dilution prepared from the large FEP bag as described above (D1) was further diluted 10-fold (D2 FEP bag) and aliquots (0.2 mL) were used to inoculate each Small FEP bag (A1–12 from FEP Bag A; B1–12 from FEP Bag B, etc.). These cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h and then frozen at <−80 °C for the duration of the mission. At the end of the mission, frozen samples were maintained at <−25 °C from undocking to the California-based handover location using phase change bags (Cold Stowage, NASA, Houston, TX, USA) and then to the home laboratory using dry ice. 2.4. Ground-Based Analyses 2.4.1. Cell Growth and Morphology Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% v/v, final) either in flight or immediately following hardware de-integration post flight. Direct manual cell counts were performed in duplicate using a Bright-Line hemocytometer (Sigma Aldrich) quantifying total cells as well as the contribution of cells with an extended morphology (filamentation; length greater than 2× the width of the cell) to the population. Samples were also stained with Calcofluor White (25 μM final, Molecular Probes) to stain chitin in the yeast cell wall and visualized using epifluorescence microscopy. Cell diameter and filament length were recorded using image collection on a Nikon Eclipse E-800 and interpreted using the software program Metamorph. Samples of non-fixed cultures were cultured post-flight on YPD agar plates as an indication of viability. Viability was calculated using colony forming units (CFU) with the actual/observed number of colonies compared to that expected based on cell counts. It is important to note that cell viability is likely to be higher than interpreted from the CFU analyses included in these studies due to the convention of our cell counting; budding cells are counted as two cells since that is how they will likely contribute to growth in planktonic cultures, whereas, these cells may remain associated during the plating process and give rise to a single colony. With this in mind, it should be understood that post-flight cell viability was quite high.2.4.2. Biofilm formation Previous studies demonstrated that C. albicans formed biofilm communities on the siliconized rubber membrane component of HARV bioreactors [31,39]. For this reason, small (5 mm2) samples of this membrane (Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) were included in chamber A of select FPAs in Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA. Samples were fixed during the mission and analyzed upon return. Upon hardware de-integration, the membrane coupons were placed into individual wells of a 24-well plate and stained with Crystal Violet (0.4% w/v in water, 1 mL per well, Sigma Aldrich) to stain cells and cell matrix components, adapted from previous methods [40]. Excess stain was aspirated, 1mL water was added to each well and mixed thoroughly. From each well, 100 μL was transferred to a 96-well plate to record optical density (referred to as ‘stain’). Excess water was removed from each well and discarded. A fresh aliquot of sterile water (1 mL) was added to each well, mixed, and a 100 μL sample was transferred to the 96-well plate (wash 1). Membranes were subjected to two more rounds of water washes and a final extraction with 1 mL of 10% v/v acetic acid (aa wash) to remove residual organic material, each involving transfer of a 100 μL aliquot to the 96-well plate (referred to as wash 2, wash 3, and aa wash, respectively). Stain levels were quantified on a microplate reader at 595 nm (iMark, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). 2.4.3. Antimicrobial Resistance The susceptibility of C. albicans to antifungal agents was determined by the ability of cells to grow in the presence of the indicated drug. Cells were either cultured in the presence of antifungal agents during the mission and preserved by fixation or freezing, or following the flight, live yeast was exposed to the antifungal agents immediately after recovery from the hardware. In the former case, the growth medium was supplemented with the antifungal agent in the hardware and maintained at 4 °C to retain drug efficacy into the mission timeline. Following the 24 h growth period, samples were fixed as indicated in the Mission-Specific details. Susceptibility was determined by direct cell count and the results were compared to samples without drug, as well as to the corresponding terrestrial controls. Alternatively, yeast cells were cultured in microgravity without treatment and returned live. Viable cells were recovered from the de-integrated hardware, counted, diluted to 1 × 105 cells/mL, and added (100 μL) in triplicate to wells of a 96-well plate pre-loaded with 100 μL control medium (2× YPD) or antifungal agent (2×) in YPD. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h and 72 h and cell growth was quantified by optical density at 595 nm (iMark, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The drug concentrations chosen to assess AmB and CAS sensitivity were identified in the literature and refined empirically based on dose sensitivity assays performed with the Candida isolate used in the laboratory (unpublished data and [31,41,42,43,44]).2.4.4. Statistical Analysis For all data sets, means +/− standard deviations are shown. Determination of the difference between mean values for each data set was assessed by Student t-test. Significance testing comparisons are described in the associated figure legends and are routinely provided as flight compared to terrestrial controls, antifungal agent to control, or between hardware types. Significance was established at p values <0.05, with more specific p values provided in the corresponding figure legends. 3. Results 3.1. Mission Timelines Although each mission has different timing, the specifics of which change in real time based on the actual launch date and accompanying mission scenario, Table 1 summarizes our general experiences for each payload. Categories in this table were chosen to provide perspective and demonstrate the temporal opportunities and constraints in which experiments are conducted. Understanding the launch cancelation (scrub) and subsequent launch scenarios (Scrub delay and Launch date) establishes the prelaunch experiment planning and preparation, especially as they relate to sensitive reagents and cells that have longevity and storage considerations. Launch to dock (arrival at the ISS) and Dock to sample access represent times during which samples are largely inaccessible for processing, although temperature requirements can often be maintained even with non-powered payloads. The lapse of time between when the vehicle docks and when the crew accesses specific samples may be important for an experiment, but occurs during a busy time of the mission. As such the timing for sample transfer to on-orbit power-controlled environments or early initiation of experimental procedures are negotiable, but ultimately needs to fit within the crew schedule, competing requests, and mission priorities. The Length of mission illustrates the active duration of the on-orbit procedures during which experiments can be conducted, including the shoulder days necessary for vehicle unpacking (beginning of the mission) and packing (end of the mission), during which crew time may be limited. Of note, samples often need to be equilibrated to a particular storage/post-mission temperature for travel once the experimental procedures are complete. One-to-two days is typically allowed for this temperature transition before packing the samples into the return vehicle (Experiment completion to undock). Finally, from the time the vehicle splashes down to when the samples arrive at the home laboratory, Splashdown to home lab, is relevant for sample processing considerations. These timelines will vary based on the splashdown location, travel time to shore, requirements of the science, and individual opportunities. In total, the timeline data is presented to provide some perspective as to how to prepare for and maximize the success of a spaceflight experiment using the ISS.3.2. Sample Temperature Transitions throughout Mission Our first flight experiment was transported to the ISS on SpX CRS-1, so we were eager to obtain as much tracking information as possible, especially since there was no historical data on which to depend. In order to evaluate whether samples were exposed to the expected temperatures and to compare ambient temperatures within the ISS to those of the terrestrial setting of our laboratory, HOBO temperature sensors were included in selected GAPs. Figure 2 provides representative temperature tracings for flight and corresponding terrestrial controls for the duration of the indicated mission. Examples from SpX CRS-1 (Figure 2A), -4 (Figure 2B) and -16 (Figure 2C) are included. SpX CRS-17 utilized FEP bags and thus did not accommodate an accompanying temperature sensor. As illustrated in each panel, the active aspects of the experimental procedures were well aligned between the flight (black lines) and terrestrial controls (green lines) in terms of time and temperature (see activation and termination indicators on tracings, labeled and indicated by red vertical lines). The time offset (usually 2 h) between flight and terrestrial experimental procedures, which is necessary to verify on-orbit procedures by the crew, was removed to improve the temperature comparisons between conditions. Although the mid-mission storage temperatures varied slightly, with terrestrial controls elevated 1–2 °C relative to flight in SpX CRS-1 (Figure 2A) and reduced by approximately 7 °C in SpX CRS-16 (Figure 2C), the sample quality was likely to be minimally affected because the temperature variance was during stasis or after the operational window of the experiment. Of concern though, was the elevated temperatures of the SpX CRS-1 flight samples following undocking (approaching 25 °C) since the elevated temperature would promote post-microgravity growth of samples being returned live. Other than that specific situation, the temperatures of terrestrial samples were well-aligned with flight samples and the temperature targets were well approximated.3.3. Yeast Growth At the time the initial studies were designed and initiated in 2011, one priority was to determine whether microgravity influenced overall cell growth. Although a simple outcome measure, growth was an important consideration for yeast as a potential infectious risk in spaceflight, but also provided insight into yeast adaptation to the microgravity environment. Embedded within the growth studies was a plan to allow the yeast to grow in microgravity for as long as possible, in spite of the requirement for a sealed growth chamber to ensure crew safety in the presence of an opportunistic pathogen. As such, the FPA bioreactors were prepared with two concentrations of yeast; a high inoculum (High, 1 × 105 cells/mL) to ensure growth, and a low inoculum (Low, 100 cells/mL) to allow maximum replicative potential before stationary phase was reached. The protocol was also designed such that yeast growth was activated early (Early) in the mission to minimize any potential storage stress on the cells while maintained in water-induced stasis. In addition, comparable samples were stored and activated late (Late) in the mission so that cells could also be returned live for post-mission analyses. This design also allowed some comparison between cells activated Early and Late in the mission to evaluate the effects of storage in the microgravity environment. As seen in Figure 3A, cell growth in most of the samples peaked at ~1 × 106 cells/mL, although the Low inoculum samples activated Early in the mission (Early Low) grew to a slightly higher density and demonstrated a minor advantage to cells grown in microgravity (Early Low, * p = 0.02). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Cell growth determination using direct cell counts at the end of each of the three missions. Cell growth was evaluated in the (A) Micro-6 (FPA), (B) Micro-14/FPA, and (C) Micro-14/FEP payloads. These analyses allowed mission-to-mission comparison using the same hardware (FPA comparison between A,B), as well as comparison using two different types of spaceflight hardware (A/B = FPAs versus C = FEP bags). ‘Low’ refers to the samples seeded with a low inoculum, ‘High’ refers to samples seeded with a high inoculum, ‘Early’ refers to samples activated near the beginning of the spaceflight mission, ‘Late’ refers to samples activated late in the spaceflight mission, and ‘viable’ refers to samples returned alive. Differential growth was not noted in the viable samples since flight cells were subjected to different transport temperatures than the terrestrial controls. Large FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 12 mL; small FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 3 mL. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p = 0.02; ** p = 0.01.It is worth noting that in Micro-6, cells that were scheduled to be returned live and stored at 4 °C actually experienced a 3-day transport temperature of nearly 25 °C (Figure 2). The cell growth data in Figure 3A for viable samples (‘Viable Low’ and ‘Viable High’) suggest that the cells indeed continued to grow. The higher level of growth in the flight samples as compared to terrestrial controls likely reflects the elevated temperature during transport. There was not a mechanism to track temperatures in real-time in order to subject terrestrial controls samples to conditions comparable to that experienced by the flight samples. Interestingly, the additional growth of the viable samples in both microgravity and terrestrial conditions indicates that the culture environment was capable of supporting at least 1–2 additional doublings, thus other factors must have been contributing to the apparent growth cap (1 × 106 cells/mL) observed in the other Micro-6 samples (Figure 3A). For clarity, the on-orbit growth period was sufficiently long for the Low inoculum samples to reach a density of 6 × 107 cells/mL and the High inoculum samples to reach a density of >1 × 108 cells/mL, using generation times established in ground-based studies. As seen in Table 2, generation times were calculated, factoring in the differences in inoculum size, and found to be similar between flight samples and the terrestrial controls. Interestingly, samples with the High cell inoculum had much longer generation times (300+ min/generation as compared to 150+ min/generation), suggesting the cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL was reached and the culture likely went into stationary phase. A kinetic analysis of cell growth was not performed due to resource constraints and safety precautions, so temporal aspects of the yeast growth dynamics cannot be concluded from these studies. Table 2. Generation time of yeast cells cultured in spaceflight and terrestrial control bioreactors. Sample Flight-Generation Time (min) Ground-Generation Time (min) FPA-Early Low (Micro-6) 155 159 FPA-Early High (Micro-6) 303 303 FPA-Late Low (Micro-6) 163 163 FPA-Late High (Micro-6) 300 310 FPA-Low (Micro-14/FPA) 113 129 FPA-High (Micro-14/FPA) 127 126 FEP-Large (Micro-14/FEP) 95 99 FEP-Small (Micro-14/FEP) 113 118 Open in a new tabIn the Micro-14 experiments, yeast grew to a 10-fold higher cell density than in the Micro-6 payload, even though they both used the FPA hardware (Table 2, Figure 3B). As indicated in Table 2, the generation times were similar among the Micro-14/FPAs, regardless of the initial cell concentration. Due to the similarity in growth characteristics of the Low and High inoculum samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload, the data were aggregated for Figure 3B. In this case, there is a trend toward an increased cell density of cells cultivated in microgravity. Finally, yeast cells grew most robustly when cultured in the FEP bag bioreactor (Table 2, Figure 3C) both in terms of shortest generation times and highest cell density. Indeed, the cell density observed in the FEP bags resembles that obtained with ground-based shaker cultures (2–3 × 108 cells/mL). For comparison, activation occurred at approximately 4100 cells/mL in the Large FEP bags (parent cultures for the serial cultivation) and approximately 33,300 cells/mL in the Small FEP bags (medium-only control bags from the antifungal drug study). These inoculations were the result of serial dilutions and inoculation done by flight crew (and corresponding ground crew), so cell concentrations are predicted. The cells within the Large FEP bags likely did not reach maximal density due to the length of the growth period, which in hindsight could have been extended another couple of hours. Data obtained from the small FEP bags in this payload indicates that C. albicans grows to a higher density in microgravity than in the terrestrial controls (** p = 0.01). Cumulatively, there was a trend in each of the payloads and in two types of hardware suggesting yeast grows to a higher cell density in microgravity than in terrestrial control conditions. 3.4. Biofilm Formation Biofilm formation is an important adaptation for cells facing environmental stress and our previous studies indicated that biofilm communities formed on the siliconized rubber membranes in HARV bioreactors [31]. As such, small coupons of this material were included in select FPAs in the Micro-6 and Micro-14 payloads to determine whether C. albicans would colonize the substrate de novo during short duration growth. During post-mission analyses, colonies could not be identified by microscopy in either experiment. The membrane coupons included in Micro-14/FPAs were fixed during flight and upon return they were subjected to a staining and washing procedure that is designed to identify cells, cellular debris, and/or cell-deposited matrix attached to the membrane substrate. From published studies, the more resistant the stain is to removal by washing, the tighter the association is between the stained material (cell community and components thereof) and the substrate [40]. Although a small and preliminary experiment, Figure 4 indicates that there does not seem to be an advantage for cells to form biofilms on the membrane coupons under the conditions in which they were grown. It is important to note that these were 24 h growth studies and it may take longer for the yeast to form cellular communities, especially if the substrate is not specifically inoculated. Indeed, the terrestrial control membranes appeared to be more apt to retain stained cellular components than in the flight samples, perhaps due to gravity-induced sedimentation (green line). In contrast, yeast was retained to a greater extent on the membrane coupons of cultures grown in hypoxic conditions in microgravity than comparable terrestrial controls (manuscript in preparation). Longer term studies, with cells under a variety of conditions, will be required to fully understand biofilm formation in the microgravity environment. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Passive seeding of biofilm communities on siliconized rubber membrane coupons. Siliconized rubber membrane coupons were included in the medium (chamber A) of selected FPAs in Micro-14/FPA and allowed to freely seed during the 24 h growth period of the experiment. Samples were fixed in microgravity and following sample return and hardware de-integration, the membranes were recovered and stained with Crystal Violet as an indicator of cells, cellular debris, and extracellular matrix. Stain that is retained on the membrane through a series of three water washing steps (wash 1, 2 and 3) and a final acetic acid wash (aa wash) is suggestive of a tighter integration of the cells with the substrate material. The stain removed by each wash was quantified by optical density at 595 nm. Black line = flight; green line = terrestrial control.3.5. Cell Morphology and Filamentation The propensity of C. albicans to form filaments when confronted with environmental stresses, and the association of this morphology with increased virulence, led us to evaluate cell size and shape as first line analyses to determine whether and how the yeast adapt to a novel environment. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated differences in cell size, cell clumping, and filamentation of C. albicans cultivated in simulated or true microgravity [29,35,36,45]. Initial analyses of the Micro-6 payload suggested that more of the samples cultured in microgravity contained filamented cells than did the corresponding terrestrial control samples. A more thorough analysis of each payload found substantial variability, but did not support the hypothesis that microgravity stimulates a filamentous morphology (Figure 5A). Interestingly, although the overall level of filamented cells was low in each of the payloads, cells cultured in FEP bags had a significantly lower level of filamented cells than those in FPAs, regardless of whether they were cultured in microgravity or on Earth (Figure 5A). Cell size was also variable, with large cells measuring over 7.5 μm and smaller cells measuring 3.1 μm, although the average size of yeast form cells was not significantly different between flight (4.8 μm) and terrestrial controls (4.6 μm). Filaments were observed within the populations, whether cultivated in microgravity or terrestrially, with some filaments reaching lengths of over 142 μm (Figure 5C). In contrast to previous studies [28,35], cell clumping was not observed. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Quantification of yeast filamentous cell morphology. Aliquots from each growth condition in the three payloads were fixed and retained at 4 °C for microscopic analyses. Some samples were fixed in microgravity, but for those samples returned frozen or viable, the aliquot was fixed immediately upon sample return to the home laboratory. (A) Filaments were quantified as a percentage of the total population. In this analysis, samples were aggregated by hardware, thus the FPA data represents samples cultured in YPD from the Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA payloads. Similarly, the FEP data represents the aggregate from samples cultured in YPD in Large FEP bags and Small FEP bags from the Micro-14/FEP payload. * p < 0.003 for FPA vs. FEP.

The arrows highlight key features in each of the images, including, (B) a cell with a bud scar, as indicated by a cell surface region with higher intensity staining and a second cell with a caliper measurement of 5.1 μm, (C) a caliper measured filament (142 μm) in which higher intensity staining also indicates intercellular septa (arrow), (D) cells in the process of budding (arrow), and (E) long filamentous cell demarcated with narrowed septal junctions (top arrow), a cell budding from the filament (middle arrow), and increased staining at septal junctions (bottom arrow).3.6. Characteristics of C. albicans Cultured Post Flight Many outcome measures can be obtained from experiments conducted to completion on the ISS, yet for reasons of feasibility (especially working with a potential pathogen), as well as sample access and efficient use of crew time, we were interested in determining whether samples could be cultured in microgravity, returned live, and assessed immediately upon return with ground-based procedures. As preliminary evidence from the data obtained on SpX CRS-1 and presented in Figure 3A, it was clear that yeast transitioned to 4 °C following the growth period in microgravity remained viable and were capable of continued growth. In those studies, viable samples from the Micro-6 payload were scheduled to be returned at 4 °C, but the unavailability of cold storage resulted in transition to ambient temperature, as illustrated in Figure 2A. The yeast continued to grow during transport as observed in Figure 3A (‘Viable Low’ and ‘Viable High’). In retrospect, it was determined that flight samples were maintained at approximately 5 °C higher than terrestrial controls for nearly three days, likely contributing to the relative higher growth observed in the flight samples. As a quantitative analysis of post-flight viability, yeast cells were plated to evaluate colony forming units (CFU) relative to that expected based on direct cell counts. As illustrated in Figure 6A, the colony forming potential, and thus cell viability, following the Micro-6 mission was similar between flight and terrestrial controls, regardless of inoculum concentration. Interestingly, when the same analysis was performed on samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload, with transport temperatures maintained at <6 °C, terrestrial controls had a rate of viability double that of samples cultured in microgravity (Figure 6B). CFU analysis was also performed on yeast that were cryopreserved (5% glycerol) during the Micro-14/FEP mission. As observed in Figure 6C, the viability of cryopreserved yeast following propagation in microgravity is comparable to that of terrestrial controls. Although cryopreservation is a well-documented mechanism to maintain viability, pre-flight ground-based studies indicated that C. albicans is surprisingly hardy when frozen in the absence of a cryopreservation agent. Non-flight associated, ground-based studies demonstrated that although there is a rapid reduction in viability of cells stored at −80 °C, 50% of cells survive when frozen for 50 days, and 30% survive frozen for 100 days when compared to cells stored for the same amount of time in 5% glycerol (unpublished data). Considering this resiliency, cells frozen in microgravity without cryopreservation in Micro-14/FEP (Small FEP bags) were plated to determine viability. Surprisingly, yeast cultured in microgravity were remarkably more susceptible to freeze damage in the absence of a cryopreservation agent than were the terrestrial controls (Figure 6D). Similarly, flight samples frozen without cryopreservation in Micro-14/FPA also had a 5.9- to 10-fold lower viability (as per CFU) than did the terrestrial samples (data not shown). The discrepancy of survival between flight and control samples observed in these studies is intriguing. Due to reduced convection, the samples in microgravity are likely to freeze at a slower rate than terrestrial controls, yet a slower rate of freezing is often associated with improved cell viability [46,47]. Thus, the freezing rate is not likely to explain the difference in survival between microgravity and terrestrial cells. Indeed, ground-based studies comparing fast and slow freezing rates did not result in differences in yeast viability (data not shown). In addition, since the cells in Figure 6D were frozen for the return trip to Earth, it seems unlikely that re-entry g-force would have much impact on cell viability. Cumulatively, the diminished post-flight survival of cells cultivated in microgravity and stored either chilled (Figure 6B) or frozen without cryopreservation (Figure 6D) may suggest cellular adaptations that compromise cell wall or plasma membrane integrity. Current studies are underway evaluating changes in ergosterol, the membrane-associated yeast lipid comparable to cholesterol, levels in microgravity. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Viability of yeast cells stored chilled or frozen. At the conclusion of the growth period during the mission, cells were chilled to 4 °C (A) Micro-6 and (B) Micro-14/FPA. Alternatively, cells were frozen at <−80 °C and transported to Earth at <−25 °C with (C) glycerol as a cryopreservation agent in Micro-14/FEP, Large FEP bags or (D) without glycerol in Micro-14/FEP, Small FEP bags. Following sample return and hardware de-integration, cells were immediately isolated, counted, diluted, and plated to quantify colony formation. Colonies were counted after 3 days of growth at 30 °C. Data is represented as the actual number of colonies relative to that expected based on cell counts. Panel A represents samples activated late in the mission (Late) with either the high inoculum (High) or low inoculum (Low), as previously described. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p < 0.03, ** p = 0.003, flight vs. terrestrial.In addition to quantifying colony numbers, macro-architecture of the colonies was also evaluated. We previously demonstrated that colonies initiated from cells cultured in analog conditions, specifically the ground-based HARV bioreactors, demonstrated a complex and relatively unique morphology referred to as highly irregular wrinkled (HIW) [31]. These colonies also consisted of a high percentage of filamentous cells. We were eager to evaluate whether similar macrostructure was produced from cells cultured in microgravity. As illustrated in Figure 7 (panels A–F), the predominating colony morphology was smooth with agar-invading spike-like projections and larger offshoots, referred to as ‘feet’ projections in the literature [48,49]. This colony structure did not vary between flight samples (Figure 7A,C,E) and corresponding terrestrial controls (Figure 7B,D,F) in the Micro 6 (Figure 7A,B) or Micro 14/FPA (Figure 7C–E) payloads. The observed morphology was not representative of the fully smooth structure commonly associated with terrestrial cultures of C. albicans [50] nor to the HIW colonies observed almost exclusively from cells cultured in the HARV (Figure 7H) [31]. The observed spikey morphology seems to be specific to cells cultured in FPAs, as those grown in the FEP bags (Figure 7G) were predominantly smooth, with some colonies harboring the more traditional ‘feet’ projections often attributed to elevated CO2 conditions [48,49]. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Colony morphology and size evaluated in yeast samples returned live. Following each mission, cells were isolated immediately following hardware de-integration, counted, diluted, and spread on YPD agar plates. Following 3 days of growth at 30 °C the plates were transferred to 4 °C pending analysis. (A–H) Individual colonies were imaged to evaluate colony architecture. (A,C,E,G) represent flight samples; (B,D,F) represent terrestrial controls; H represents the HIW colonies produced after cultivation in the ground-based HARV bioreactor. Specifically, colonies are associated with the following payloads (A,B) Micro-6; (C,D) Micro 14/FPA, view of top of colony; (E,F) Micro 14/FPA, view of bottom of colony; (G) Micro-14/FEP and (H) HIW colony from HARV bioreactor as a morphology reference. Scale bars in panels (A,B) = 2.25 mm, (C–F) = 1 mm, (G,H) = 2 mm. (I) The diameter was measured on each of 15 colonies per plate for each payload. An aggregate of the data from all payloads was pooled and indicated as ‘All’. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. * p < 0.001, flight vs. terrestrial.Whether cells produced colonies, and how many, was used to evaluate cell viability as previously described and demonstrated in Figure 6. In addition, the size (diameter in mm) of individual colonies was measured as an indirect indicator of cell health and vigor. The diameter was measured on an average of 15 isolated colonies when possible (there were not that many colonies produced from the non-cryopreserved cells from Micro-14/FEP, Figure 6D). As illustrated in Figure 7I, there was an overall trend for cells cultured in flight to give rise to slightly larger colonies. In conjunction with the yeast growth presented in Figure 3, this is another outcome measure that indicates cells may gain a growth advantage upon exposure to microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. In addition, the growth advantage appears to be retained for at least a few days following re-introduction to Earth’s gravity environment. Colonies derived from cells harvested from FPAs (Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA) were similar in size to those harvested from FEP bags (Micro-14/FEP) suggesting the hardware was not introducing differences in growth potential.3.7. Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents As an opportunistic pathogen, the susceptibility of C. albicans to antifungal agents is an important consideration with regard to spaceflight crew safety. This becomes even more critical based on our previous findings that yeast cultured in analog bioreactors (HARV) have an increased resistance to AmB [31]. As such, the ability of C. albicans to grow in the presence of two antifungal agents (AmB and CAS) was evaluated both by treating cells during the mission while in microgravity, as well as on yeast returned live following the conclusion of the flight. The Micro-6 payload was specifically designed to evaluate yeast growth in the presence of AmB while in microgravity. Cell growth was activated by the addition of medium containing 0.12 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L AmB and the samples were fixed following the growth period. Upon conclusion of the mission cell counts were performed to indicate the susceptibility of C. albicans to the cytotoxic effects of the antifungal agent (Figure 8A). AmB susceptibility was also evaluated in cells returned viable and exposed to drug following the mission, using CFU as the viability indicator. Interestingly, the AmB susceptibility results from the Micro-6 payload were nearly identical, regardless of whether drug exposure was in microgravity (Figure 8A) or following post-flight cultivation (Figure 8B). Although both doses of AmB impacted yeast growth, flight cells were more resilient than terrestrial control cells in the presence of the highest dose of AmB (0.25 mg/L). The Micro-14/FEP payload was also designed to evaluate antifungal sensitivity in microgravity. Parent cultures were serially passaged as described in Methods. On two separate occasions during the serial growth (following day 1 and 3 for AmB or day 2 and 4 for CAS), a dilution of the Large FEP bag culture was used to inoculate Small FEP bags containing antifungal agents (see Figure 1 for experimental design details). On each of the four days of the analysis, yeast were also cultured in control medium and 0.25 mg/L AmB for a direct day-to-day comparison. There was not a notable day-to-day adaptation of yeast to the antifungal agents (data not shown); therefore, samples conducted on the two separate days were treated as replicates and grouped in the analyses described herein. Throughout these studies, there was a consistent trend for the cells cultured without drug to grow to a higher density in flight as compared to terrestrial controls, as demonstrated in Figure 3. In addition, and as illustrated in Figure 8C/D, cells grew to a higher density in all conditions of the FEP payload when compared to Micro-6 FPA samples. Cultures propagated in microgravity were consistently more resistant to AmB than comparable terrestrial controls (p < 0.006). As illustrated in Figure 8C, flight samples grew in the presence of AmB when compared to untreated flight samples (p < 0.05), whereas the growth of terrestrial samples was stagnated in the presence of the antifungal agent when compared to the untreated ground controls (p > 0.33). As such, cells cultured in microgravity were more resistant to all doses of AmB than were the corresponding terrestrial control cells (p < 0.002). In contrast, companion cultures in the Micro-14/FEP payload that were exposed to a functionally distinct antifungal agent, CAS, were susceptible to increasing concentrations of drug, (Figure 8D). When CAS-treated samples were compared to the corresponding control cultures (flight CAS vs. flight YPD; terrestrial CAS vs. terrestrial YPD), the lowest dose had very little impact on cell growth and the highest dose prevented nearly all growth. Only at the intermediate dose of CAS (0.025 mg/L) was there an apparent difference between the impact of the drug on cells cultivated in flight or terrestrially. When compared to the untreated samples, terrestrial controls were more resistant to CAS than the cells cultured in microgravity, although not to the level of significance. Consequently, the resistance to AmB does not appear to indicate a broad spectrum resistance to antifungal agents and thus, the resistance to AmB may help elucidate the molecular and cellular adaptations that are occurring in microgravity. Figure 8. Open in a new tab C. albicans susceptibility to antifungal agents. Micro-6 and Micro-14/FEP were designed to include analyses of the susceptibility of yeast to antifungal agents during cultivation in microgravity. Both payloads included amphotericin B (AmB) at concentrations previously determined to represent a functional range; the Micro-14/FEP payload also contained caspofungin (CAS) within a functional range. (A) Micro-6 samples were activated Early in the mission in the presence of 0.12 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L AmB and control conditions (YPD + DMSO), fixed at the end of the growth period, and cell counts performed upon return, (B) Untreated Micro-6 cells that were activated Late in the mission and returned viable were analyzed for antifungal sensitivity (AmB) at the conclusion of the mission using CFU analysis following drug exposure.

Discussion As increasing numbers of people spend longer amounts of time in space, it is imperative to understand the physiological adaptations that humans may experience as well as the threats they may encounter. C. albicans is important in its own right as an opportunistic pathogen, but as a eukaryotic organism, it may also provide a simple system that affords insight into how more complex eukaryotes respond to the environment of microgravity. That said, a thorough and robust investigation of biological adaptation to microgravity is complicated for a variety of reasons. Importantly, microgravity cannot be replicated on Earth. Devices that have been developed as simulation bioreactors have not been fully evaluated to determine which aspects of microgravity they simulate, nor the reliability and predictive value they provide. Secondly, opportunities to conduct experiments in true microgravity provide challenges in terms of cost, opportunity, procedures, and outcome measures. Whether utilizing the ISS, suborbital platforms, or free-flyer independent payloads, the conditions, processes, and hardware tend to be unfamiliar and different from those used to establish the foundational studies on which the experimental concepts have been developed. Finally, payload numbers and size tend to be limited, thereby constraining replicate numbers, ability to repeat experiments, and the breadth of experimental variables that can be tested. As such, we feel very fortunate to have flown C. albicans on several missions, allowing for comparison of a subset of outcome measures, across flight opportunities, in different types of hardware, and with reference to results obtained in the HARV bioreactor as a simulation device. When planning flight experiments there are mission-dependent events that will frame the overall timing of experimental procedures and processes, and importantly, the health and wellness of biological samples. This is a feature rarely encountered in normal ground-based experiments and must be thoroughly considered when planning flight payloads. Based on our experience, the time during which samples must be self-sustaining and without active intervention has shortened, but still involves multiple days. This is evidenced in Table 1 when one considers the time from launch to early sample access. In SpX CRS-1, this time lapse was 149+ h (6+ days), whereas the shortest lapse was 60 h (2.5 days) during SpX CRS-17. An additional 30–48 h, at minimum, must be added to allow for pre-launch sample preparation, handover procedures, and time required for vehicle packing. Cumulatively and regardless of the experimental design, there is likely to be a multi-day period during which the samples must be stable without crew intervention. At the other end of the mission, sample return timelines may also be critical for some studies. One can expect a multi-day travel period from when the samples leave ISS until they are available for in-lab processing. Beyond the launch and landing time constraints, there is a fair amount of flexibility for sample processing during the mission. Overall mission length of the SpX CRS missions has been fairly consistent and range from 21–36 days, with an average of 28 days. Most experiments are likely to be conducted in a fraction of that time but they all need to be well choreographed, in terms of crew time and equipment availability, with the other research and priority activities being performed on the ISS. The combination of complex timing issues and the use of novel hardware and procedures requires significant planning and modeling beyond that usually employed for standard experiments. Although each of our payloads was largely developed independently, we embraced the opportunity to compare basic cellular characteristics of C. albicans cultivated in microgravity across multiple missions (see Table 3 for a summary). The characteristics chosen for comparison are primarily those associated with virulence, including growth, cell and colony morphology, and antifungal resistance. In each of the payloads, yeast grew to a higher density when cultivated in microgravity. Surprisingly, the calculated generation time increased as the inoculum level rose, likely due to samples reaching a maximal density sooner, only to reside in stationary phase through the remainder of the growth period. Only in the FEP bags was the planktonic, ground-based, and generally accepted doubling time of 90–120 minutes approximated [51]. These data are limited to end-point analyses since kinetic studies were not performed; therefore, the contributions of rate of growth versus length of time in stationary phase cannot be distinguished. A potential secondary effect of yeast growth is the impact that metabolic activity might have on the surrounding microenvironment, amplified in microgravity due to low fluid shear and lack of convection and bulk flow. Further studies are required to determine whether the differences in growth between flight and terrestrial controls may be explained by a cellular impact on the surrounding microenvironment, including changes in the concentration of nutrients and waste products [34,52]. In addition, C. albicans produces significant levels of metabolic gas, such that the pressure within bioreactor units is substantially increased. The impact of such increased pressure on cell behavior has yet to be analyzed. That said, an increased cell density of nearly 10-fold was observed in the FPA hardware of Micro-14/FPA when compared to the Micro-6 FPAs. Whether the gas bubble incorporated into the Micro-14 FPAs impacted access to oxygen or provided a headspace to buffer the buildup of pressure is unclear. It is also worth noting that the mid-mission storage times and temperatures varied among the payloads and may have contributed to viability and ultimately cell density. To inform the impacts of these variations, pre-flight, ground-based viability studies had been previously performed with yeast stored in water. Cells remain sufficiently viable during long term (~30 days) storage at ambient temperature, although viability was highest when stored at 12 °C and next highest at 4 °C (unpublished studies). From these results, it seems unlikely that the modest changes in storage temperature between flight and terrestrial samples contributed to the observed difference in cell density. These results also led to flexibility for the pre-growth storage temperature to simplify flight operations and alleviate the need for on-orbit temperature maintenance equipment, which is often in high demand.

As such, C. albicans also retains reasonable viability when frozen in the absence of a cryopreservation agent. Surprisingly, the data presented in Figure 6D demonstrates that the resilience is compromised in cells frozen during spaceflight when compared to similarly treated terrestrial controls. The difference in survival was observed in samples frozen in FEP bags (Micro-14/FEP) as well as FPAs (Micro-14/FPA; ~6-fold fewer colonies in flight than terrestrial controls), demonstrating this is a feature consistent across two types of hardware. We considered the difference in survival secondary to differences in the rate of freezing. Cells are likely to freeze more slowly in the low convection environment of space, but a slower rate is typically considered to be advantageous for cell viability [46]. It was also noted that cells subjected to spaceflight experience more post-undocking temperature transitions than the terrestrial controls. Mimicking these temperature transitions in ground-based studies resulted in a loss of cell viability, but not nearly to the extent of that observed in the studies described in Figure 6D. Membrane integrity is associated with freeze stress; therefore, we are considering adaptations to the microgravity environment that might influence membrane composition. In addition to cell growth and survival, we analyzed the multicellular characteristics of C. albicans. A complex colony structure (HIW) had been observed in simulation experiments using the HARV bioreactor; therefore, viable cells were plated upon conclusion of the spaceflight missions to determine whether this morphological transition was also triggered in true microgravity. As demonstrated in Figure 7, HIW colonies were not observed following 24 h of growth in microgravity. Interestingly, a minimum of 5 days in the HARV was required to produce the complex colony microarchitecture observed [31], yet those cells went through a daily subculture procedure which may have delayed adaptation to the low fluid shear environment. It did not seem unreasonable to consider that a shorter term exposure to true microgravity may trigger similar adaptation responses as observed in the extended HARV studies. Longer term spaceflight studies are currently underway to address whether this colony morphology transition simply requires longer exposure to the true microgravity environment. Although the analysis of colony morphology required cells to propagate for several days in post-mission gravity conditions, the HARV-induced HIW morphology had been quite stable. Re-adaptation to 1g and subsequent loss of complex colony morphology does not seem a likely explanation for the observed lack of complex morphology. Biofilm communities were also undetectable in these studies, again suggesting the timeline of cultivation (24 h) was not sufficient for the development of complex macrostructures. Complex colony morphologies of C. albicans are typically associated with an increase in filamented cells in the population [50]. Therefore, since complex macro-architectures were not observed in the studies herein, it is not surprising that cell filamentation was also found to be minimal. Interestingly, microarray studies published as part of the microgravity experiment conducted on STS-115 identified the upregulation of several genes associated with filamentous forms of the yeast, including ALS1, ALS4, YTH1, SPT5 and STI1. Other genes associated with filamentation were either downregulated or unchanged, namely ALS2, TEC1 and ALS2 [35]. Of particular interest, the expression of form-associated genes was consistent with the observed low level of filamentation, specifically the gene coding for hyphal wall protein (HWP1) was unchanged in flight samples (−1.09) and yeast wall protein (YWP1) was elevated in flight samples (2.1). Current and ongoing studies will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of differential gene expression as related to C. albicans cultivation in microgravity. One adaptation that has been fairly consistent among flight opportunities and in the HARV simulation experiments is an increased resistance of C. albcians to AmB (Figure 8 and [31]). In spaceflight, the level of resistance is greater when cells grow to higher densities (FEP bags), although minimal dose dependence was observed in these same studies. It appears as though aqueous solutions of AmB are less stable than CAS, which may contribute to the difference in dose dependency observed between the Micro-6 (10 days of 4 °C storage following medium preparation) and the Micro-14/FEP (17 days of storage following medium preparation) experiments, although this loss of function was not predicted by pre-flight testing. A preliminary explanation is that AmB lost some efficacy during storage, resulting in drug levels that kept the growth of terrestrial samples in check, but had a milder impact on cells already observed to grow to a higher density in microgravity. The yeast susceptibility to CAS indicates that antifungal resistance is not broad spectrum and the difference between CAS and AmB may provide clues as to the molecular pathways that accompany the adaptation processes to microgravity. Specifically, we are evaluating the role of ergosterol in the adaptation process as it is described as being a cellular target for AmB cell association and pore formation [53]. Cell and colony morphology can be used as indicators as to the composition of the local environment since environmental stresses often lead to morphological transformations, including filamentation and colony extrusions [17]. As observed in Figure 7, cells from this study produced colonies with a spikey (or foot projection)-style colony morphology often associated with cells exposed to environmental stresses, such as increased levels of CO2 [8,54]. These studies suggest that cells cultivated in microgravity may produce and then respond to a microenvironment enriched in CO2 and other waste products. Since both flight and terrestrial samples demonstrated the colony projections, it will be important to parse out the contributions of microgravity relative to the environment created within specific hardware. Indeed, whether different types of flight hardware modulate or mask the effects of microgravity is an important consideration in these and other spaceflight studies. There exists a limited, but useful inventory of spaceflight-compatible hardware within the industry, with more being developed continuously. Identifying features that are necessary for successful operations is important and potentially challenging. In the case of C. albicans, hardware choices were constrained by safety precautions related to potential virulence and by the metabolic gas production during growth. This gas production precluded the use of several hardware models because the integrity of individual compartments was routinely compromised by the internal pressure created by metabolic gas. Thus, hardware that provided significant replicative capacity was restricted (for example multi-well units could not withstand the internal pressures produced by the yeast gas production) and some in-flight analyses were deemed less likely to succeed (microscopy, optical density measurements) due to the presence of extensive bubble formation. Thus, hardware choices for microgravity experiments need to be well-vetted and compromises may need to be made in the name of safety and feasibility. It is in this context that the data herein must be interpreted. With limited numbers of replicates, and the corresponding distribution of values, it was encouraging to identify consistent trends in the data. As summarized in Table 3, cells grew to a higher density in microgravity and produce slightly larger colonies than did the terrestrial controls. There was also a consistent trend toward increased resistance to the antifungal agent, AmB. The yeast did not exhibit a filamentation response regardless of conditions, and the colony architecture was not different between samples cultivated in microgravity and the terrestrial controls. We noticed that when there were differences between flight and terrestrial controls, those differences were amplified when the cells grew to a higher density, especially in the FEP bag hardware. The complexity associated with spaceflight experiments and the challenges associated with them dictates the importance of determining whether, and to what extent, ground-based simulators can be predictive of cellular adaptation to the microgravity environment. As such, it is important for investigators to continue exploring biological systems in a variety of spaceflight hardware and to relate those studies to each other as well as ground-based simulators. Comprehensive analyses of these systems in space and on Earth will provide a guide for the predictability of ground-based models and a foundation for investigators to evaluate flight hardware.

    "abstract": "Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab. Subject areas: Omics, Space Sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.",
    "methods": "Methods All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
    "results": "Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification. Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019). Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

    "discussion": "Discussion The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.

Copyright notice ID: 8044432 PMID: 33870146 Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification.Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019).Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.Resource availability Lead contact Jonathan M.

    "introduction": "Introduction For decades, the health risks associated with space exploration have been increasingly documented and characterized. For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS). However, as humankind plans for a permanent presence on the moon and seeks to advance to Mars, the limits to our countermeasures and the research gaps that have insofar remained unaddressed will create health challenges that rival the engineering challenges of long-duration space missions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how spaceflight affects the human body, the molecular responses of the body to spaceflight factors must be robustly profiled. Recent advances in omics technologies have already revolutionized our approach to understanding disease1,2,3 and have created new pathways for tackling health challenges on Earth.4,5,6 However, the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Furthermore, the microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on Earth. Therefore, given that the opportunities to study the influence of spaceflight on the human genome have historically been, and still are, limited, it is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards. The ISS is currently the only research laboratory available off-world and the source of the majority of spaceflight omics experiments performed to date. Most mammalian omics studies aboard the ISS have used Mus musculus, the standard laboratory rodent, as a model organism.7 To scale the number of mammalian studies performed in space, NASA launched their rodent research (RR) program in 2014, with the first omics experiment published in the NASA funded GeneLab database in 2015.8,9 Since the program began, the RR program has launched over a dozen missions generating a steady stream of new omics data on a variety of murine tissues and cell systems. These missions have proven essential for understanding the molecular response of terrestrial life to the environmental stressors of space by providing gene expression data for a subset of mouse tissues. These studies have helped illuminate changes within biological systems including the mitochondria,10 musculoskeletal system,11 circadian rhythm,12 and microRNA (miRNA) profiles.13 The majority of experiments from rodent tissue obtained via the RR missions have been subject to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), where the whole tissue is homogenized and RNA is extracted. Bulk transcriptomic assays are currently the most common omics assay performed in space biology, with more than 270 transcriptomic datasets available from spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue experiments in the NASA GeneLab database.7 Of these studies, microarray-based experiments have been used to obtain approximately half of the gene expression data stored in GeneLab. As the cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) decreased, RNA-seq started to replace microarrays as the predominant method for spaceflight transcriptomic studies. However, given recent advances in the field of genomics, bulk RNA-seq is being displaced by higher-resolution methods rapidly on Earth. State-of-the-art tools can now resolve gene expression at the single-cell level via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)14 or maintain 2D topography via spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT).15 While these two types of approaches are becoming standard practice for gene expression research conducted on Earth, the collection protocols for cells and tissues obtained from experiments in spaceflight have not yet been optimized for the application of these methods. In this perspective piece, we present the current status of scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight experiments, the optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments, and the downstream computational tools that are used to obtain high-resolution gene expression insights.",

In this perspective piece, we present the current status of scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight experiments, the optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments, and the downstream computational tools that are used to obtain high-resolution gene expression insights.scRNA-seq: Importance to spaceflight and prior ISS study designs In less than a decade, the field of scRNA-seq has matured and produced multiple robust protocols for examining the gene expression of individual cells. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the field of transcriptomics that has enabled the identification of new cell types, uncovered rare cell populations, revealed cellular heterogeneity, charted cell-lineage trajectories during development and disease, and profiled the perturbation of cellular states.16,17,18,19,20,21 scRNA-seq also has great potential when applied to cell systems and tissues exposed to spaceflight. While gene expression changes have been observed in cell systems and tissues, the exact cell populations driving these expression differences have not yet been characterized. For example, large changes in gene expression have been observed in the murine retina,22 but the differences attributable to specific retinal subpopulations, such as rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells, have yet to be pinpointed. Similarly, differences in immune function have been observed during spaceflight in the past,23,24,25 where the application of scRNA-seq would have enabled further dissection of specific gene expression differences in the cell populations of, for example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thymus tissue, and bone marrow. Overall, the possibility of identifying exact cell populations that are dysregulated during spaceflight enables the development of more precise therapeutics and countermeasures. While there is a spectrum of approaches for scRNA-seq that have been applied across ground-based experiments, only two platforms (Chromium by 10X Genomics and Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System by BD Biosciences) have been applied to samples flown in spaceflight.26,27 These were applied to two experiments: the second rodent research reference mission (RRRM-2) and the NASA Twins Study. In both, single-cell suspensions were obtained, cells were physically isolated from one another, and polyadenylated mRNA was captured using oligo(dT)s that were uniquely labeled per cell to differentiate mRNA of different cells in the experiment. In the RRRM-2 experiment, 40 mice were flown to the ISS and were part of four distinct groups distinguished by age, duration spent on the ISS, and whether the animal was ISS-terminal or Earth-acclimatized after live animal return (LAR) (Figure 1A). A matching set of 40 mice were also housed on Earth to serve as a ground control. Out of the 80 mice between the ground control and spaceflight groups, 16 animals that were part of the LAR group were selected for single-cell sequencing. Single-cell sequencing of spleen tissue, PBMCs, humerus bone marrow, and femur bone marrow was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Data for these experiments are publicly available in GeneLab28,29,30,31 (Table 1) and analysis of these datasets is underway in NASA’s Analysis Working Groups (https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter). Figure 1. Open in a new tab scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight samples (A) Design for the rodent research reference mission 2 (RRRM-2) experiment. In RRRM-2, two age groups of mice were launched to the ISS. After 32 days, half of the mice from each age group returned to Earth, where they lived 24 additional days before dissection. This was time-matched with the remaining groups of mice in orbit, which were euthanized and frozen in-flight. Sixteen mice total were selected for scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform. Four cell/tissue types were selected for scRNA-seq, and they each have an associated GeneLab Dataset (GLDS) publicly available: femur bone marrow (GLDS-402), humerus bone marrow (GLDS-403), PBMCs (GLDS-404), and spleen tissue (GLDS-405). (B) PBMCs from human blood were obtained before and after spaceflight on the ISS as part of the NASA Twins Study. Whole blood was obtained using venipuncture into a sodium citrate cell processing tube (CPT) and PBMCs were obtained from the buffy coat after centrifugation of the CPT.Table 1. scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight ID Link Mission Tissue Organism GLDS-402 https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-402/ RRRM-2 femur bone marrow C57BL/6NTac mice GLDS-403 https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-403/ RRRM-2 humerus bone marrow C57BL/6NTac mice GLDS-404 https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-404/ RRRM-2 PBMCs C57BL/6NTac mice GLDS-405 https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-405/ RRRM-2 Spleen C57BL/6NTac mice LSDA available upon request to the NASA LSDA NASA Twin Study PBMCs human Open in a new tab A complete list of scRNA-seq datasets from samples exposed to spaceflight. Four datasets are from the RRRM-2 mission and are available on GeneLab. One dataset is from the NASA Twin Study and is part of the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Due to privacy concerns around human genomic data, the Twin Study data is not publicly available but can be requested. The LSDA has a public-facing portal where data requests can be initiated (https://nlsp.nasa.gov/explore/entryform/lsda_data_requests/lsda_data_requests). The LSDA team provides the appropriate processes, tools, and secure infrastructure for archival of experimental data and dissemination while complying with applicable rules, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the management and archival of sensitive data and information.The only other published experiment that has used scRNA-seq from a spaceflight study is the NASA Twins Study.32 In this experiment, a set of identical twins participated in a set of omics assays. One twin served as a ground control and remained on Earth while the other twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS. For scRNA-seq, whole blood was collected via venipuncture into cell processing tubes (CPTs) containing sodium citrate as a preservative (Figure 1B). The CPTs were returned immediately to the lab and centrifuged to collect PBMCs. The BD Biosciences Single-Cell Analysis System was used to collect single-cell expression data (Table 1). One important caveat to this study is that there was no in-flight time point, and blood was collected for scRNA-seq pre-launch and post-landing.13,33 The time it takes to return cargo, such as CPTs, to Earth is one of the factors limiting the ease of single-cell experiments. CPTs can be spun-down and frozen before returning to Earth, but this direct freezing process will lyse cells. With cell lysis, it is still possible to generate a sample-wide RNA-seq profile but not at single-cell resolution. To generate single-cell profiles from spaceflight samples, cells will need to be either returned to Earth immediately or cells will need to be preserved using a process that prevents lysis.Spatially resolved transcriptomics: Leveraging legacy samples and steps for proper experimental design prior to spaceflight While scRNA-seq has greatly improved gene expression experiments, it does have one major limitation: the loss of locational information due to breakdown of tissues into single-cell suspensions. This makes it difficult to identify gene expression changes that may correlate with the topology of the tissue and limits our ability to decipher cell-to-cell interactions and microenvironment-level changes. In order to retain locational information, a variety of SRT methods have been developed in recent years (see Table 2 for a list of recent SRT methods)15,34,35 and applied to a range of sample and tissue types.36,37,38,39 Table 2.

Acronyms used: ISS, in situ sequencing; LCM-seq, laser capture microdissection; TIVA, transcriptome in vivo analysis; HDST, high definition spatial transcriptomics; FF, flash frozen; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. Note that this list is not extensive, and there are several more SRT approaches available. Preference was given to newly developed or unique methods.Due to various complexities in data collection and analysis, SRT methods are less mature than scRNA-seq methods. Additionally, because of the requirement that tissues remain intact during the SRT workflow, these methods are also more sensitive to the tissue types and structures selected for study. This poses an extra challenge when SRT methods are to be applied to legacy space-flown samples that were collected and stored without planning SRT studies from the start of the missions and their morphology is not fully preserved. For these reasons, we believe improvements can be made in the tissue collection process to better preserve tissue morphology. Specifically, when designing future studies to be performed in spaceflight, where specimens will undergo SRT analysis, experiments should first be optimized on Earth before being translated to experiments performed in space. The overall testing cycle for SRT techniques can be divided into three phases: (1) tissue evaluation, (2) tissue preparation, and (3) 2D RNA analysis. Tissue evaluation will require selection of the proper area of interest of the tissue, which may vary in length, width, and thickness depending on the SRT method of interest. Tissue preparation will require testing to determine the optimal duration of exposure to the fixative agent, which may vary depending on tissue type and method of fixation (e.g., flash frozen [FF], formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue, or a different method). It should be noted that most SRT methods to date have been validated with FF and FFPE tissues (Table 2). The third phase, 2D RNA analysis, will analyze the RNA spatial distribution in the tissue under study by applying one of the SRT methods available at the time of the experiment (Table 2). Due to the scarce availability of tissues flown in spaceflight, it is critical that SRT researchers employ a testing cycle before proceeding to their spaceflight samples.Tissue preservation: Challenges in spaceflight and recommendations for improvement Good sample preservation is instrumental to the application of scRNA-seq and SRT on tissues from spaceflight. This stands in contrast to bulk RNA-seq, where RNA is collected and pooled from hundreds of thousands to millions of cells. The sheer volume of RNA collected from these many cells means that partial tissue degradation can occur and still yield enough RNA for sequencing. The tolerance threshold for RNA degradation is much lower for scRNA-seq and SRT due to the high-resolution nature of these methods, compared to bulk RNA-seq. For scRNA-seq and SRT, sufficient RNA for sequencing must be obtained from a smaller number of cells. RNA is known to degrade quickly and can undergo rapid profile changes and degradation in relatively short periods of time resulting in measurable differences within 5 to 10 min of remaining at room temperature postmortem.57 Additionally, RNA that is not preserved rapidly is subject to degradation that can create distinct RNA-seq profiles, and different RNA transcripts can degrade at different rates.58,59 To account for this, samples intended for scRNA-seq must be preserved rapidly after euthanasia. If the experiment requires single-cell sequencing, the cells should be immediately placed in cryopreservation media and slowly brought to freezing temperature to ensure cells do not lyse during the freezing process. Additionally, tissues should be dissociated prior to freezing. Dissociation after freezing is likely to cause damage to cell membranes and increase the likelihood of RNA leakage due to the stresses of the freezing process. An alternative to immediate dissociation is the application of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) where isolation of nuclei can be performed on frozen material, and the nuclei are subsequently used as input for single-cell sequencing.60 In this case, tissue samples can forgo cryopreservation media and should be brought down to freezing temperatures as quickly as possible, ideally snap-freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen if available. Comparisons of snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq in mouse lungs have shown that they have similar gene detection rates, and dissociation bias is reduced in snRNA-seq.61 Likewise, comparisons in kidneys showed similar gene detection rates.62 The recently completed Fly Cell Atlas63 utilized snRNA-seq instead of scRNA-seq because it can be applied consistently even in problematic tissue type (e.g., antennae, wings, fat bodies) and multinucleated cells (e.g., muscle) and because 70%–90% of transcriptomic information is retained with snRNA-seq.63 Moreover, nuclei can be applied as input for single-cell multiomics studies where both the RNA and chromatin accessibility information is captured from the same nucleus simultaneously. Thus, this approach can be extended in spaceflight experiments in the future. Similarly, samples intended for SRT should be frozen immediately after dissection, ideally in a protective embedding medium. This approach preserves both RNA quality and morphology of the tissue. Most of legacy tissues obtained from the ISS did not undergo immediate embedding and freezing for morphology preservation. In the majority of cases, individual organs were not dissected in-flight, but instead were frozen as a whole carcass on the ISS. These samples were returned to Earth where they were thawed, dissected, and re-frozen until ready for downstream sequencing approaches, mostly in bulk. Due to the necessity of organ dissection back in the laboratory on Earth, many rodent samples exposed to the space environment have undergone this double-freezing procedure.64,65,66,67,68 However, this process might lead to partial RNA degradation and deformation of cell and tissue anatomical shape if specific strategies for tissue morphology preservation were not taken into account at the time of freezing. Any deformation can make application of spatial methods very challenging and, in some cases, unfit for SRT methods. There is also evidence that whole-carcass preservation leads to different gene expression profiles than tissues dissected in-flight. One study has demonstrated that whole-carcass preservation in-flight leads to greater variability in RNA integrity numbers (RINs) than tissue dissected in-flight.69 Another study compared bulk RNA-seq profiles between mouse liver tissue dissected and frozen directly on the ISS compared to mice preserved as frozen whole carcasses with their liver tissue dissected back on Earth.70 This study notes that whole-carcass preservation in RNAlater can better preserve the tissues; however, there are a few caveats to this approach. The first caveat is that RNAlater has only had limited success in preserving cells for scRNA-seq on Earth71 and will require further optimization before its application can be recommended for such experiments in spaceflight. The second consideration is that RNAlater can induce a unique gene expression response due to the sulfates present in the solution.72 These gene expression responses may be uneven in SRT methods due to the diffusion gradient generated as RNAlater disperses across a tissue. Third, RNAlater is not a fixative agent and has not been tested to our knowledge at the time of writing for compatibility with fixative reagents used in various SRT methods. Despite the uncertainties in using RNAlater in scRNA-seq and SRT experiments, there is precedent for preserving nucleic acids with RNAlater on the ISS for other sequencing experiments (Table 3). Other reagents with a success in preserving cells and/or nucleic acids on the ISS include using NOTOXhisto, 10% neutral buffer formation (NBF), 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the sequential use of trypsin followed by RNAprotect (Table 3). However, these preservatives are not necessarily suitable for scRNA-seq and SRT due to the lack of testing with scRNA-seq and SRT platforms or due to cell lysis that occurs during the preservation process. The current options with a track record on the ISS are the slow and fast freeze methods to store the tissue at a temperature that will preserve RNA and spatial tissue structure. −80°C freezers available on the ISS can be used to bring tissues down to freezing temperatures, but without a snap-freezing step, this process occurs slowly. To solve this problem, a rapid-freeze instrument was added to the ISS to rapidly bring sample temperatures down to −185°C, to compete with snap-freezing methods that make use of liquid nitrogen that is easily available and safely applied on Earth but not a safe option in a space-based lab73,74,75,76 (Table 3).

In-flight tissue dissection will allow tissues of interest to be rapidly frozen, as smaller pieces of tissue freeze faster than a whole carcass, and will avoid the double freeze-thaw that tissues undergo if they are dissected from a frozen carcass back on Earth. The drawback to this approach is that tissue dissection is time-intensive and will require specialized crew training to teach dissection competency. Despite the time commitment required for in-flight dissection, it has been performed in select cases, such as hindlimb dissection during the RR-6 mission,92 though the data from this in-flight dissection are not publicly available. The second approach, LAR, returns organisms to Earth while still alive where they are euthanized after returning to a ground-based lab.93,94 This allows tissues to be preserved according to the highest standards but presents a different set of limitations. Using LAR, organisms have their circadian rhythms disrupted and experience the stressful conditions of atmospheric re-entry. Moreover, depending on the study design of the mission, LAR organisms have the opportunity to begin reacclimating to Earth’s gravity and radiation landscape. Therefore, all three aspects can impact their transcriptomic profiles. Overall, in spite of the associated limitations, using one of these two options will help circumvent some of the challenges related to the applicability of scRNA-seq and SRT methods on spaceflight samples.Advancing off-world capabilities: Considerations for performing scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight After the challenge of achieving more rigorous preservation standards for scRNA-seq and SRT methods is met, the next goal should be to increase the capabilities of molecular biology experiments in space. Ideally, RNA extractions, PCR, and even scRNA-seq and SRT itself should be performed during spaceflight. Achieving this will require the development of workflows compatible with microgravity and more sophisticated workstations for performing molecular biology experiments. The capabilities for performing molecular biology experiments have increased dramatically over the past decade. In 2016, the first biomolecule sequencer, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, was demonstrated to work in microgravity aboard the ISS.95 Since then, the repertoire of molecular biology experiments performed in-flight has expanded to include environmental microbial sampling, plasmid transformation, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and library prep.96,97,98 While the original biomolecular sequencer study sequenced Mus musculus DNA libraries (prepared on Earth),95 others have been primarily defined in scope of microbial organisms and not to multicellular model organisms, such as C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Mus musculus, or to human samples. In order to build a spaceflight lab capable of performing scRNA-seq and SRT (methods that are most frequently applied to multicellular organisms) the molecular biology pipeline for handling tissues post-dissection throughout the sequencing process must be more well defined. Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of RNA, additional laboratory decontamination protocols may need translation to spaceflight. RNase inhibitors will need to be available to wipe down workstations, pipettes, gloves, and any other surfaces the sample may come in contact with. A microbially decontaminated environment would also enhance the quality of RNA obtained, particularly the use of 70% ethanol, isopropanol, or another disinfectant, given the microbe-rich surfaces aboard the ISS.96,97,99 However, the use of ethanol and isopropanol on the ISS is an issue because aerosolized alcohol interferes with the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSSs) in the closed-loop space station environment (J. Perry et al., 2016, 46th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference). Moreover, the workstation used for handling samples should have minimal airflow that would pass dust or other airborne particulates across the workstation. Some of these considerations may be met via use of the Microgravity Science Glovebox100 aboard the ISS to control airflow and by using benzalkonium chloride (BZK) wipes in place of alcohol-based disinfectants. Establishing and following general guidelines, regularly applied when preparing samples for scRNA-seq and SRT, will help create consistency in sample retrieval, prevent RNA degradation, and obtain high-quality data from spaceflight samples in which RNA quantity and quality are not compromised. One caveat to performing scRNA-seq and SRT methods in spaceflight is that it will require additional crew time to complete experiments that are typically done on Earth after sample return. Robotic automation can help overcome these challenges by reducing the amount of time that crew will need to spend executing experiments (Figure 2A). For example, automated imaging has already been performed aboard the ISS.101 Additionally, automation of library preparation steps has been performed on Earth from a spatially barcoded chip array similar to the 10X Genomics Visium format102 as well as from 10X Genomics Visium arrays.103 However, due to strict volume and mass limitations in-flight, compact solutions may need to be investigated, as would specific testing to accommodate microgravity-driven changes in fluidic behavior. Automating these processes and translating them to spaceflight-compatible hardware will alleviate potential time-costs placed on the crew by performing these experiments in-flight in their entirety. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Computational analysis of spatial transcriptomics data (A) Shows the flow of data that could be unlocked with increased computational automation. The right column shows sequential steps of proposed computational automation onboard spacecraft, with the dotted lines to boxes on the left showing opportunities to transfer data back to Earth. (B) Example of data analysis workflow from the 10X Genomics Visium on the “Mouse Brain Serial Section 2 (Sagittal-Posterior)” dataset available through the 10X Genomics Dataset portal (https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets). Dataset analyzed with Seurat.Another challenge involves the abundance of data generated by sequencing and imaging experiments, which would all need to be stored in-flight and downlinked to Earth. This is particularly relevant to SRT data, which involves either the generation of large fastq files or multiple high-resolution images. To mitigate data downlink challenges, automated software pipelines could be executed in-flight and could convert data into formats with decreased file size. This processed data could then be downlinked to Earth instead of larger, raw files. Thus, onboard data processing could decrease delays in data analysis caused by the transfer of large files. Full transcriptomics analysis pipelines could even be conducted in space, where results, such as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, could be automatically extracted from transcriptomic data in-flight (Figure 2A). Additionally, these results could also be used as feedback to optimize experimental parameters in-flight and increase the quality of future transcriptomic experiments performed in space.Bioinformatic pipelines and considerations for SRT in spaceflight experiments Transcriptomic analyses for bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq are relatively well defined compared to SRT. For bulk RNA-seq, NASA GeneLab has developed an RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) to standardize processing of short-read RNA-seq data,104 which builds upon standard recommendations in the field.105 The RCP is accessible at the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository. However, a standardized pipeline for scRNA-seq is not yet available from NASA GeneLab or international space omics consortia, such as ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing) or the ESA-funded Space Omics Topical Team. Data analysis for scRNA-seq presents many unique challenges related to inferring cell trajectories, clustering cell types, identifying and filtering doublets (when two cells are mistakenly considered as a single cell), handling of sparsity in gene expression count tables, and defining flexible statistical frameworks for discovering complex differential patterns in gene expression.106 Despite these challenges, standardized methods, analysis frameworks, and tutorials are available,107,108,109 which can be extended to analysis of data from space flight experiments. In comparison, the establishment of best practices for the analysis of SRT data is a work in progress. The advent of SRT allows for solving the spatial distribution of transcripts, as well as locating cell types and cell states in complex tissues, organs, and organoids. Standardizing analysis across a wide variety of tissue configurations and the large number of emerging technologies is a difficult and complex task. Knowledge of the types of software tools available for each method can help inform experimental selection decisions about which SRT method best matches the specific scientific questions under investigation. Widely, there are two types of SRT data: single-cell resolution and multi-cell pixel resolution. SRT single-cell resolution data enable the researchers to quantify absolute transcript counts per cell and produce cell gene count tables comparable to scRNA-seq experiments. However, the data are often imaging-based and thus limited in the amount of genes detected in one experiment. On the other hand, the SRT multi-cell pixel resolution data present multiple cells per region of interest and use cell type deconvolution algorithms and label transfer/projection from additional reference scRNA-seq datasets to resolve the cell type composition of the whole-transcriptome region of interest. Regardless of the resolution level of the SRT technique selected, available software packages, for example Seurat110 and Squidpy,111 offer compatibility with several SRT technologies because the structure of the data is similar, meaning that the majority of information comes from transcript counts. Spatial coordinates and cell-level information can be stored as metadata portions of the data object. Both tools include methods for QC (quality control) and preprocessing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization in spatial coordinates and finding spatially variable and spatial marker genes (Figure 2B). However, these do not support data processing and analysis for all SRT methods. Specialized tools have also been developed for cluster analysis,112,113 fusion transcript detection,114 visualization,115 deconvolution of cell-type mixtures,116 inference of extracellular interacting genes,117 identification of sub-tissue architecture/anatomization, finding spatially variable genes,118,119,120 quantifying spatial heterogeneity,121 imputation of missing mRNA expression,122 or improvement of gene expression quantification using spatial, temporal and experimental coordinates. Moreover, comprehensive tools such as STutility builds on the Seurat framework to facilitate analyzing and visualizing multiple samples from the 10X Genomics Visium platform.123 Integration across data types also gives these tools increased investigative potential. For example, integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, achieved with tools such as cell2location124 and stereoscope125 to name a few, can enhance spatial transcriptomics resolution to an unprecedented level.126 Moreover, integration of gene expression data with histology information and spatial location using machine learning (ML) is also under active research.127 For instance, the framework Squidpy is interconnected with Scanpy and the ML Python ecosystem.111 Despite these advances, challenges associated with metadata standards and data processing exist, including reliable cell segmentation, cell-type identification, integration of expression patterns to anatomical features, finding complex patterns, integration of data from different specimens, time points or perturbations, development of standardized metrics and benchmarks, as well as integration across multiple technologies.128 Other analytical challenges remain for the analysis of SRT data, including those related to sample mapping and image registration and segmentation, data representation, imputation of sparse spatial data, integration of multi-modal data, and automatic inference of knowledge for the combination of tissue structure and molecular data.111 While the above challenges exist for both terrestrial and spaceflight SRT data, some are more specific to spaceflight studies due to the problems related to sample collection and processing, such as the formation of ice crystals,129 which can cause morphology changes and tissue damage leading to altered spatial information. In data derived from spaceflight experiments, true morphological and transcriptional variability that results from exposure to microgravity and radiation should not be confused with artifacts created by sample collection, preservation, and transportation. Therefore, if artifacts due to confounding factors cannot be sufficiently minimized via sample processing protocols or specific experimental design, software tools aiming to remove confounding factors (for example, cells affected by ice crystals), improve transcript quantification, and reconstruct morphology and architecture of damaged tissue using image processing techniques will be essential. Specifically, reconstruction of deformed images using image registration or image deconvolution/restoration techniques and the development of computational tools to elucidate space-driven modification of tissue organization will warrant investigation.Future prospects for omics technology in spaceflight The aging ISS, destined to reach its end of life by 2030, has catalyzed an era of “commercial space,” which promises rapid development of the final frontier. To avoid a gap in continuous human presence in space, four private companies are aiming to build and operate commercial space stations in low-Earth orbit. Axiom Space will launch and attach the first segment of its modular space station to the ISS in 2024 and build the remainder of the station while attached to the ISS. The completed Axiom Station will detach to become a free flier by 2030 (https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/nasa-details-intent-to-replace-the-international-space-station-with-a-commercial-space-station-by-2030/). Blue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space to build Orbital Reef, while StarLab will be born out of a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space, and Lockheed Martin. The fourth, yet to be named, space station development effort is being led by Northrup Grumman (https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-signs-agreement-with-nasa-to-design-space-station-for-low-earth-orbit). Furthermore, advances in rocket technology, including reusable engines, have lowered launch costs significantly and increased the cadence of spaceflights to and from the ISS. For example, SpaceX Crew-4 launched to the ISS less than 2 days after Ax-1, Axiom’s private astronaut mission to the ISS, returned to Earth. Research in space has been fundamental to our understanding of how to survive and thrive in the weightless environment. Our knowledge and sophistication of scientific investigations in space is continuously strengthened by advances in hardware technology and operations. Numerous hardware options for biological investigations that require cell culture capabilities and maintenance of live specimen in spaceflight, for instance, are already available. A few examples of include Biopack,130 SABL from BioServe Space Technologies (T. Niederwieser, 2015, 45th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference), Kubik,131 NanoRacks Frame-3, STaARS-1 EF132, and the CubeLab from Space Tango.133 A more current system called the ScienceTaxi (https://www.yurigravity.com/our-service) developed by Yuri Gravity can be integrated into the ISS and into the newer stations coming online; an autonomous version of the ScienceTaxi is in development. This small sampling of hardware options is indicative of the demand for laboratory equipment that is operational in a weightless space environment and the importance of biological experiments conducted in space. Now, in this new era of commercial space with new space stations in development, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage past research experiences in space to re-think and re-design future technologies and laboratories for spaceflight investigations that are on-par with Earth technologies, yet not limited by gravity-based thinking. For example, the speed of technology and methodology innovation for scRNA-seq and SRT is advancing the field rapidly for terrestrial investigations. Future scRNA-seq and SRT methodologies will enable simultaneous multi-omic measurements from individual cells and spatial regions. The potential of these developments has already been commercially realized for single-cell methodologies by 10X Genomics, whose Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kits offer simultaneous measurement of scRNA-seq and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) data from the same group of cells.134,135 Similar developments are in motion for SRT where co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue section via NGS has already been achieved.51 Moreover, spatially resolved ATAC-seq has been developed,136,137 but does not yet allow for simultaneous measurement of RNA. Given the trajectory of the single-cell and spatial fields toward simultaneous measurements of multiple genomic features, it is anticipated that the need for improved cell and tissue preservation protocols in spaceflight will persist. In addition to these creative workarounds, there is an opportunity to design and invent new paradigms for conducting omics and other biological research in space. Space scientists must define the requirements for on-orbit research protocols and outline the specific types of research investigations important to conduct in space, the tools and capabilities necessary for those space investigations, and the criteria for acceptable high-quality science on orbit. These requirements will serve as a guide for commercial space station developers in defining their own orbital lab designs, including hardware capabilities and services. Armed with an understanding of the types of equipment required to conduct the research, commercial space station developers would be better equipped to consider partnerships with terrestrial technology developers that are leading the rapid advances in omics technology and encourage them to adapt their technologies for a weightless space environment by developing future iterations of their technology with space constraints in mind. Although launch costs are reducing and launch frequency is increasing, these costs based on mass and volume are still substantial and prohibitive. Offering end-to-end omics capabilities on orbit that are grounded in the concept of “cloud labs” will be a paradigm shift for space research and science. Cloud labs are essentially a virtual lab bench that allow the scientist to control the wet-lab experiment virtually and execute it remotely via an orchestra of automated robotic systems.138 Presently on the ISS and likely in the foreseeable future, several key operational constraints limit rapid, repeatable research in orbit: (1) limited human-tended time for executing experimental protocols, (2) variability in the on-orbit operator’s scientific and technical experience and expertise, (3) a large distance between the principal investigator (PI) and the scientific payload, and (4) inability to rapidly iterate on experimental protocols in real-time. A cloud lab in space will enable the PI to (1) control the experiment via the virtual lab bench, (2) conduct high-quality science by eliminating a variety of confounding variables that are introduced by returning samples to the ground for processing, and (3) iterate on the scientific protocol based on real-time observations of data. Furthermore, on-orbit edge processing and cloud-computing capabilities will accelerate data analysis whereby processed results can be returned to the PI via a secure downlink from the space station. Addition of such capabilities will eliminate the need for large data downloads—a practice that is slow, costly, and requires extremely high bandwidths. While an upfront investment of capital is required for a state-of-the-art orbital lab, a high return on investment can be expected. Improved on-orbit capabilities that are easier to access and operate will generate greater interest in space-based research investigations, which in turn will increase the demand to leverage spaceflight as an extreme environment for research—for example, the general adaptability of the human body, which may result in the discovery of new molecular mechanisms. It is expected that the reduction in costs to execute orbital science will translate into lower prices for the researcher, thereby generating even greater interest in space. Taken together, these developments will drive a feedforward loop toward greater insights for extending humanity’s footprint in space and improving life on the ground. Even with rapid advances in genomics and spaceflight technology, experimentation in space will remain costly and time-consuming in the foreseeable future. Thus, careful design of experiments is crucial. One factor that may alleviate the risk of these experiments is in silico modeling. Perturbations on transcription and gene expression can be modeled using ML algorithms to test hypotheses prior to launching an experiment into space.139 Adapting these models to be more amenable to the environmental factors of spaceflight can help use limited spaceflight resources more efficiently. Additionally, to aid with experimental design, a specific SRT method should be selected before experiment launch to implement its optimized tissue preservation protocol, and the development status of available computational tools should be rigorously assessed to understand the expected analysis types and data resolutions available. Given the rapid advancements in SRT analysis, ideal tools and capabilities will grow quickly over time. This sector will continue to push for more state-of-the-art knowledge and state-of-the-art technology never attempted before to develop innovative approaches for improving life sciences research in space. It is also a high-risk, high-reward sector, where projects tend to be expensive to fund and maintain but have the potential to unlock discoveries essential for humans to become a multi-planetary species. Through joint collaborations and partnerships and by building on previous milestones, resources, and tools that have been established for spaceflight, we can continue to rapidly advance our in-flight genomics capabilities. Results that emerge from scRNA-seq and SRT experiments conducted in spaceflight are expected to increase our understanding of life in space, genetic control of fundamental processes that are altered by spaceflight, and genomic control mechanisms in cellular biology. Research groups and scientists in the field of space biosciences will continue to generate robust multi-omic profiles of both in vitro and in vivo biospecimens available from previous missions and biospecimen samples returned from future missions. The quality of these data will increase as better preservation protocols and innovative orbital lab solutions are implemented. The results will allow us to pinpoint cell-type-specific and locational disturbances in gene expression and will facilitate the development of countermeasures against spaceflight-associated dysregulation and disease. This goal is also in line with current international collaborative efforts to expand our presence in LEO (low Earth orbit), return to the moon, and progress forward to Mars.Acknowledgments H.C., P.M., D.B., R.H., N.J.S., J.B., and S.G. are members of the ESA Space Omics Topical Team, funded by the ESA grant/contract 4000131202/20/NL/PG/pt “Space Omics: Towards an integrated ESA/NASA – omics database for spaceflight and ground facilities experiments” awarded to R.H., which was the main funding source for this work.
