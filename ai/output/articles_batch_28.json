    "abstract": "Abstract Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Skeletal muscle is crucial for stability, mobility and whole body metabolism. As with all other organs, aging has a detrimental impact on skeletal muscle that can be observed phenotypically as atrophy, susceptibility to damage, fibrosis, and weakness. This age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is often referred to as “sarcopenia.” Sarcopenia occurs in rodents and humans (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002; Kim and others 2008; Lushaj and others 2008; Rice and others 2006). In the human population sarcopenia affects up to 25% of humans that are 65 years and older, and greater than 40% of the population that is ≥ 80 years old (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002). The affect that sarcopenia has on muscle function is clinically important, exemplified by increased susceptibility to muscle fatigue and weakness that lead to a higher risk of fall-related injuries (Marzetti and Leeuwenburgh 2006; Metter and others 2002). With mean lifespan continuing to increase, finding treatments and interventions to slow the process or lessen the impact of sarcopenia on health and quality of life are of critical importance. The plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells, commonly referred to as the sarcolemma, relies on binding of the sarcolemmal scaffolding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for proper membrane integrity. Sarcolemmal scaffolding is manifested as costameres, which are comprised of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and integrin/focal adhesion complexes (Clark and others 2002; Davies and Nowak 2006; Grounds and others 2005). Damage to the sarcolemmal environment can lead to a reduced ability to sense and respond to dynamic changes in mechanical stimuli. Indeed, impairment of sarcolemmal scaffolding and signaling promotes myofiber fragility and leads to overall muscle weakness and limited mobility (Grounds and others 2005; Wu and others 2011). The sarcolemma is increasingly prone to mechanically-induced damage in aged muscle (Faulkner and others 1995). Intriguing observations indicate that compromised integrity of the sarcolemma in conjunction with diminished mechano-signaling contributes to sarcopenia (Ramaswamy and others 2011; Rice and others 2006). For instance, in skeletal muscle from very old mice, sarcolemmal dystrophin becomes discontinuous and elicits decreased membrane integrity and lateral force transmission through the Z-disc to the extracellular matrix (Ramaswamy and others 2011; Rice and others 2006). These findings indicate that muscular dystrophic-like DGC disruptions occur in aging muscle. In various forms of muscular dystrophy, where there is a deficit in sarcolemmal integrity and force transmission, membrane repair proteins are found to be increased compared to muscles from controls (Cagliani and others 2005; Ramaswamy and others 2011). Mechanical and/or biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) stressors can damage the sarcolemma and induce the membrane repair response. Shortly after the damage-inducing event, the membrane repair response occurs in a coordinated fashion, mitsugumin-53 (MG53) is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2 (Cai and others 2009; Roostalu and Strahle 2012). While little is known about the relationship between sarcopenia and cell membrane repair, a similar repair response may be occurring in aged muscle as in the dystrophic muscles. Similar to the various forms of muscular dystrophy, aging is accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress and susceptibility to damage – possibly triggering and contributing to the altered sarcolemmal environment. Skeletal muscle wasting associated with aging is postulated to be due in part to increased levels of oxidative stress (Fulle and others 2004; Kim and others 2008; Ryan and others 2008). In skeletal muscle, there are several oxidant producing sources (Bejma and Ji 1999; Reid 2001), and while many studies have examined the role of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging skeletal muscle (Melov 2000; Van Remmen and Jones 2009), further examination of non-mitochondrial sources of superoxide is needed. NADPH oxidase (Nox) protein complexes have been found in skeletal muscle, with the Nox2 isoform serving as a major source of superoxide generation during contractile activity (Khairallah and others 2012; Pearson and others 2014; Sakellariou and others 2013). In healthy muscle, contractile-induced activity of the membrane-localized Nox2 is crucial for redox signaling and upregulation of cytoprotective functions after cessation of contractions. However, in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nox2 becomes hypersensitive to stretch while Nox2 abundance and activity are elevated, thus exacerbating disease pathology (Whitehead and others 2010). Although recent Nox2 findings in aged skeletal muscle remain inconclusive (Barrientos and others 2015; Nyberg and others 2014; Ryan and others 2010), it is an intriguing possibility that alterations in Nox2 may contribute to the age-associated reduction in membrane integrity. Habitual or lifelong exercise training can limit the rate of sarcopenia (Kim and others 2008; Lawler and Hindle 2011). We have previously demonstrated that lifelong wheel running and mild caloric restriction attenuated age-associated muscle fiber atrophy (Kim and others 2008). However, the effects of lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise on the sarcolemmal environment (i.e., DGC, membrane repair proteins, Nox2) are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate (i) the influence of aging on the sarcolemmal environment in the predominately fast-twitch plantaris muscle, and (ii) how lifelong mild (8%) CR and WR would affect the age-related affects. We hypothesized that aging would lead to a membrane environment that is indicative of reduced integrity and an exaggerated repair response that would be accompanied by increased Nox2 abundance.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Animals Male Fischer-344 rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) at 10–11 weeks of age. Rats were housed at the University of Florida’s Animal Care Services facilities until time of sacrifice at 6 (young) or 24 (old) months of age. A week after arriving at the University of Florida’s facilities, rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 6-month-old sedentary ad libitium (YAL; n = 12), 24-month-old sedentary ad libitium group (OAL; n = 12), 8% caloric restriction (CR) from 11 months-24 months (OCR; n = 12), and 8% CR plus voluntary wheel running (WR) from 11–24 months (OCRWR; n = 12). Studies have shown that rats fed an ad libitum diet have a tendency to run less, but mild CR (8–10%) is substantial enough to prevent the decline in running activity. Therefore, food intake for the two CR groups, OCR and OCRWR, was restricted by 8% below the ad libitum food intake of a separate group of sedentary, age-matched, male Fischer-344 rats that were housed in the same facilities. Although calories were reduced, nutritional balance was maintained for vitamins and trace minerals, as previously described (Kim and others 2008). Throughout the length of the study, food intake in the OCR and OCRWR groups was adjusted weekly based on ad libitum food intake from the previous week. Animals were housed one per cage in a temperature-controlled (20° ± 2.5° C) and light-controlled (12:12 hour light-dark diurnal cycle) room. Sedentary rats were housed under standard conditions in rat cages purchased from Fisher Scientific. OCRWR rats were housed in standard cages equipped with Nalgene Activity Wheels purchased from Fisher Scientific. Activity wheels had a circumference of 1.08 m and were equipped with a magnetic switch and an LCD counter for recording the number of wheel revolutions. The number of revolutions was recorded for each animal on a daily basis. Body weights of all rats were recorded weekly. Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee. 2.2. Tissue Preparation Anesthetization of the Fischer-344 rats was accomplished by way of isoflurane inhalation and sacrificed by cardiac puncture. Upon sacrifice, the plantaris muscle was removed, trimmed of excess tissue (tendons and/or fat), rinsed in PBS, blotted dry, weighed and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle samples for histochemical analysis were washed with PBS, blotted dry, weighed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at optimal length in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) solution and stored at −80° C until analysis (Kim and others 2008). Plantaris muscles were a kind gift to our lab from Dr. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh at the University of Florida. 2.3. Histochemical Staining Plantaris muscle samples were mounted in tissue freezing medium before being cut at a temperature of −15° C and allowed to air-dry for 30 minutes. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining involved incubating the samples with hematoxylin (VWR, cat # 95057-844) for 4 minutes followed by rinsing with tap water. Differentiation was performed using a 75% ethanol and 0.3% glacial acetic acid solution for 15 minutes. Muscle sections were then incubated in eosin (VWR, cat # 95057-846) for 4 minutes. Dehydration of the samples involved two incubations in 95% ethanol, followed by two subsequent incubations in 100% ethanol. Samples and slides were cleared with xylene prior to mounting the cover slips (Vectamount permanent mounting medium, Vector Laboratories, cat # H-5000). H&E stains were visualized and images captured on an Olympus IX-51 (Olympus Imaging America, Inc.) inverted microscope. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured, recorded, and calibrated against a stage micrometer. Plantaris muscles (n = 6 per group) were analyzed with each fiber CSA in square micrometer units calculated using  ImageJ software against the stage micrometer standard. 2.4. Immunohistochemistry To examine protein localization, plantaris muscle sections (n = 6 per group) obtained from the midbelly were serially sectioned at 10 µm thick in a cryostat (Thermo Scientific, Shandon Cryotome FSE) at −15° C and placed onto microscope slides. After acetone fixation, slides were washed in PBS with 0.1% Tween20. Sections were blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 10% goat serum for 15 minutes. After blocking, sections incubated with specific primary antibodies: dystrophin (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat # sc-15376), α-1-syntrophin (1:100, Abcam, cat # ab11187), or nNOS (1:100, Cayman Chemical, cat #160870) for 1 hour in an enclosed chamber at room temperature. After plantaris sections were washed, a 30 minute incubation with the biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:200, Vector Laboratories, cat # BA-1000) secondary antibody in PBS commenced. Cross-sections were washed in PBS before incubating with Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories, cat # PK-61000) for 30 minutes, followed by a 5 min incubation in NovaRed Peroxidase Substrate Solution (Vector Laboratories, cat # SK-4800). Slides were washed and subsequently mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium Hard Set (Vector Laboratories, cat # H-1000). Membrane protein localization for dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS was quantified using an edge filter macro developed for the  ImageJ software program. Samples in each group were analyzed under identical conditions. 2.5. Western Blot Analysis Upon sacrifice, plantaris muscles were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to being stored at −80°C until subsequent analysis. Plantaris muscles were pooled together (n = 5 per group), minced, weighed and suspended (15:1 w/v) in ice-cold lysis buffer composed of 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce protease inhibitor, Thermo Scientific, cat # 88666). Muscles were homogenized in a ground glass-on-ground glass mortar and pestle at 4° C. Homogenates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g (4°C). The resulting supernatant was used for protein quantification. Protein concentration of the supernatant fraction was measured using the Bradford protein assay, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, cat # 500-0006). Tissue extracts were subsequently aliquoted and stored at −80°C until western blot analysis. Plantaris tissue extracts (20 µg or 40 µg) along with sample buffer were loaded into wells of 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was conducted at 120 V for ~70 min. Gels were transferred at 100 V for 60 min onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad, cat # 162-0112). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h. After blocking, membranes incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer with the appropriate primary antibody: anti-syntrophin alpha 1 (1:2500, Abcam, cat # ab11187), anti-nNOS (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 610309), anti-MG53/TRIM72 (1:2500, ProSci, cat # 25-812), anti-dysferlin (1:2500, Novacastra, NCL-Hamlet), anti-annexin II (A2) (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 610068), anti-annexin VI (A6) (1:1000, Abcam, cat # ab31206), anti-gp91phox (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 611415), anti-p67phox (1:2500, BD Biosciences, cat # 610913), anti-p47phox (1:750, BD Biosciences, cat # 610355), and anti-Rac1 (1:500, EMD Millipore, cat # 07-1464). Following TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 washes, membranes were incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat # sc-2004 or sc-2005) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After TBS-T washes, proteins were visualized by Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific, cat # 34076) enhanced chemiluminescence detection and developed with the Fuji LAS-3000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (FujiFilm Medical Systems). Quantification was performed using  ImageJ software. Ponceau-S staining (band ~38 kDa mark) was used as a loading control. 2.6. Statistical Analysis All data reported here are as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences among YA, OA, OCR, and OCRWR. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was utilized when necessary. Significance level for all tests was set at p < 0.05.",

Age-related decrease in plantaris fiber CSA is mitigated by lifelong CR and WR As published by Kim et al., average body mass of OAL rats (389.7 g) was not significantly different than YAL rats (374.3 g) (Kim and others 2008). However, mean body mass of the OCRWR rats (341.3 g) was significantly lower than the other three groups – YAL, OAL, and OCR. Relative muscle mass to body mass ratio was not significantly different between OAL and YAL rats (1.67 g/kg v. 1.74 g/kg). In contrast, muscle to body mass ratio was significantly increased in OCRWR rats (1.80 g/kg) when compared to OAL (p<0.01) and OCR (p<0.001) groups (Kim and others 2008). Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in the plantaris muscles was quantified following Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 1 A–C). CSA of muscle fibers is an indicator of muscle atrophy and thus sarcopenia. Compared to YAL fibers (3148 µm2 ± 82.17), each of the old groups were found to have significantly smaller fiber CSA (p<0.0001 OAL; p=0.0025 OCR; p=0.0005 OCRWR). However, both lifelong interventions (CR and CRWR) mitigated the age-related decline in mean muscle fiber CSA, with fiber CSA in OCR (2786 µm2 ± 77.01) and OCRWR (2778 µm2 ± 64.43) groups significantly larger than those found in the OAL group (2264 µm2 ± 49.21; p<0.0001 in each instance) (Fig. 1B). Distribution of plantaris fibers from OAL were mostly under 2500 µm2 (~74% of all fibers), whereas OCR muscles contained approximately 58% and OCRWR muscles only 55% of fibers that were smaller than 2500 µm2 (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these findings indicate that lifelong CR and CRWR limit the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and fiber CSA, thus limiting the decline in muscle function. Fig. 1.

Lifelong CR and WR attenuated disruption of sarcolemmal localized DGC proteins We examined the localization of three key DGC proteins: dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS. These DGC proteins are normally localized near the sarcolemma. Dystrophin, which normally binds to the transmembrane protein β-dystroglycan, as well as α-syntrophin and dystrobrevin, is tightly associated with the sarcolemma. nNOSµ is bound to α- or β-syntrophin in healthy, skeletal muscle, but may detach during Duchenne and other muscular dystrophies and disuse (Brenman and others 1995; Finanger Hedderick and others 2011; Suzuki and others 2007). Aging did not have an effect on the sarcolemmal content of dystrophin in the plantaris muscle fibers (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, CR and WR interventions contained significantly greater levels of sarcolemmal-localized dystrophin compared to the OAL fibers (+18.4%, p=0.0002 OCR and +24.4%, p<0.0001 OCRWR compared to OAL; Fig. 2A and B). In addition, OCR and OCRWR fibers had significantly greater sarcolemmal dystrophin than YAL (+17% OCR, p=0.0012 and +22.9%, p<0.0001 OCRWR compared to YAL; Fig. 2A and B). Although the overall sarcolemmal content of dystrophin between YAL and OAL was not deemed significantly different, it was apparent that a discontinuous sarcolemmal pattern existed for the OAL fibers (Fig. 2A). This was an effect that was ameliorated by the lifelong interventions of CR and CRWR, with OCRWR dystrophin immunostaining appearing very similar in consistency to that of the YAL plantaris fibers (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Immunostaining of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins in plantaris muscle fibers from young ad libitum (YAL), old ad libitum (OAL), old - mild calorie restricted rats (OCR) and old - mild calorie restricted plus exercise rats (OCRWR).

Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Significance level was set a p < 0.05. (a) Indicates significant difference from YAL group; (b) Indicates significant difference from OAL group. Dystrophin and α-syntrophin images were taken at 20× magnification (scale bar set at 50 µm) and nNOS images were taken at 16× magnification (scale bar set at 100 µm). Ponceau S Red stain (GAPDH – 38 kDa mark) used as a loading control for western blots.As mentioned above, α-syntrophin binds to dystrophin and is commonly found near the sarcolemma. In aged plantaris muscle fibers, α-syntrophin was largely disassociated from the sarcolemma (Fig 2A). However, CR and CRWR led to significant increases in sarcolemmal localized α-syntrophin compared to the ad-libitum fed groups, with OCR having 25.8% more than OAL and 17% more than YAL (p<0.0001 for OAL v. OCR and OCRWR; Fig. 2A and B), while OCRWR contained 31.2% more than OAL and 22.7% more than YAL (p<0.0001 for YAL v. OCR and OCRWR; Fig. 2A and B). As can be seen in Fig. 2A, continuity of α-syntrophin near the membrane is best preserved with the combination of WR with CR. Overall protein content of α-syntrophin was found to be significantly higher in the OAL plantaris fibers compared to YAL (p = 0.01), whereas the OCR and OCRWR content was not deemed significantly higher than YAL or significantly lower than OAL (Fig. 2C). The mu splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) is normally found bound to α-syntrophin and dystrobrevin and indirectly to dystrophin. In healthy muscle nNOS is involved in several signaling events related to regulation of muscle mass, force generation and susceptibility to fatigue (Brenman and others 1995; Kobayashi and others 2008; Percival and others 2008). Protein concentration of nNOS (relative to ponceau red staining) was not found to be significantly different between YAL and OAL (Fig. 2C and D). Although CR and CRWR interventions did not affect nNOS protein abundance significantly, compared to OAL, OCRWR trended toward a significant increase with a p-value of 0.08 (+26% compared to OAL, Fig. 2D). Even though nNOS protein content was not found to be significantly different across groups, nNOS localization was altered with aging (Fig. 2A and B). Aging resulted in a significant decrease of sarcolemmal localized nNOS when comparing YAL to OAL plantaris fibers (−59%, p<0.0001 OAL compared to YAL, Fig. 2B). Lifelong CR and the addition of WR mitigated the mislocalization of nNOS, with 94.4% more in the OCR (p <0.0001) and 100.7% more sarcolemmal nNOS in the OCRWR (p <0.0001) compared to OAL (Fig. 2B). However, the interventions were not able to completely maintain the YAL sarcolemmal phenotype. 3.3. Sedentary, ad-libitum aging is associated with dramatic increases in membrane repair proteins As indicated by previous studies (Leiter and others 2012; Rice and others 2006) and suggested by our DGC findings, sarcolemmal damage occurs with sedentary, ad libitum aging. To examine this further, we investigated how aging as well as lifelong diet and exercise interventions, on membrane-repair machinery in aged muscle fibers. We chose to measure the protein content of four proteins that have been strongly tied to membrane repair processes: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2. Membrane damage is normally followed by a repair response to restore integrity to the membrane and maintain homeostasis. Our observations indicate that there is significant increase in MG53 (p < 0.0001), dysferlin (p < 0.0001), annexin A6 (p < 0.0001) and annexin A2 (p = 0.004) abundance in the OAL rats compared to YAL (Fig. 3). The lifelong intervention of CR+WR was capable of maintaining at or near control YAL levels of MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2 (Fig. 3A and B). Plantaris muscles from OCR rats were found to contain significantly more dysferlin (p = 0.011) than OCRWR, but significantly less than OAL (p = 0.0005). Old CR muscles also contained significantly less annexin A6 (p < 0.0001) than OAL, but significantly more than YAL (p = 0.026) and OCRWR (p = 0.0003). Interestingly, the exercised group (OCRWR) contained the lowest levels of repair proteins out of the four groups (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3.

(a) Indicates significant difference from YAL group; (b) Indicates significant difference from OAL group. (c) Indicates significant difference from OCR group. Ponceau S Red stain (GAPDH – 38 kDa mark) was used as a loading control for western blots. 3.4. Lifelong CR and WR ameliorate the age-related reduction in Nox2 abundance Presently, the level of involvement that Nox2 plays during the sarcopenic process remains unclear, and thus investigation of Nox2 isoforms in the aging plantaris and the effects of lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running were investigated. In the present study, we found that aging was associated with a reduced abundance of Nox2 subunits (Fig. 4A and B). There was a trend for an age-related decrease (−45%) in the transmembrane catalytic subunit, gp91phox, comparing YAL to OAL (p=0.096; Fig. 4B). Regulatory cytosolic subunits, p47phox and p67phox, displayed a significant age-related reduction in protein content (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively; Fig. 4B). No significant difference was observed between YAL and OAL in the levels of the microtubule-associated Nox2 subunit Rac-1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, gp91phox, p67phox, and p47phox were expressed at significantly higher protein levels in the OCR compared to OAL plantaris (Fig. 4B). Lifelong CR+WR muscles trended toward a significant increase in levels of gp91phox (+81.1%, p=0.096) and reached significant increases in protein abundance of p67phox (+70.9%, p = 0.0009) and p47phox (+128.4%, p = 0.0002) compared to OAL (Fig. 4B). Overall, each Nox2 subunit exhibited a similar trend of an age-related decrease. With the exception of p67phox, which was significantly higher in the OCR than YAL group (p=0.03), Nox2 subunits in OCR and OCRWR muscle were not significantly different than YAL. Fig. 4.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion In the current study, we report that lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and CR plus lifelong voluntary wheel running (WR) are interventions capable of partially preventing the age-associated decrease in plantaris muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Additionally, lifelong CR and CRWR offered protection against age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment, which may aid in maintenance of skeletal muscle functionality and overall health. We observed that sedentary aging led to discontinuous sarcolemmal patterning of key DGC proteins, such as dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS, an effect that was prevented by the addition of lifelong CR and CRWR. Inconsistent sarcolemmal patterning of DGC proteins is indicative of reduced membrane integrity; therefore, we examined proteins involved in membrane repair. Sedentary, ad libitum aging (OAL) had increased abundance of membrane repair proteins: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6 and annexin A2. In order to elucidate the potential role of membrane-generated oxidative stress in the age-related reduction in membrane integrity, we sought to determine the role of the membrane-bound superoxide producing NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) complex. We identified several crucial Nox2 protein subunits that were significantly reduced with sedentary aging (OAL), which is prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Thus, our data indicates that sedentary, ad-libitum aging is associated with reduced sarcolemmal integrity, increased sarcolemmal damage, altered membrane redox environment, all of which are likely associated with the progression of sarcopenia. Lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were capable of mitigating the negative age-related alterations, consequently providing a myofiber environment conducive for better overall muscle health and function. A detailed discussion of our major findings follows. 4.1. Effect of CR and WR on muscle fiber atrophy Previous studies showed that sarcopenia can be attenuated by dietary restriction (Hepple and others 2008; McKiernan and others 2004) and/or exercise (Kim and others 2008; Pasini and others 2012). While Wohlgemuth and colleagues did not find significantly increased muscle to body mass ratios in the old CR or old CR + exercise rats compared to OAL (Wohlgemuth and others 2010), our lab previously showed that lifelong dietary restriction + exercise resulted in a muscle : body mass that was significantly increased compared to sedentary, ad-libitum fed, aged rats (Kim and others 2008). Our previous findings exhibited an age-related decrease in plantaris fiber CSA, an effect prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR (Kim and others 2008). Here, we have observed the partial protection of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) by lifelong mild (8%) CR and CR plus WR (Fig 1). The present study demonstrated a protective effect of lifelong CR and WR + CR on plantaris fiber cross-sectional area compared with lifelong, sedentary rats fed ad libitum. Our lab noted that lifelong CR and CRWR prevented the increase in extramyocyte space and connective tissue exhibited in sedentary aged rats (Kim and others 2008). However, unlike Kim et al. (Kim and others 2008), in the present study the plantaris fiber CSA in OCR and OCRWR rats remained significantly smaller than YAL. If muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased and fiber number is reduced with aging due to apoptosis (Marzetti and others 2008), then extracellular matrix of connective tissue and fat must compromise a larger proportion of aging muscle mass (Kim and others 2008). This is consistent with a reduction in muscle quality (force per cross-sectional area) with progressive age (Brooks and Faulkner 1994; Thompson 2009). 4.2. Protection by CR and CRWR against DGC alterations in aged plantaris muscle The costameric DGC acts as a mechanosensitive scaffold of proteins that are responsible for force transmission, structural integrity of the cell, and transmission of cellular signaling processes from the extracellular environment (Grounds and others 2005; Gumerson and Michele 2011). Loss of, or decreased expression of, DGC proteins signifies a decrease in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma and leads to myofiber loss (Davies and Nowak 2006; Rice and others 2006). Here, we report a discontinuity of membrane-associated dystrophin with aging, but not overall expression, and a dissociation of α-syntrophin was noted (Fig. 2). This discontinuity was mitigated by the long-term interventions of CR and CRWR. Moreover, the lifelong CR and CRWR interventions not only proved to be effective at maintaining the sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin and α-syntrophin, but also resulted in increased sarcolemmal content of the DGC proteins, concomitant with larger muscle fiber size than OAL. Recently, Ramaswamy et al. identified the mechanical consequences of age-related disruption in the DGC, as manifested as a roughly 50% loss of lateral force transmission, and thus the integrity of the parallel elastic element in both rats and mice (Ramaswamy and others 2011). Very old rats (34–35 months of age) displayed impaired lateral transmission of force, there was a concomitant discontinuity in dystrophin (Ramaswamy and others 2011). When coupled with the current data that illustrate a substantial disruption of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOSµ), perturbations in DGC-ECM interface with aging could compromise myofiber structural integrity. For example, Rice et al. showed that aging led discontinuous positive staining on the sarcolemma for dystrophin, while membrane content increased in the EDL of 36 month old rats (Rice and others 2006). Indeed, dystrophin was absent from discrete sections of sarcolemma (Rice and others 2006) similar to the plantaris muscles from the sedentary, ad-libitum aged (OAL) group. When a discontinuous and patchy membrane accumulation of dystrophin exists, there is a reduction in membrane and muscle fiber integrity (Faulkner and others 1995). Bound to dystrophin, α-Syntrophin is a DGC protein that binds to and attaches nNOSµ to the DGC. We found a significant increase in total α-syntrophin in the OAL compared to YAL plantaris muscles (Fig. 2). Similar to the dystrophin data from Rice et al. (Rice and others 2006), an increase in α-syntrophin protein content was accompanied by discontinuous disruption of sarcolemmal α-syntrophin in the OAL group (Fig 2). Furthermore, mice lacking dystrophin are unable to localize α-syntrophin to the sarcolemma (Brenman and others 1995; Grounds and others 2005), consistent with shared poor linkages by costameres and lateral force generation (Ramaswamy and others 2011). Membrane-associated α-syntrophin may also regulate protein turnover and remodeling, where the laminin – β-dystroglycan interaction permits sarcolemmal-localized α-syntrophin mediated phosphorylation of Akt (Zhou and others 2007). The mu splice variant of nNOS (nNOSµ) is normally bound to α-syntrophin and thus anchored near the sarcolemma. nNOSµ has been identified as a key signaling protein that regulates muscle mass in response to changes in loading, augments force production, and reduces muscular fatigue (Kobayashi and others 2008; Percival and others 2008; Percival and others 2010). Here lifelong CRWR resulted in a non-significant (p = 0.08) increase of total nNOS compared to sedentary, ad-libitum aging, and was not impacted by aging. Sarcolemmal nNOS was drastically mislocalized in aged plantaris muscle fibers, where it was observed predominately in the sarcoplasm. Previously, our group (Lawler and others 2014) and Suzuki et al. (Suzuki and others 2007) found that mechanical unloading and denervation cause translocation of nNOSµ away from the sarcolemma. Mislocalization of nNOS is also noted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Brenman and others 1995) and other types of neuromuscular disorders (Finanger Hedderick and others 2011), further emphasizing the physiological importance of the protein for proper muscle function to occur. The current study identified a loss of sarcolemmal, but not overall nNOS. Recent aging literature indicates that nNOS location, muscle, and physical activity have impacted age-related changes. We previously observed that constitutive NOS activity is reduced by aging (Song and others 2009). Overall nNOS protein levels were reduced in the soleus, but not the rat gastrocnemius. Pearson et al. (Pearson and others 2015) did not find a reduction in total nNOS protein abundance from old C57Bl/6 mice. In contrast, Samengo et al., showed a 41% decline of nNOSµ expression levels in the quadricep muscles of 2 year old mice along with a concomitant decrease in protein content (Samengo and others 2012). In our study, CR and CRWR, proved to be effective at maintaining sarcolemmal nNOS compared to OAL fibers (Fig. 2). Previously, we found that exercise training increased nNOS protein expression in both muscles (Song and others 2009). Lieter et al. (2012) found that cytoplasmic localization of nNOS is greater in quadriceps of 19.5 month old mice vs. young mice, which could exacerbate proteolysis and atrophy (Suzuki and others 2007). However, 6 weeks of administration of an NO-donor drug and 3 weeks of exercise in 18 month old mice prevented mislocalization of nNOS, concomitant with muscle hypertrophy (Leiter and others 2012). Consistently, loss of sarcolemmal nNOS was causal in skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area during disuse (Lawler and others 2014; Suzuki and others 2007). The physiological importance of DGC localization of nNOSµ for healthy regulation of skeletal muscle size, damage, and repair is substantial. Therefore, lifelong CR and CRWR preserves a more continuous membrane patterning of key DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS), which could improve membrane and mechano-signaling, and protect against sarcopenia. 4.3. Effect of aging on sarcolemmal repair Given that aging was associated with a discontinuous loss of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOS) from the sarcolemma, we postulate that aging may be conferring a “mild dystrophic phenotype” on skeletal muscle. Since the DGC offers stability to the sarcolemma (Blake and others 2002), a weakened DGC could compromise sarcolemmal integrity and increase the risk of membrane leakage and fiber damage (Petrof and others 1993). Indeed, loss of sarcolemmal dystrophin results in muscle fibers that are more prone to contraction-induced injury, due to impaired ability of lateral force transference from the Z-disc through the costameres into the ECM (Lovering and De Deyne 2004). When dystrophin is lost, shear forces are elevated which can trigger ROS and Ca2+ mediated damage to the muscle fiber with repeated eccentric contractions (Lovering and De Deyne 2004). Compromised DGC leads to uncontrolled damage-repair cycling, fiber death, and eventual replacement with fibrotic tissue (Mann and others 2011; Serrano and others 2011). Therefore, an intact plasma membrane environment and efficient repair of the cell membrane are crucial to maintenance of cellular homeostasis. When stressed by mechanical and biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) perturbations, a cadre of membrane repair proteins guide vacuole sequestration, repair, and patching of damaged phospholipid membranes. Specifically, MG53, dysferlin, and annexin A6 are sequestered to membrane lesions to repair and reseal damaged sarcolemma, followed by recruitment of annexins A2 and A1 to complete scaffolding of the membrane patch. In this coordinated membrane repair, MG53 is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2 (Cai and others 2009; Roostalu and Strahle 2012). Given that old sedentary, fed ad libitum expressed high levels of membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, annexin A2) (Fig. 3), we postulate that there is an enhanced requirement for phospholipid membrane repair in aging skeletal muscle. Lifelong exercise + mild caloric restriction (diet) maintained membrane repair proteins near control (YAL) levels, suggesting protection against cell membrane damage and thus the need for heightened repair (Fig. 3). Interestingly, CR alone was unable to maintain membrane repair proteins at YAL levels, particularly for annexin A6 (Fig. 3). Thus chronic exercise is required to better protect the environment of the aging sarcolemma. Indeed, we previously noted (Kim and others 2008) that lifelong wheel running plus mild CR abrogated age-related elevation of total hydroperoxides; while caloric restriction alone did not prevent age-related elevation of lipid hydroperoxides. Cagliani et al. observed annexin A1 and A2 levels were overexpressed in parallel in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy characterized by high levels of membrane damage and lipid peroxidation (Cagliani and others 2005). Thus lipid peroxidation and upregulation of membrane repair proteins are characteristics shared by aging and dystrophic muscle. In contrast, lifelong wheel running mitigated age-associated upregulation of MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2 (Fig. 3). Given that Alloush et al. reported 8 weeks of treadmill exercise training in C57Bl/6 mice had no effect upon three repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, caveolin-3) in the soleus muscle, long-term physical activity would then logically be a preservation effect. Thus we would argue that habitual exercise maintains long-term homeostasis of the lipid membrane environment, linked to preservation of the DGC, and reduction of sarcopenia. 4.4. Nox2 and aging muscle Oxidative stress increases during the aging process in skeletal muscle, as with most tissues. (Ji and others 1998; Kim and others 2008). High levels of oxidative stress have been linked to sarcopenia: muscle fiber CSA, muscular strength, and performance (Bejma and Ji 1999; Kim and others 2008). Sources of ROS in skeletal muscle include the mitochondrial electron transport chain, prostaglandin metabolism, xanthine oxidase, and NADPH oxidases (Nox). Nox2 is a multi-protein enzyme complex that consists of membrane-bound catalytic gp91phox and regulatory p22phox, and regulatory cytosolic subunits: p47phox, p67phox, and the small-GTPase Rac1. Nox2 has been found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Xia and others 2003), t-tubules (Espinosa and others 2006), and the sarcolemma (Javeshghani and others 2002). Nox2 is the most likely source of O2•− in skeletal muscle during contraction and stretch of healthy skeletal muscles, and not mitochondria (Sakellariou and others 2013). However, Nox2 becomes hyper-responsive to stretch in dystrophic mice, contributing to excessive Ca(2+) entry into the fibers and fueling debilitating myopathy (Whitehead and others 2010). Furthermore, Nox2 is elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to disuse atrophy (Lawler and others 2014). Surprisingly, we found that ad libitum, sedentary aged (OAL) rats contained significantly lower protein levels of cytosolic Nox2 subunits: p67phox and p47phox. In addition, the microtubule-associated subunit Rac1 exhibited a similar trend downward with age. Recently, Barrientos et al. found that p47phox displayed a non-significant downward trend with age (p=0.08) (Barrientos and others 2015), while Ryan and colleagues reported that total NADPH oxidase activity in the gastrocnemius was unaltered by age, following protein trends for the Nox4 isoform (Ryan and others 2010). Therefore, it is possible age-related changes in Nox2 expression may vary with subcellular localization, species, and independent of Nox4 protein expression. We postulate that the aging membrane environment may be unsuitable for normal response of Nox2 to contractions. Whereas lifelong physical activity may act to preserve normal Nox2 complex structure via maintaining a healthy membrane environmental phenotype. Here we found that lifelong wheel running maintained high abundance of gp91phox and p47phox (Fig. 4). Thus we argue that inducibility of the Nox2 complex by exercise is maintained in healthy aging when exercise is chronic or habitual. Given that cellular oxidative stress is increased in aging skeletal muscle, (Lawler and others 2014; Sakellariou and others 2014; Whitehead and others 2010), it can be inferred that the sources independent of Nox2 may drive age-related oxidative stress. In young healthy muscle, Nox2 participates in contractile – induced cell signaling (Khairallah and others 2012; Sakellariou and others 2013) and insulin signaling (Contreras-Ferrat and others 2014; Espinosa and others 2009). However, overproduction of Nox2 contributes to pathology with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Khairallah and others 2012; Whitehead and others 2010), hypertension (Frey and others 2009), and possible disuse (Lawler and others 2014). In contrast, baseline ROS released from mitochondria are elevated with Type II diabetes and aging (Anderson and others 2009; Janssen-Heininger and others 2008). Therefore, the yin-yang relationship between Nox2 and mitochondria may be substantially disrupted with aging, yet protected by lifelong diet and exercise interventions. Clearly, additional investigations are necessary to unravel this intriguing mystery. 4.5. Limitations Experimental design and tissue limitation did not allow sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 and repair proteins or membrane damage, other than previous morphological histology (Kim and others 2008). Unfortunately, we were unable to inject the rats with Evans blue dye to determine damage and necrosis since that could have interfered with other experimental objectives. Due to a limited amount of tissue reserved for histochemical analysis, we were also unable to stain the plantaris muscles with IgG in an effort to examine tissue damage. These are unfortunate short-comings that should definitely be addressed in future studies in order to provide more details and connections as to the sarcolemmal integrity issues that appear to be occurring in aged animals. However, we were able to show that proteins that are normally associated with membrane repair were elevated in OAL muscle. Another drawback is that we only used male rats, leaving the question of potential sex-related differences unanswered. In addition, tissue mass and assay demands limited our ability to isolate and analyze mitochondrial ROS. Since the experimental design did not call for a lifelong WR only exercise group because 8% CR is needed to encourage voluntary lifelong wheel running activity, we were unable to differentiate the effects of WR from the effects of CR. We have previously shown that wheel running may have additive or synergistic protection against age-related changes in morphology and cell signaling (Kim and others 2008).",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions In summary, aging was associated with a disruption of the membrane environment, affecting sarcolemmal expression of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex proteins, membrane repair proteins, and Nox2 subunits. Furthermore, age-related perturbations in DGC, membrane repair proteins, and Nox2 subunits were consistently mitigated by lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running. These highly novel findings in protective cell signaling conferred lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary exercise were also linked to significant abrogation of aging-associated reduction in relative muscle weight and CSA. Therefore, lifelong CR and WR may prevent age-related impairment of overall muscle quality and sarcopenia, which could yield better quality of life and resistance to chronic disease and frailty.",

Copyright notice ID: 5026642 MSID: MS812405 PMID: 27534381 The publisher's version of this article is available at Exp Gerontol Abstract Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment. Keywords: Sarcopenia, Aging Muscle, Calorie Restriction, Exercise, Wheel Running, Sarcolemma1. Introduction Skeletal muscle is crucial for stability, mobility and whole body metabolism. As with all other organs, aging has a detrimental impact on skeletal muscle that can be observed phenotypically as atrophy, susceptibility to damage, fibrosis, and weakness. This age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is often referred to as “sarcopenia.” Sarcopenia occurs in rodents and humans (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002; Kim and others 2008; Lushaj and others 2008; Rice and others 2006). In the human population sarcopenia affects up to 25% of humans that are 65 years and older, and greater than 40% of the population that is ≥ 80 years old (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002). The affect that sarcopenia has on muscle function is clinically important, exemplified by increased susceptibility to muscle fatigue and weakness that lead to a higher risk of fall-related injuries (Marzetti and Leeuwenburgh 2006; Metter and others 2002). With mean lifespan continuing to increase, finding treatments and interventions to slow the process or lessen the impact of sarcopenia on health and quality of life are of critical importance. The plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells, commonly referred to as the sarcolemma, relies on binding of the sarcolemmal scaffolding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for proper membrane integrity. Sarcolemmal scaffolding is manifested as costameres, which are comprised of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and integrin/focal adhesion complexes (Clark and others 2002; Davies and Nowak 2006; Grounds and others 2005). Damage to the sarcolemmal environment can lead to a reduced ability to sense and respond to dynamic changes in mechanical stimuli. Indeed, impairment of sarcolemmal scaffolding and signaling promotes myofiber fragility and leads to overall muscle weakness and limited mobility (Grounds and others 2005; Wu and others 2011). The sarcolemma is increasingly prone to mechanically-induced damage in aged muscle (Faulkner and others 1995). Intriguing observations indicate that compromised integrity of the sarcolemma in conjunction with diminished mechano-signaling contributes to sarcopenia (Ramaswamy and others 2011; Rice and others 2006). For instance, in skeletal muscle from very old mice, sarcolemmal dystrophin becomes discontinuous and elicits decreased membrane integrity and lateral force transmission through the Z-disc to the extracellular matrix (Ramaswamy and others 2011; Rice and others 2006). These findings indicate that muscular dystrophic-like DGC disruptions occur in aging muscle. In various forms of muscular dystrophy, where there is a deficit in sarcolemmal integrity and force transmission, membrane repair proteins are found to be increased compared to muscles from controls (Cagliani and others 2005; Ramaswamy and others 2011). Mechanical and/or biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) stressors can damage the sarcolemma and induce the membrane repair response. Shortly after the damage-inducing event, the membrane repair response occurs in a coordinated fashion, mitsugumin-53 (MG53) is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2 (Cai and others 2009; Roostalu and Strahle 2012). While little is known about the relationship between sarcopenia and cell membrane repair, a similar repair response may be occurring in aged muscle as in the dystrophic muscles. Similar to the various forms of muscular dystrophy, aging is accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress and susceptibility to damage – possibly triggering and contributing to the altered sarcolemmal environment. Skeletal muscle wasting associated with aging is postulated to be due in part to increased levels of oxidative stress (Fulle and others 2004; Kim and others 2008; Ryan and others 2008). In skeletal muscle, there are several oxidant producing sources (Bejma and Ji 1999; Reid 2001), and while many studies have examined the role of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging skeletal muscle (Melov 2000; Van Remmen and Jones 2009), further examination of non-mitochondrial sources of superoxide is needed. NADPH oxidase (Nox) protein complexes have been found in skeletal muscle, with the Nox2 isoform serving as a major source of superoxide generation during contractile activity (Khairallah and others 2012; Pearson and others 2014; Sakellariou and others 2013). In healthy muscle, contractile-induced activity of the membrane-localized Nox2 is crucial for redox signaling and upregulation of cytoprotective functions after cessation of contractions. However, in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nox2 becomes hypersensitive to stretch while Nox2 abundance and activity are elevated, thus exacerbating disease pathology (Whitehead and others 2010). Although recent Nox2 findings in aged skeletal muscle remain inconclusive (Barrientos and others 2015; Nyberg and others 2014; Ryan and others 2010), it is an intriguing possibility that alterations in Nox2 may contribute to the age-associated reduction in membrane integrity. Habitual or lifelong exercise training can limit the rate of sarcopenia (Kim and others 2008; Lawler and Hindle 2011). We have previously demonstrated that lifelong wheel running and mild caloric restriction attenuated age-associated muscle fiber atrophy (Kim and others 2008). However, the effects of lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise on the sarcolemmal environment (i.e., DGC, membrane repair proteins, Nox2) are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate (i) the influence of aging on the sarcolemmal environment in the predominately fast-twitch plantaris muscle, and (ii) how lifelong mild (8%) CR and WR would affect the age-related affects. We hypothesized that aging would lead to a membrane environment that is indicative of reduced integrity and an exaggerated repair response that would be accompanied by increased Nox2 abundance.2. Methods 2.1. Animals Male Fischer-344 rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) at 10–11 weeks of age. Rats were housed at the University of Florida’s Animal Care Services facilities until time of sacrifice at 6 (young) or 24 (old) months of age. A week after arriving at the University of Florida’s facilities, rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 6-month-old sedentary ad libitium (YAL; n = 12), 24-month-old sedentary ad libitium group (OAL; n = 12), 8% caloric restriction (CR) from 11 months-24 months (OCR; n = 12), and 8% CR plus voluntary wheel running (WR) from 11–24 months (OCRWR; n = 12). Studies have shown that rats fed an ad libitum diet have a tendency to run less, but mild CR (8–10%) is substantial enough to prevent the decline in running activity. Therefore, food intake for the two CR groups, OCR and OCRWR, was restricted by 8% below the ad libitum food intake of a separate group of sedentary, age-matched, male Fischer-344 rats that were housed in the same facilities. Although calories were reduced, nutritional balance was maintained for vitamins and trace minerals, as previously described (Kim and others 2008). Throughout the length of the study, food intake in the OCR and OCRWR groups was adjusted weekly based on ad libitum food intake from the previous week. Animals were housed one per cage in a temperature-controlled (20° ± 2.5° C) and light-controlled (12:12 hour light-dark diurnal cycle) room. Sedentary rats were housed under standard conditions in rat cages purchased from Fisher Scientific. OCRWR rats were housed in standard cages equipped with Nalgene Activity Wheels purchased from Fisher Scientific. Activity wheels had a circumference of 1.08 m and were equipped with a magnetic switch and an LCD counter for recording the number of wheel revolutions. The number of revolutions was recorded for each animal on a daily basis. Body weights of all rats were recorded weekly. Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee.2.2. Tissue Preparation Anesthetization of the Fischer-344 rats was accomplished by way of isoflurane inhalation and sacrificed by cardiac puncture. Upon sacrifice, the plantaris muscle was removed, trimmed of excess tissue (tendons and/or fat), rinsed in PBS, blotted dry, weighed and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle samples for histochemical analysis were washed with PBS, blotted dry, weighed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at optimal length in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) solution and stored at −80° C until analysis (Kim and others 2008). Plantaris muscles were a kind gift to our lab from Dr. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh at the University of Florida.2.3. Histochemical Staining Plantaris muscle samples were mounted in tissue freezing medium before being cut at a temperature of −15° C and allowed to air-dry for 30 minutes. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining involved incubating the samples with hematoxylin (VWR, cat # 95057-844) for 4 minutes followed by rinsing with tap water. Differentiation was performed using a 75% ethanol and 0.3% glacial acetic acid solution for 15 minutes. Muscle sections were then incubated in eosin (VWR, cat # 95057-846) for 4 minutes. Dehydration of the samples involved two incubations in 95% ethanol, followed by two subsequent incubations in 100% ethanol. Samples and slides were cleared with xylene prior to mounting the cover slips (Vectamount permanent mounting medium, Vector Laboratories, cat # H-5000). H&E stains were visualized and images captured on an Olympus IX-51 (Olympus Imaging America, Inc.) inverted microscope. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured, recorded, and calibrated against a stage micrometer. Plantaris muscles (n = 6 per group) were analyzed with each fiber CSA in square micrometer units calculated using  ImageJ software against the stage micrometer standard.2.4. Immunohistochemistry To examine protein localization, plantaris muscle sections (n = 6 per group) obtained from the midbelly were serially sectioned at 10 µm thick in a cryostat (Thermo Scientific, Shandon Cryotome FSE) at −15° C and placed onto microscope slides. After acetone fixation, slides were washed in PBS with 0.1% Tween20. Sections were blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 10% goat serum for 15 minutes. After blocking, sections incubated with specific primary antibodies: dystrophin (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat # sc-15376), α-1-syntrophin (1:100, Abcam, cat # ab11187), or nNOS (1:100, Cayman Chemical, cat #160870) for 1 hour in an enclosed chamber at room temperature. After plantaris sections were washed, a 30 minute incubation with the biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:200, Vector Laboratories, cat # BA-1000) secondary antibody in PBS commenced. Cross-sections were washed in PBS before incubating with Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories, cat # PK-61000) for 30 minutes, followed by a 5 min incubation in NovaRed Peroxidase Substrate Solution (Vector Laboratories, cat # SK-4800). Slides were washed and subsequently mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium Hard Set (Vector Laboratories, cat # H-1000). Membrane protein localization for dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS was quantified using an edge filter macro developed for the  ImageJ software program. Samples in each group were analyzed under identical conditions.2.5. Western Blot Analysis Upon sacrifice, plantaris muscles were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to being stored at −80°C until subsequent analysis. Plantaris muscles were pooled together (n = 5 per group), minced, weighed and suspended (15:1 w/v) in ice-cold lysis buffer composed of 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce protease inhibitor, Thermo Scientific, cat # 88666). Muscles were homogenized in a ground glass-on-ground glass mortar and pestle at 4° C. Homogenates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g (4°C). The resulting supernatant was used for protein quantification. Protein concentration of the supernatant fraction was measured using the Bradford protein assay, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, cat # 500-0006). Tissue extracts were subsequently aliquoted and stored at −80°C until western blot analysis. Plantaris tissue extracts (20 µg or 40 µg) along with sample buffer were loaded into wells of 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was conducted at 120 V for ~70 min. Gels were transferred at 100 V for 60 min onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad, cat # 162-0112). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h. After blocking, membranes incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer with the appropriate primary antibody: anti-syntrophin alpha 1 (1:2500, Abcam, cat # ab11187), anti-nNOS (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 610309), anti-MG53/TRIM72 (1:2500, ProSci, cat # 25-812), anti-dysferlin (1:2500, Novacastra, NCL-Hamlet), anti-annexin II (A2) (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 610068), anti-annexin VI (A6) (1:1000, Abcam, cat # ab31206), anti-gp91phox (1:1000, BD Biosciences, cat # 611415), anti-p67phox (1:2500, BD Biosciences, cat # 610913), anti-p47phox (1:750, BD Biosciences, cat # 610355), and anti-Rac1 (1:500, EMD Millipore, cat # 07-1464). Following TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 washes, membranes were incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat # sc-2004 or sc-2005) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After TBS-T washes, proteins were visualized by Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific, cat # 34076) enhanced chemiluminescence detection and developed with the Fuji LAS-3000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (FujiFilm Medical Systems). Quantification was performed using  ImageJ software. Ponceau-S staining (band ~38 kDa mark) was used as a loading control.2.6. Statistical Analysis All data reported here are as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences among YA, OA, OCR, and OCRWR. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was utilized when necessary. Significance level for all tests was set at p < 0.05.3. Results 3.1. Age-related decrease in plantaris fiber CSA is mitigated by lifelong CR and WR As published by Kim et al., average body mass of OAL rats (389.7 g) was not significantly different than YAL rats (374.3 g) (Kim and others 2008). However, mean body mass of the OCRWR rats (341.3 g) was significantly lower than the other three groups – YAL, OAL, and OCR. Relative muscle mass to body mass ratio was not significantly different between OAL and YAL rats (1.67 g/kg v. 1.74 g/kg). In contrast, muscle to body mass ratio was significantly increased in OCRWR rats (1.80 g/kg) when compared to OAL (p<0.01) and OCR (p<0.001) groups (Kim and others 2008). Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in the plantaris muscles was quantified following Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 1 A–C). CSA of muscle fibers is an indicator of muscle atrophy and thus sarcopenia. Compared to YAL fibers (3148 µm2 ± 82.17), each of the old groups were found to have significantly smaller fiber CSA (p<0.0001 OAL; p=0.0025 OCR; p=0.0005 OCRWR). However, both lifelong interventions (CR and CRWR) mitigated the age-related decline in mean muscle fiber CSA, with fiber CSA in OCR (2786 µm2 ± 77.01) and OCRWR (2778 µm2 ± 64.43) groups significantly larger than those found in the OAL group (2264 µm2 ± 49.21; p<0.0001 in each instance) (Fig. 1B). Distribution of plantaris fibers from OAL were mostly under 2500 µm2 (~74% of all fibers), whereas OCR muscles contained approximately 58% and OCRWR muscles only 55% of fibers that were smaller than 2500 µm2 (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these findings indicate that lifelong CR and CRWR limit the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and fiber CSA, thus limiting the decline in muscle function. Fig. 1.

Lifelong CR and WR attenuated disruption of sarcolemmal localized DGC proteins We examined the localization of three key DGC proteins: dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS. These DGC proteins are normally localized near the sarcolemma. Dystrophin, which normally binds to the transmembrane protein β-dystroglycan, as well as α-syntrophin and dystrobrevin, is tightly associated with the sarcolemma. nNOSµ is bound to α- or β-syntrophin in healthy, skeletal muscle, but may detach during Duchenne and other muscular dystrophies and disuse (Brenman and others 1995; Finanger Hedderick and others 2011; Suzuki and others 2007). Aging did not have an effect on the sarcolemmal content of dystrophin in the plantaris muscle fibers (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, CR and WR interventions contained significantly greater levels of sarcolemmal-localized dystrophin compared to the OAL fibers (+18.4%, p=0.0002 OCR and +24.4%, p<0.0001 OCRWR compared to OAL; Fig. 2A and B). In addition, OCR and OCRWR fibers had significantly greater sarcolemmal dystrophin than YAL (+17% OCR, p=0.0012 and +22.9%, p<0.0001 OCRWR compared to YAL; Fig. 2A and B). Although the overall sarcolemmal content of dystrophin between YAL and OAL was not deemed significantly different, it was apparent that a discontinuous sarcolemmal pattern existed for the OAL fibers (Fig. 2A). This was an effect that was ameliorated by the lifelong interventions of CR and CRWR, with OCRWR dystrophin immunostaining appearing very similar in consistency to that of the YAL plantaris fibers (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2.

Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Significance level was set a p < 0.05. (a) Indicates significant difference from YAL group; (b) Indicates significant difference from OAL group. Dystrophin and α-syntrophin images were taken at 20× magnification (scale bar set at 50 µm) and nNOS images were taken at 16× magnification (scale bar set at 100 µm). Ponceau S Red stain (GAPDH – 38 kDa mark) used as a loading control for western blots.As mentioned above, α-syntrophin binds to dystrophin and is commonly found near the sarcolemma. In aged plantaris muscle fibers, α-syntrophin was largely disassociated from the sarcolemma (Fig 2A). However, CR and CRWR led to significant increases in sarcolemmal localized α-syntrophin compared to the ad-libitum fed groups, with OCR having 25.8% more than OAL and 17% more than YAL (p<0.0001 for OAL v. OCR and OCRWR; Fig. 2A and B), while OCRWR contained 31.2% more than OAL and 22.7% more than YAL (p<0.0001 for YAL v. OCR and OCRWR; Fig. 2A and B). As can be seen in Fig. 2A, continuity of α-syntrophin near the membrane is best preserved with the combination of WR with CR. Overall protein content of α-syntrophin was found to be significantly higher in the OAL plantaris fibers compared to YAL (p = 0.01), whereas the OCR and OCRWR content was not deemed significantly higher than YAL or significantly lower than OAL (Fig. 2C). The mu splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) is normally found bound to α-syntrophin and dystrobrevin and indirectly to dystrophin. In healthy muscle nNOS is involved in several signaling events related to regulation of muscle mass, force generation and susceptibility to fatigue (Brenman and others 1995; Kobayashi and others 2008; Percival and others 2008). Protein concentration of nNOS (relative to ponceau red staining) was not found to be significantly different between YAL and OAL (Fig. 2C and D). Although CR and CRWR interventions did not affect nNOS protein abundance significantly, compared to OAL, OCRWR trended toward a significant increase with a p-value of 0.08 (+26% compared to OAL, Fig. 2D). Even though nNOS protein content was not found to be significantly different across groups, nNOS localization was altered with aging (Fig. 2A and B). Aging resulted in a significant decrease of sarcolemmal localized nNOS when comparing YAL to OAL plantaris fibers (−59%, p<0.0001 OAL compared to YAL, Fig. 2B). Lifelong CR and the addition of WR mitigated the mislocalization of nNOS, with 94.4% more in the OCR (p <0.0001) and 100.7% more sarcolemmal nNOS in the OCRWR (p <0.0001) compared to OAL (Fig. 2B). However, the interventions were not able to completely maintain the YAL sarcolemmal phenotype.3.3. Sedentary, ad-libitum aging is associated with dramatic increases in membrane repair proteins As indicated by previous studies (Leiter and others 2012; Rice and others 2006) and suggested by our DGC findings, sarcolemmal damage occurs with sedentary, ad libitum aging. To examine this further, we investigated how aging as well as lifelong diet and exercise interventions, on membrane-repair machinery in aged muscle fibers. We chose to measure the protein content of four proteins that have been strongly tied to membrane repair processes: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2. Membrane damage is normally followed by a repair response to restore integrity to the membrane and maintain homeostasis. Our observations indicate that there is significant increase in MG53 (p < 0.0001), dysferlin (p < 0.0001), annexin A6 (p < 0.0001) and annexin A2 (p = 0.004) abundance in the OAL rats compared to YAL (Fig. 3). The lifelong intervention of CR+WR was capable of maintaining at or near control YAL levels of MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2 (Fig. 3A and B). Plantaris muscles from OCR rats were found to contain significantly more dysferlin (p = 0.011) than OCRWR, but significantly less than OAL (p = 0.0005). Old CR muscles also contained significantly less annexin A6 (p < 0.0001) than OAL, but significantly more than YAL (p = 0.026) and OCRWR (p = 0.0003). Interestingly, the exercised group (OCRWR) contained the lowest levels of repair proteins out of the four groups (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3.

Ponceau S Red stain (GAPDH – 38 kDa mark) was used as a loading control for western blots.3.4. Lifelong CR and WR ameliorate the age-related reduction in Nox2 abundance Presently, the level of involvement that Nox2 plays during the sarcopenic process remains unclear, and thus investigation of Nox2 isoforms in the aging plantaris and the effects of lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running were investigated. In the present study, we found that aging was associated with a reduced abundance of Nox2 subunits (Fig. 4A and B). There was a trend for an age-related decrease (−45%) in the transmembrane catalytic subunit, gp91phox, comparing YAL to OAL (p=0.096; Fig. 4B). Regulatory cytosolic subunits, p47phox and p67phox, displayed a significant age-related reduction in protein content (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively; Fig. 4B). No significant difference was observed between YAL and OAL in the levels of the microtubule-associated Nox2 subunit Rac-1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, gp91phox, p67phox, and p47phox were expressed at significantly higher protein levels in the OCR compared to OAL plantaris (Fig. 4B). Lifelong CR+WR muscles trended toward a significant increase in levels of gp91phox (+81.1%, p=0.096) and reached significant increases in protein abundance of p67phox (+70.9%, p = 0.0009) and p47phox (+128.4%, p = 0.0002) compared to OAL (Fig. 4B). Overall, each Nox2 subunit exhibited a similar trend of an age-related decrease. With the exception of p67phox, which was significantly higher in the OCR than YAL group (p=0.03), Nox2 subunits in OCR and OCRWR muscle were not significantly different than YAL. Fig. 4.

Discussion In the current study, we report that lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and CR plus lifelong voluntary wheel running (WR) are interventions capable of partially preventing the age-associated decrease in plantaris muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Additionally, lifelong CR and CRWR offered protection against age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment, which may aid in maintenance of skeletal muscle functionality and overall health. We observed that sedentary aging led to discontinuous sarcolemmal patterning of key DGC proteins, such as dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS, an effect that was prevented by the addition of lifelong CR and CRWR. Inconsistent sarcolemmal patterning of DGC proteins is indicative of reduced membrane integrity; therefore, we examined proteins involved in membrane repair. Sedentary, ad libitum aging (OAL) had increased abundance of membrane repair proteins: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6 and annexin A2. In order to elucidate the potential role of membrane-generated oxidative stress in the age-related reduction in membrane integrity, we sought to determine the role of the membrane-bound superoxide producing NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) complex. We identified several crucial Nox2 protein subunits that were significantly reduced with sedentary aging (OAL), which is prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Thus, our data indicates that sedentary, ad-libitum aging is associated with reduced sarcolemmal integrity, increased sarcolemmal damage, altered membrane redox environment, all of which are likely associated with the progression of sarcopenia. Lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were capable of mitigating the negative age-related alterations, consequently providing a myofiber environment conducive for better overall muscle health and function. A detailed discussion of our major findings follows. 4.1. Effect of CR and WR on muscle fiber atrophy Previous studies showed that sarcopenia can be attenuated by dietary restriction (Hepple and others 2008; McKiernan and others 2004) and/or exercise (Kim and others 2008; Pasini and others 2012). While Wohlgemuth and colleagues did not find significantly increased muscle to body mass ratios in the old CR or old CR + exercise rats compared to OAL (Wohlgemuth and others 2010), our lab previously showed that lifelong dietary restriction + exercise resulted in a muscle : body mass that was significantly increased compared to sedentary, ad-libitum fed, aged rats (Kim and others 2008). Our previous findings exhibited an age-related decrease in plantaris fiber CSA, an effect prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR (Kim and others 2008). Here, we have observed the partial protection of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) by lifelong mild (8%) CR and CR plus WR (Fig 1). The present study demonstrated a protective effect of lifelong CR and WR + CR on plantaris fiber cross-sectional area compared with lifelong, sedentary rats fed ad libitum. Our lab noted that lifelong CR and CRWR prevented the increase in extramyocyte space and connective tissue exhibited in sedentary aged rats (Kim and others 2008). However, unlike Kim et al. (Kim and others 2008), in the present study the plantaris fiber CSA in OCR and OCRWR rats remained significantly smaller than YAL. If muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased and fiber number is reduced with aging due to apoptosis (Marzetti and others 2008), then extracellular matrix of connective tissue and fat must compromise a larger proportion of aging muscle mass (Kim and others 2008). This is consistent with a reduction in muscle quality (force per cross-sectional area) with progressive age (Brooks and Faulkner 1994; Thompson 2009).4.2. Protection by CR and CRWR against DGC alterations in aged plantaris muscle The costameric DGC acts as a mechanosensitive scaffold of proteins that are responsible for force transmission, structural integrity of the cell, and transmission of cellular signaling processes from the extracellular environment (Grounds and others 2005; Gumerson and Michele 2011). Loss of, or decreased expression of, DGC proteins signifies a decrease in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma and leads to myofiber loss (Davies and Nowak 2006; Rice and others 2006). Here, we report a discontinuity of membrane-associated dystrophin with aging, but not overall expression, and a dissociation of α-syntrophin was noted (Fig. 2). This discontinuity was mitigated by the long-term interventions of CR and CRWR. Moreover, the lifelong CR and CRWR interventions not only proved to be effective at maintaining the sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin and α-syntrophin, but also resulted in increased sarcolemmal content of the DGC proteins, concomitant with larger muscle fiber size than OAL. Recently, Ramaswamy et al. identified the mechanical consequences of age-related disruption in the DGC, as manifested as a roughly 50% loss of lateral force transmission, and thus the integrity of the parallel elastic element in both rats and mice (Ramaswamy and others 2011). Very old rats (34–35 months of age) displayed impaired lateral transmission of force, there was a concomitant discontinuity in dystrophin (Ramaswamy and others 2011). When coupled with the current data that illustrate a substantial disruption of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOSµ), perturbations in DGC-ECM interface with aging could compromise myofiber structural integrity. For example, Rice et al. showed that aging led discontinuous positive staining on the sarcolemma for dystrophin, while membrane content increased in the EDL of 36 month old rats (Rice and others 2006). Indeed, dystrophin was absent from discrete sections of sarcolemma (Rice and others 2006) similar to the plantaris muscles from the sedentary, ad-libitum aged (OAL) group. When a discontinuous and patchy membrane accumulation of dystrophin exists, there is a reduction in membrane and muscle fiber integrity (Faulkner and others 1995). Bound to dystrophin, α-Syntrophin is a DGC protein that binds to and attaches nNOSµ to the DGC. We found a significant increase in total α-syntrophin in the OAL compared to YAL plantaris muscles (Fig. 2). Similar to the dystrophin data from Rice et al. (Rice and others 2006), an increase in α-syntrophin protein content was accompanied by discontinuous disruption of sarcolemmal α-syntrophin in the OAL group (Fig 2). Furthermore, mice lacking dystrophin are unable to localize α-syntrophin to the sarcolemma (Brenman and others 1995; Grounds and others 2005), consistent with shared poor linkages by costameres and lateral force generation (Ramaswamy and others 2011). Membrane-associated α-syntrophin may also regulate protein turnover and remodeling, where the laminin – β-dystroglycan interaction permits sarcolemmal-localized α-syntrophin mediated phosphorylation of Akt (Zhou and others 2007). The mu splice variant of nNOS (nNOSµ) is normally bound to α-syntrophin and thus anchored near the sarcolemma. nNOSµ has been identified as a key signaling protein that regulates muscle mass in response to changes in loading, augments force production, and reduces muscular fatigue (Kobayashi and others 2008; Percival and others 2008; Percival and others 2010). Here lifelong CRWR resulted in a non-significant (p = 0.08) increase of total nNOS compared to sedentary, ad-libitum aging, and was not impacted by aging. Sarcolemmal nNOS was drastically mislocalized in aged plantaris muscle fibers, where it was observed predominately in the sarcoplasm. Previously, our group (Lawler and others 2014) and Suzuki et al. (Suzuki and others 2007) found that mechanical unloading and denervation cause translocation of nNOSµ away from the sarcolemma. Mislocalization of nNOS is also noted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Brenman and others 1995) and other types of neuromuscular disorders (Finanger Hedderick and others 2011), further emphasizing the physiological importance of the protein for proper muscle function to occur. The current study identified a loss of sarcolemmal, but not overall nNOS. Recent aging literature indicates that nNOS location, muscle, and physical activity have impacted age-related changes. We previously observed that constitutive NOS activity is reduced by aging (Song and others 2009). Overall nNOS protein levels were reduced in the soleus, but not the rat gastrocnemius. Pearson et al. (Pearson and others 2015) did not find a reduction in total nNOS protein abundance from old C57Bl/6 mice. In contrast, Samengo et al., showed a 41% decline of nNOSµ expression levels in the quadricep muscles of 2 year old mice along with a concomitant decrease in protein content (Samengo and others 2012). In our study, CR and CRWR, proved to be effective at maintaining sarcolemmal nNOS compared to OAL fibers (Fig. 2). Previously, we found that exercise training increased nNOS protein expression in both muscles (Song and others 2009). Lieter et al. (2012) found that cytoplasmic localization of nNOS is greater in quadriceps of 19.5 month old mice vs. young mice, which could exacerbate proteolysis and atrophy (Suzuki and others 2007). However, 6 weeks of administration of an NO-donor drug and 3 weeks of exercise in 18 month old mice prevented mislocalization of nNOS, concomitant with muscle hypertrophy (Leiter and others 2012). Consistently, loss of sarcolemmal nNOS was causal in skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area during disuse (Lawler and others 2014; Suzuki and others 2007). The physiological importance of DGC localization of nNOSµ for healthy regulation of skeletal muscle size, damage, and repair is substantial. Therefore, lifelong CR and CRWR preserves a more continuous membrane patterning of key DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS), which could improve membrane and mechano-signaling, and protect against sarcopenia.4.3. Effect of aging on sarcolemmal repair Given that aging was associated with a discontinuous loss of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOS) from the sarcolemma, we postulate that aging may be conferring a “mild dystrophic phenotype” on skeletal muscle. Since the DGC offers stability to the sarcolemma (Blake and others 2002), a weakened DGC could compromise sarcolemmal integrity and increase the risk of membrane leakage and fiber damage (Petrof and others 1993). Indeed, loss of sarcolemmal dystrophin results in muscle fibers that are more prone to contraction-induced injury, due to impaired ability of lateral force transference from the Z-disc through the costameres into the ECM (Lovering and De Deyne 2004). When dystrophin is lost, shear forces are elevated which can trigger ROS and Ca2+ mediated damage to the muscle fiber with repeated eccentric contractions (Lovering and De Deyne 2004). Compromised DGC leads to uncontrolled damage-repair cycling, fiber death, and eventual replacement with fibrotic tissue (Mann and others 2011; Serrano and others 2011). Therefore, an intact plasma membrane environment and efficient repair of the cell membrane are crucial to maintenance of cellular homeostasis. When stressed by mechanical and biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) perturbations, a cadre of membrane repair proteins guide vacuole sequestration, repair, and patching of damaged phospholipid membranes. Specifically, MG53, dysferlin, and annexin A6 are sequestered to membrane lesions to repair and reseal damaged sarcolemma, followed by recruitment of annexins A2 and A1 to complete scaffolding of the membrane patch. In this coordinated membrane repair, MG53 is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2 (Cai and others 2009; Roostalu and Strahle 2012). Given that old sedentary, fed ad libitum expressed high levels of membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, annexin A2) (Fig. 3), we postulate that there is an enhanced requirement for phospholipid membrane repair in aging skeletal muscle. Lifelong exercise + mild caloric restriction (diet) maintained membrane repair proteins near control (YAL) levels, suggesting protection against cell membrane damage and thus the need for heightened repair (Fig. 3). Interestingly, CR alone was unable to maintain membrane repair proteins at YAL levels, particularly for annexin A6 (Fig. 3). Thus chronic exercise is required to better protect the environment of the aging sarcolemma. Indeed, we previously noted (Kim and others 2008) that lifelong wheel running plus mild CR abrogated age-related elevation of total hydroperoxides; while caloric restriction alone did not prevent age-related elevation of lipid hydroperoxides. Cagliani et al. observed annexin A1 and A2 levels were overexpressed in parallel in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy characterized by high levels of membrane damage and lipid peroxidation (Cagliani and others 2005). Thus lipid peroxidation and upregulation of membrane repair proteins are characteristics shared by aging and dystrophic muscle. In contrast, lifelong wheel running mitigated age-associated upregulation of MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2 (Fig. 3). Given that Alloush et al. reported 8 weeks of treadmill exercise training in C57Bl/6 mice had no effect upon three repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, caveolin-3) in the soleus muscle, long-term physical activity would then logically be a preservation effect. Thus we would argue that habitual exercise maintains long-term homeostasis of the lipid membrane environment, linked to preservation of the DGC, and reduction of sarcopenia.4.4. Nox2 and aging muscle Oxidative stress increases during the aging process in skeletal muscle, as with most tissues. (Ji and others 1998; Kim and others 2008). High levels of oxidative stress have been linked to sarcopenia: muscle fiber CSA, muscular strength, and performance (Bejma and Ji 1999; Kim and others 2008). Sources of ROS in skeletal muscle include the mitochondrial electron transport chain, prostaglandin metabolism, xanthine oxidase, and NADPH oxidases (Nox). Nox2 is a multi-protein enzyme complex that consists of membrane-bound catalytic gp91phox and regulatory p22phox, and regulatory cytosolic subunits: p47phox, p67phox, and the small-GTPase Rac1. Nox2 has been found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Xia and others 2003), t-tubules (Espinosa and others 2006), and the sarcolemma (Javeshghani and others 2002). Nox2 is the most likely source of O2•− in skeletal muscle during contraction and stretch of healthy skeletal muscles, and not mitochondria (Sakellariou and others 2013). However, Nox2 becomes hyper-responsive to stretch in dystrophic mice, contributing to excessive Ca(2+) entry into the fibers and fueling debilitating myopathy (Whitehead and others 2010). Furthermore, Nox2 is elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to disuse atrophy (Lawler and others 2014). Surprisingly, we found that ad libitum, sedentary aged (OAL) rats contained significantly lower protein levels of cytosolic Nox2 subunits: p67phox and p47phox. In addition, the microtubule-associated subunit Rac1 exhibited a similar trend downward with age. Recently, Barrientos et al. found that p47phox displayed a non-significant downward trend with age (p=0.08) (Barrientos and others 2015), while Ryan and colleagues reported that total NADPH oxidase activity in the gastrocnemius was unaltered by age, following protein trends for the Nox4 isoform (Ryan and others 2010). Therefore, it is possible age-related changes in Nox2 expression may vary with subcellular localization, species, and independent of Nox4 protein expression. We postulate that the aging membrane environment may be unsuitable for normal response of Nox2 to contractions. Whereas lifelong physical activity may act to preserve normal Nox2 complex structure via maintaining a healthy membrane environmental phenotype. Here we found that lifelong wheel running maintained high abundance of gp91phox and p47phox (Fig. 4). Thus we argue that inducibility of the Nox2 complex by exercise is maintained in healthy aging when exercise is chronic or habitual. Given that cellular oxidative stress is increased in aging skeletal muscle, (Lawler and others 2014; Sakellariou and others 2014; Whitehead and others 2010), it can be inferred that the sources independent of Nox2 may drive age-related oxidative stress. In young healthy muscle, Nox2 participates in contractile – induced cell signaling (Khairallah and others 2012; Sakellariou and others 2013) and insulin signaling (Contreras-Ferrat and others 2014; Espinosa and others 2009). However, overproduction of Nox2 contributes to pathology with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Khairallah and others 2012; Whitehead and others 2010), hypertension (Frey and others 2009), and possible disuse (Lawler and others 2014). In contrast, baseline ROS released from mitochondria are elevated with Type II diabetes and aging (Anderson and others 2009; Janssen-Heininger and others 2008). Therefore, the yin-yang relationship between Nox2 and mitochondria may be substantially disrupted with aging, yet protected by lifelong diet and exercise interventions. Clearly, additional investigations are necessary to unravel this intriguing mystery.4.5. Limitations Experimental design and tissue limitation did not allow sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 and repair proteins or membrane damage, other than previous morphological histology (Kim and others 2008). Unfortunately, we were unable to inject the rats with Evans blue dye to determine damage and necrosis since that could have interfered with other experimental objectives. Due to a limited amount of tissue reserved for histochemical analysis, we were also unable to stain the plantaris muscles with IgG in an effort to examine tissue damage. These are unfortunate short-comings that should definitely be addressed in future studies in order to provide more details and connections as to the sarcolemmal integrity issues that appear to be occurring in aged animals. However, we were able to show that proteins that are normally associated with membrane repair were elevated in OAL muscle. Another drawback is that we only used male rats, leaving the question of potential sex-related differences unanswered. In addition, tissue mass and assay demands limited our ability to isolate and analyze mitochondrial ROS. Since the experimental design did not call for a lifelong WR only exercise group because 8% CR is needed to encourage voluntary lifelong wheel running activity, we were unable to differentiate the effects of WR from the effects of CR. We have previously shown that wheel running may have additive or synergistic protection against age-related changes in morphology and cell signaling (Kim and others 2008).5. Conclusions In summary, aging was associated with a disruption of the membrane environment, affecting sarcolemmal expression of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex proteins, membrane repair proteins, and Nox2 subunits. Furthermore, age-related perturbations in DGC, membrane repair proteins, and Nox2 subunits were consistently mitigated by lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running. These highly novel findings in protective cell signaling conferred lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary exercise were also linked to significant abrogation of aging-associated reduction in relative muscle weight and CSA. Therefore, lifelong CR and WR may prevent age-related impairment of overall muscle quality and sarcopenia, which could yield better quality of life and resistance to chronic disease and frailty.Highlights. Lifelong CR and WR maintains continuous sarcolemmal DGC proteins compared to OAL. Age-related increase in membrane-repair proteins is mitigated by OCR and OCRWR. Age-induced reduction of Nox2 subunits was prevented by OCR and OCRWR.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Disuse and mechanical unloading that occur during spaceflight can result in detrimental skeletal muscle atrophy and defects in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and function. Specifically, spaceflight and microgravity result in decreased muscle fiber size and altered activity of several metabolic enzymes in the soleus and tibialis muscles [1]. Within fast-twitch fibers, space flight decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity in the subsarcolemmal region, while slow-twitch fibers experienced altered distribution of succinate dehydrogenase activity across the entire fiber [2]. Additionally, simulated microgravity increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple cell types [3,4] and elevated pro-inflammatory signaling [5,6]. Sources of ROS that have been demonstrated to contribute to unloading-induced muscle atrophy include the mitochondria [7] and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) [8,9]. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to skeletal muscle wasting with denervation [10,11], unloading [7], and cachexia [12,13,14]. Thus, there is a glaring need for preventative measures to maintain skeletal muscle health in astronauts enduring microgravity during their journeys to space. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that respond to alterations in mechanical loading [15]. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insufficient levels of stress proteins are proposed cellular mechanisms by which unloading causes pathology and impairment in musculoskeletal function. Mitochondrial ROS also appears to contribute to unloading-induced atrophy [7]. Mitochondria have many essential cellular roles, including mitochondria’s well known, essential function in energy production. Oxidative energy production in mitochondria is accomplished through enzymatic pathways in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), as well as substrate flux through the ETC, are important markers of metabolism adversely affected by unloading and spaceflight [16,17]. In addition, ROS production by electron leakage from the ETC can contribute to elevated oxidative stress during unloading [7,18]. Thus, there is current thought that preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of ROS leakage could mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight and disuse [14,19]. Recent evidence has suggested that a pathway involving AMP kinase (AMPK) and siruitin-1 (SIRT1) can be instrumental not only in mitochondrial biogenesis [20,21], but also in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass [22]. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase that influences the activity of several enzymes and transcriptional regulators [23,24,25,26]. SIRT1 mediates responses to inflammatory, metabolic, and oxidative stressors. Specifically, SIRT1 moderates mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) [27,28,29]. Previous studies have identified several beneficial effects of SIRT1 activation on musculoskeletal and systemic health via pharmacological treatments, including improved endurance [30,31]. SIRT1 is also involved in skeletal muscle repair [22] and resveratrol’s anti-atrophic effects in aging skeletal muscle occur via SIRT1 [32]. Loss of SIRT1 appears to play a role in food depravation-induced muscle atrophy [33]. However, the potential mitigating role of SIRT1 in unloading-induced mitochondrial function and muscle atrophy is poorly understood. SRT2104 is a small molecule SIRT1 agonist that induces SIRT1 and downstream signaling [34]. For example, SIRT1 attenuated age-induced loss of muscle mass in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles [31]. In addition, SRT2104 treatment reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and elevated PGC-1α during hindlimb unloading in old mice [31]. Together, these results suggest SRT2104 could improve mitochondrial function and protect against muscle wasting. However, the impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ROS production has not been determined with mechanical unloading. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SRT2104 would rescue mechanical unloading-induced impairments in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, modulate redox responses, and protect skeletal muscle (e.g., soleus, gastrocnemius) mass. Fischer-344 rats were divided into the following conditions: ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 10 days (HU), and hindlimb unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT).",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animal Housing and Management Four-month-old male Fisher-344 (F344) rats, a common rodent model for mechanical unloading and spaceflight, were purchased from Envigo (F344 rats, Envigo RMS, LLC, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and used in this study. Phenotypic muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shifts from slow to fast-twitch in F344 rats are similar to humans [40]. Rats were kept in a 12/12 h daylight cycle, temperature-controlled room, and provided chow and water ad libitum. Animal care met all federal stipulations per  statutes (NRC Guide for Care and Use of lab animals, 8th Edition, 2011) and was consistent with the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy, as well as the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 4.2. Experimental Design and Hindlimb Unloading Fisher-344 rats were divided into three groups: ambulatory controls (CON, n = 6), hindlimb-unloaded for 10 days (HU, n = 6), and hindlimb-unloaded + 25 mg/kg/day (I.P. injection) SRT2104 (SIRT, n = 4). SRT2104 was purchased from MedChemExpress (Sirt1 activator: CAS No. 1093403-33-8, Cat No. HY-15262, MedChemExpress, Brunswick Township, NJ, USA). Hindlimb unloading in rodents was conducted with an adaptation of the technique previously described by our laboratory [8,9]. We employed a hindlimb harness to produce unloading, as previously described by Mortreux (2020) [43]. The copper wire harness was overfitted with elastic tubing and moleskin as a pliable cushion. The harness was hoisted using a stainless-steel chain attached to a fishing tackle swivel, which was allowed to move freely on a lubricated brass rod. The hindlimb harness allowed rodents to maneuver around the cage with their hindlimb paws just above the cage bedding. Hindlimb unloading replicates the physiological effects of bedrest and spaceflight [8,9]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg). To reverse the anesthetic effect of xylazine, 1 mg for every 10 mg xylazine of Atipamezole (5 mg/mL Conc.) was injected IP. Rats were then fitted with a flexible harness attached to a crosswire through a swivel that allowed ambulation around the cage and free access to food and water. Rats were then elevated at a spinal angle of 40° so that hindfeet were approximately 1 cm off the cage floor. At the end of the 10-day hindlimb unloading period, rats from all groups were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg). 4.3. Sample Collection After animal euthanization, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected, cleaned in PBS, and weighed. Both the soleus and the red gastrocnemius muscles are considered highly oxidative, with more mitochondria content [44,45,46]. Tissues were aliquoted and stored in three ways: (1) flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until mitochondrial enzyme and antioxidant activity analyses; (2) placed directly into 1 mL ice-cold mitochondrial preservation solution (BIOPS; 10 mM Ca-EGTA buffer, 0.1 µM free calcium, 20 mM imidazole, 20 mM taurine, 50 mM K-MES, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 6.56 mM MgCl2, 5.77 mM ATP, and 15 mM phosphocreatine; pH 7.1) and stored on ice for same day analysis of mitochondrial capacities; and (3) placed in 1mL ice-cold 1X PBS 1 mM EGTA for same-day mitochondrial isolation and analysis of H2O2 production. The left soleus was used for mitochondrial analyses, while the right soleus was used for quantification of H2O2 production. The left gastrocnemius was aliquoted and used for all analyses. 4.4. Mitochondrial Enzyme Activities Citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities were determined as measures of mitochondrial volume density and function, respectively, using kinetic colorimetry, as previously described [47,48]. Frozen muscle tissue was cryopulverized (Spectrum™ Bessman Tissue Pulverizer; Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) and then sonicated 3 times for 3 s each in chilled sucrose homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) with 1 part 5% detergent (n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside; Sigma D4641). Samples were centrifuged at 11,000× g for 3 min at 0 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C for future analysis. Enzyme activities were determined using a microplate reader (Synergy H1; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Citrate synthase activity was determined by measuring the linear rate of reaction of free CoA-SH with DTNB at 412 nm at 37 °C and CCO activity determined by measuring the linear rate of oxidation of fully reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm at 37 °C. Both assays utilized 80-fold diluted muscle homogenate and were analyzed in duplicate. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for CS activity were 4.3% and 1.9%, respectively. Intra-assay and inter-assay CVs for CCO activity were 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Each enzyme activity was then normalized to total protein content, which was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was further normalized to CS activity (intrinsic), giving a measure of function per mitochondria in the sample [36]. 4.5. High-Resolution Respirometry High-resolution respirometry was used to measure mitochondrial capacities. All muscle samples were analyzed within 12 h of collection and remained submerged in ice-cold BIOPS solution on ice or at 4 °C until analysis between collection and analysis. Immediately prior to analysis, samples were permeabilized, as described previously [47]. Permeabilized fibers were then rinsed in mitochondrial respiration solution (Mir05; 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM potassium lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2∙6H2O, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 1 g/L BSA, pH 7.1) on a plate rocker for 10 min at 4 °C. Approximately 1.5 to 2.5 mg (wet weight) of rinsed fibers were then immediately added to each chamber of an Oroboros Oxygraph-2k (O2k; Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria), containing MiR06 (MiR05 + 280 U/mL catalase) and 20 mM creatine. Chambers were maintained at 37 °C and in hyperoxic conditions (200 to 650 µM O2) through addition of 200 mM H2O2. The previously described [49] substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration protocol for this study was as follows: (1) complex I substrates, pyruvate (5 mM), and malate (1 mM) to determine nonphosphorylating proton leak (LEAK); (2) adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 2.5 mM), to quantify complex I-supported P (PCI); (3) glutamate (10 mM), an additional complex I substrate (PCIG); (4) cytochrome c (10 µM), to measure integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane; (5) the complex II substrate, succinate (10 mM), to measure maximal coupled P (PCI+II); (6) uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 0.5 µM steps), to attain maximal noncoupled E (ECI+II); (7) a complex I inhibitor, rotenone (0.5µM), to measure complex II-supported E (ECII); and (8) a complex III inhibitor, antimycin A (2.5 µM), to quantify non-mitochondrial residual O2 consumption. All data were normalized to residual O2 consumption. Samples were re-analyzed if respiration increased greater than 10%, following the addition of exogenous cytochrome c (step 4 in protocol listed above). Respiration data are presented either relative to tissue weight (integrative), CS activity (mitochondrial volume density; intrinsic), or as a ratio of the measure of interest to ECI+II (flux control ratio, FCR). 4.6. Reactive Oxygen Species Fat and connective tissue were mechanically removed, and the muscle was minced into fine pieces then incubated in 0.025% trypsin (MilliporeSigma cat#T4799, Burlington, NJ, USA) and mitochondria were isolated, as previously described [50]. Samples were homogenized in mitochondrial isolation medium (MIM: 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.1) containing 1 mg/mL BSA, on ice [51]. Muscle homogenates were subjected to a first centrifugation step (800× g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was again centrifuged (12,000× g, 10 min, 4 °C). The final pellet (isolated mitochondria) was resuspended in 150 µL MIM, and protein quantification was assessed using the Coomasie Bradford Protein assay (Thermo Scientific). H2O2 production and concentration were quantified fluorometrically using a commercially available kit (AmplexRed, Catalog #A22188, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 4.7. Antioxidant Enzyme Activities Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured using commercially available kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Cryopulverized muscle tissue was homogenized in extraction buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000× g for 2 min at 0 °C, as previously described [51]. Supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. For SOD, an 80-fold dilution of the homogenate diluted 1:5 in provided sample buffer was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate with an intra-assay CV of 4%. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. For GPx, a 40-fold dilution of the homogenate was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate, with an intra-assay CV of 3%. Both activities were normalized to protein content, determined using the Coomassie Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). 4.8. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS v.9.4 with the fixed effect of treatment and animal within treatment as a random effect. Muscles were analyzed separately. All data are expressed as estimates of least squares means ± SEM. Significance was declared when p ≤ 0.05 and trends when 0.05 ≤ p ≤ 0.1.",

Mitochondrial Enzyme Activities Citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities were quantified in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles of all rats as indicators of mitochondrial volume density and function, respectively [35,36]. Within the soleus muscle, CS activity, as well as integrative (relative to mg protein) and intrinsic (relative to CS activity) CCO activities, were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Figure 1A,C,E). Within the gastrocnemius muscle, CS activity and integrative CCO activity were similarly unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Figure 1B,D). However, intrinsic CCO activity was lesser in HU rats compared to CON (p = 0.006) and SIRT rats (p = 0.0002; Figure 1F). Figure 1.

High Resolution Respirometry Oxidative phosphorylation (P) and electron transfer (E) capacities were determined via high-resolution respirometry. Respiration data are presented either as integrative (relative to tissue wet weight), intrinsic (relative to CS activity; mitochondrial volume density), or as a ratio of the measure of interest to maximal electron transfer capacity (flux control ratio; FCR). Within the soleus muscle, integrative and intrinsic capacities and FCRs were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Supplementary Figures S1–S3). Conversely, within the gastrocnemius muscle, integrative mitochondrial proton LEAK, a dissipative respiratory state not resulting in biochemical work, was lesser in SIRT rats than HU (p = 0.002) or CON rats (p = 0.03; Figure 2A). Integrative capacities of oxidative phosphorylation supported by complex I (PCI and PCIG), maximal coupled oxidative phosphorylation (PCI+II), maximal noncoupled electron transfer (ECI+II), and electron transfer supported by complex II only (ECII) were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Within the gastrocnemius muscle, intrinsic ECI+II was lesser in HU rats than CON (p = 0.04), but there was no difference between HU and SIRT rats (Figure 3E). Intrinsic LEAK, PCI, PCI+II, and ECII were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment. Figure 3.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Also within the gastrocnemius, the contribution of LEAK to maximal electron transfer (flux control ratio; FCRLEAK) was greater in HU rats than CON (p = 0.03) or SIRT rats (p = 0.002; Figure 4A). Additionally, the FCR for oxidative phosphorylation supported by complex I (FCRPCI) was lesser in CON rats than HU rats (p = 0.01), but it was not different between CON and SIRT rats. Further, the FCR when glutamate was added as an additional complex I substrate (FCRPCIG) was lesser in both CON and SIRT rats compared to HU rats (p ≤ 0.005). However, the FCR for maximal coupled oxidative phosphorylation (FCRPCI+II) and noncoupled electron transfer supported by complex II only (FCRECII) were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05). 2.3. Reactive Oxygen Species Within the soleus muscle, the rate of production of the ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in isolated mitochondria was greater in SIRT rats compared to CON (p < 0.0001) and HU rats (p = 0.0007; Figure 5B). Similarly, SIRT rats had the greatest H2O2 concentrations (vs. HU: p = 0.0005; vs. CON: p < 0.0001), with HU having intermediate concentrations, and CON rats having the lowest H2O2 concentrations (vs. HU: p = 0.02; Figure 5D).

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Similarly, within the gastrocnemius muscle, H2O2 production was greater in SIRT rats than CON (p = 0.004) and HU rats (p = 0.003; Figure 5A). Additionally, H2O2 concentration tended to be greater in HU than CON rats (p = 0.08), while SIRT rats had greater H2O2 concentration than either CON (p = 0.003) or HU rats (p = 0.01; Figure 5C). 2.4. Antioxidant Enzyme Activities Due to a lack of sample volume, antioxidant enzyme activities were only investigated in the gastrocnemius muscle. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was greater in HU (p = 0.004) and SIRT (p = 0.009) rats compared to CON, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity did not differ between treatment groups (Figure 6).

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05). 2.5. Muscle Weights The right soleus and left gastrocnemius muscles were lesser in weight in HU rats compared CON (p ≤ 0.0002) rats, and SIRT was lesser than CON (p ≤ 0.03) (Figure 7). The right soleus was lesser weight in HU rats compared to SIRT (p = 0.0002), and the left gastrocnemius tended to be lesser in weight in HU rats compared to SIRT (p = 0.07).

    "discussion": "3. Discussion The primary findings of this study are as follows (1) The SIRT1 agonist SRT2104 reduced integrative proton leak in unloaded gastrocnemius muscles. (2) SRT2104 increased cytochrome c oxidase activity compared to the unloaded gastrocnemius, while citrate synthase trended higher in the SIRT soleus. (3) Intrinsic O2 flux was increased by SRT2104 and FCR leak was reduced in unloaded gastrocnemius muscles. (4) Interestingly, H2O2 flux and concentration increased with SRT2104 intervention, concomitant with an increase in superoxide dismutase in the gastrocnemius. (5) Importantly, SRT2014 significantly attenuated skeletal muscle atrophy during unloading. These data indicate that SRT2104 protected mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle. A discussion of the physiological relevance of our findings follows. This study provides important new information about mitochondrial function markers in a ground analog for spaceflight. The hypothesis that SIRT1 could protect mitochondrial function, perturbations in redox biology, and thus mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy during unloading could be further tested. Hindlimb unloading resulted in lesser intrinsic maximal electron transfer capacity in the gastrocnemius muscle compared to control rats. However, rats treated with SRT2104, while undergoing hindlimb unloading did not experience the same deficit in maximal electron transfer capacity as those just hindlimb unloaded. Additionally, hindlimb-unloaded rats also had a lesser contribution of complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to maximal electron transfer than control rats and SRT2104-treated rats. Complex I is suggested to be the predominant source of ROS compared to the other complexes of the electron transfer system [37,38]. Interestingly, hindlimb-unloaded rats had a greater contribution of LEAK to maximal electron transfer compared to control and SIRT rats. A greater relative proton leak may be an attempted protective mechanism to mitigate elevated ROS concentrations observed in hindlimb-unloaded rats. High oxidative stress and ROS production may induce greater proton leak, generating a positive feedback loop between ROS and proton leak [39]. However, proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane results in a decrease in the proton gradient that is generated by the electron transfer system and less protons being utilized in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production for cellular energy. This may suggest that a greater proton leak also signifies less efficient energy production in hindlimb unloaded rats. Correspondingly, in the current study, hindlimb-unloaded rats also had greater H2O2 concentrations in the soleus muscle and tended to have greater H2O2 concentrations in the gastrocnemius muscle than control rats. Unexpectedly, rats treated with SRT2104 had greater H2O2 production and concentration in both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Conversely to hindlimb unloaded rats, SRT2104-treated rats had lower integrative LEAK than both control and hindlimb-unloaded rats. This may indicate that SRT2104-treated rats did not experience the same protective proton leak as hindlimb-unloaded rats. However, in previous research, the levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 increased in the muscles of SRT2104-treated mice [31]. This is potentially an adaptive response to mitigate ROS-induced cellular damage, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. The current study noted greater general SOD activity in rats that were hindlimb-unloaded only and in rats treated with SRT2104 during hindlimb unloading. While increasing SOD activity may be a mechanism to combat unloading-induced ROS production, increased SOD without a compensatory increase in catalase or GPx would permit increased levels of H2O2. However, GPx activity was not different with either treatment. Given that SOD converts the toxic superoxide (O2.−) to less toxic H2O2, while GPx eliminates H2O2 into nontoxic H2O and O2, the ramification of trading of O2.− for H2O2 is unresolved in unloaded skeletal muscle. Further, the effect of SRT2014 on cellular glutathione levels that could buffer H2O2 are unknown. Importantly, the current study did not investigate the influence of SIRT activation on Nox2, another predominant source of ROS that we have reported contributes directly to unlading induced atrophy [8]. Unloaded mice had markers of oxidative stress and atrophy of myofibers. Previous research indicated that H2O2 production in the soleus muscle of mice which were immobilized for 14 days was over 10 pmol·min−1·mg−1 compared to control mice at around 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1 [7]. In the current study, despite greater H2O2 production within rats treated with SRT2104 compared to control rats, production did not exceed 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein; thus, it may be possible that this elevation in H2O2 production was not significant enough to perpetuate oxidative damage. Additionally, in the current study, mitochondrial capacities in rats treated with SRT2104 were similar to control rats, while hindlimb-unloaded rats exhibited several differences in mitochondrial functionality. This may suggest that, despite elevated ROS production, SRT2104 preserved mitochondrial capacities during hindlimb unloading, potentially due to protective antioxidant mechanisms. Unlike the gastrocnemius muscle, the soleus muscle did not exhibit significant changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or electron transfer capacities in response to hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment. Previous investigations have reported reduced cross-sectional area, a dramatic decrease in total protein, and a decrease in total succinate dehydrogenase activity (activity × cross-sectional area) of both slow- and fast-twitch fibers in the soleus muscle following spaceflight and microgravity [40]. However, succinate dehydrogenase activity decreased in concert with decreased fiber size. Since the mitochondrial measures in the current study were normalized to tissue weight, protein content, or citrate synthase activity, it is possible that mitochondrial measures decreased proportionally with muscle mass. As such, this could be why there were no significant differences in the mitochondrial measures of the soleus after normalization. In support of this, the current study identified that, within the right soleus, muscle mass was lowest in hindlimb-unloaded rats and greatest in control rats. While, within the left soleus, there was no difference in muscle mass of rats treated with SRT2104 and control rats, but the mass of hindlimb-unloaded rats was lower than both groups. Within the gastrocnemius, muscle mass was lowest in hindlimb-unloaded rats and greatest in control rats. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been linked to muscle disuse atrophy in several ways. Mitochondrial ROS production is thought to be a signaling factor, which is connected to protease activity and myofiber atrophy in immobilized muscle [7]. Additionally, changes in mitochondrial morphology and expression of mitochondrial fission genes play a role in mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK activation, perpetuating muscle wasting [41]. Intrinsic mitochondrial function and maximal electron transfer capacity were lower in the gastrocnemius of hindlimb-unloaded rats than either SRT2104-treated rats or control rats, which might have contributed to depressed muscle mass in hindlimb-unloaded rats. Significantly, rats that were hindlimb-unloaded but treated with SRT2104 maintained mitochondrial capacities similar to ambulatory control rats and maintained muscle mass greater than that of the hindlimb-unloaded rats without SRT2104 treatment. Within the soleus and the gastrocnemius muscles, there was no treatment-induced differences in citrate synthase activity. However, previous work using transmission electron microscopy identified greater mitochondrial size in muscles of SRT2104-fed mice, despite no change in citrate synthase activity [31]. Therefore, SRT2104 may also alter mitochondrial size, but this was not identified using the techniques employed in the current study. Importantly, greater mitochondrial size does not always translate to enhanced energy production. Thus, the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation, using techniques such as high-resolution respirometry, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function. Prior research has suggested that responses to spaceflight differ between slow- and fast-twitch fiber types and that subsarcolemmal mitochondria and intermyofibrillar mitochondria also respond differently to spaceflight [2]. Specifically, subsarcolemmal mitochondria had decreased state II respiration with hindlimb unloading, but intermyofibrillar mitochondria did not [42]. Within the current study, there was no isolation of fiber types or specific mitochondrial subpopulations. Thus, overall, there were no significant changes in citrate synthase activity or integrative cytochrome c oxidase activity, but, potentially, there may have been fiber-type or mitochondria-type specific differences, which were not identified via the methods utilized. Overall, hindlimb unloading did not appear to significantly impact mitochondrial function in the highly oxidative soleus muscle, but it did alter mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer capacities in the gastrocnemius muscle. Rats were treated with the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104, while hindlimb-unloaded had gastrocnemius mitochondrial capacities closer to those of ambulatory control rats. These results suggest that SIRT1 activation was able to preserve or restore mitochondrial function under conditions where the muscle is inactive. Ultimately, these results suggest SIRT1 may be beneficial in maintaining healthy myocytes in microgravity through promoting appropriate mitochondrial energy production required for cellular action.",

Copyright notice ID: 10342025 PMID: 37446313 Abstract Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, spaceflight, skeletal muscle, electron transfer system, SRT2104, mitochondria, respiration, oxidative stress, antioxidants1. Introduction Disuse and mechanical unloading that occur during spaceflight can result in detrimental skeletal muscle atrophy and defects in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and function. Specifically, spaceflight and microgravity result in decreased muscle fiber size and altered activity of several metabolic enzymes in the soleus and tibialis muscles [1]. Within fast-twitch fibers, space flight decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity in the subsarcolemmal region, while slow-twitch fibers experienced altered distribution of succinate dehydrogenase activity across the entire fiber [2]. Additionally, simulated microgravity increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple cell types [3,4] and elevated pro-inflammatory signaling [5,6]. Sources of ROS that have been demonstrated to contribute to unloading-induced muscle atrophy include the mitochondria [7] and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) [8,9]. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to skeletal muscle wasting with denervation [10,11], unloading [7], and cachexia [12,13,14]. Thus, there is a glaring need for preventative measures to maintain skeletal muscle health in astronauts enduring microgravity during their journeys to space. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that respond to alterations in mechanical loading [15]. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insufficient levels of stress proteins are proposed cellular mechanisms by which unloading causes pathology and impairment in musculoskeletal function. Mitochondrial ROS also appears to contribute to unloading-induced atrophy [7]. Mitochondria have many essential cellular roles, including mitochondria’s well known, essential function in energy production. Oxidative energy production in mitochondria is accomplished through enzymatic pathways in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), as well as substrate flux through the ETC, are important markers of metabolism adversely affected by unloading and spaceflight [16,17]. In addition, ROS production by electron leakage from the ETC can contribute to elevated oxidative stress during unloading [7,18]. Thus, there is current thought that preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of ROS leakage could mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight and disuse [14,19]. Recent evidence has suggested that a pathway involving AMP kinase (AMPK) and siruitin-1 (SIRT1) can be instrumental not only in mitochondrial biogenesis [20,21], but also in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass [22]. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase that influences the activity of several enzymes and transcriptional regulators [23,24,25,26]. SIRT1 mediates responses to inflammatory, metabolic, and oxidative stressors. Specifically, SIRT1 moderates mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) [27,28,29]. Previous studies have identified several beneficial effects of SIRT1 activation on musculoskeletal and systemic health via pharmacological treatments, including improved endurance [30,31]. SIRT1 is also involved in skeletal muscle repair [22] and resveratrol’s anti-atrophic effects in aging skeletal muscle occur via SIRT1 [32]. Loss of SIRT1 appears to play a role in food depravation-induced muscle atrophy [33]. However, the potential mitigating role of SIRT1 in unloading-induced mitochondrial function and muscle atrophy is poorly understood. SRT2104 is a small molecule SIRT1 agonist that induces SIRT1 and downstream signaling [34]. For example, SIRT1 attenuated age-induced loss of muscle mass in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles [31]. In addition, SRT2104 treatment reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and elevated PGC-1α during hindlimb unloading in old mice [31]. Together, these results suggest SRT2104 could improve mitochondrial function and protect against muscle wasting. However, the impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ROS production has not been determined with mechanical unloading. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SRT2104 would rescue mechanical unloading-induced impairments in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, modulate redox responses, and protect skeletal muscle (e.g., soleus, gastrocnemius) mass. Fischer-344 rats were divided into the following conditions: ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 10 days (HU), and hindlimb unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT).2. Results 2.1. Mitochondrial Enzyme Activities Citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities were quantified in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles of all rats as indicators of mitochondrial volume density and function, respectively [35,36]. Within the soleus muscle, CS activity, as well as integrative (relative to mg protein) and intrinsic (relative to CS activity) CCO activities, were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Figure 1A,C,E). Within the gastrocnemius muscle, CS activity and integrative CCO activity were similarly unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Figure 1B,D). However, intrinsic CCO activity was lesser in HU rats compared to CON (p = 0.006) and SIRT rats (p = 0.0002; Figure 1F). Figure 1.

(A,B) Citrate synthase and (C,D) integrative (relative to mg protein) and (E,F) intrinsic (relative to CS activity) cytochrome c oxidase activities in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles of ambulatory control rats (CON; n = 6), rats hindlimb unloaded for 10 days (HU; n = 6), and rats hindlimb unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT; n = 4). Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).2.2. High Resolution Respirometry Oxidative phosphorylation (P) and electron transfer (E) capacities were determined via high-resolution respirometry. Respiration data are presented either as integrative (relative to tissue wet weight), intrinsic (relative to CS activity; mitochondrial volume density), or as a ratio of the measure of interest to maximal electron transfer capacity (flux control ratio; FCR). Within the soleus muscle, integrative and intrinsic capacities and FCRs were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment (Supplementary Figures S1–S3). Conversely, within the gastrocnemius muscle, integrative mitochondrial proton LEAK, a dissipative respiratory state not resulting in biochemical work, was lesser in SIRT rats than HU (p = 0.002) or CON rats (p = 0.03; Figure 2A). Integrative capacities of oxidative phosphorylation supported by complex I (PCI and PCIG), maximal coupled oxidative phosphorylation (PCI+II), maximal noncoupled electron transfer (ECI+II), and electron transfer supported by complex II only (ECII) were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Within the gastrocnemius muscle, intrinsic ECI+II was lesser in HU rats than CON (p = 0.04), but there was no difference between HU and SIRT rats (Figure 3E). Intrinsic LEAK, PCI, PCI+II, and ECII were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment. Figure 3.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Also within the gastrocnemius, the contribution of LEAK to maximal electron transfer (flux control ratio; FCRLEAK) was greater in HU rats than CON (p = 0.03) or SIRT rats (p = 0.002; Figure 4A). Additionally, the FCR for oxidative phosphorylation supported by complex I (FCRPCI) was lesser in CON rats than HU rats (p = 0.01), but it was not different between CON and SIRT rats. Further, the FCR when glutamate was added as an additional complex I substrate (FCRPCIG) was lesser in both CON and SIRT rats compared to HU rats (p ≤ 0.005). However, the FCR for maximal coupled oxidative phosphorylation (FCRPCI+II) and noncoupled electron transfer supported by complex II only (FCRECII) were unaffected by hindlimb unloading or SRT2104.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).2.3. Reactive Oxygen Species Within the soleus muscle, the rate of production of the ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in isolated mitochondria was greater in SIRT rats compared to CON (p < 0.0001) and HU rats (p = 0.0007; Figure 5B). Similarly, SIRT rats had the greatest H2O2 concentrations (vs. HU: p = 0.0005; vs. CON: p < 0.0001), with HU having intermediate concentrations, and CON rats having the lowest H2O2 concentrations (vs. HU: p = 0.02; Figure 5D). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Effect of the Sirtuin-1 Agonist SRT2104 on reactive oxygen species in hindlimb unloaded rats. H2O2 production and concentration in isolated mitochondria from soleus (A,C) and gastrocnemius (B,D) muscles of ambulatory control rats (CON; n = 6), rats hindlimbs unloaded for 10 days (HU; n = 3), and rats hindlimbs unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT; n = 4). Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Similarly, within the gastrocnemius muscle, H2O2 production was greater in SIRT rats than CON (p = 0.004) and HU rats (p = 0.003; Figure 5A). Additionally, H2O2 concentration tended to be greater in HU than CON rats (p = 0.08), while SIRT rats had greater H2O2 concentration than either CON (p = 0.003) or HU rats (p = 0.01; Figure 5C).2.4. Antioxidant Enzyme Activities Due to a lack of sample volume, antioxidant enzyme activities were only investigated in the gastrocnemius muscle. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was greater in HU (p = 0.004) and SIRT (p = 0.009) rats compared to CON, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity did not differ between treatment groups (Figure 6).

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).2.5. Muscle Weights The right soleus and left gastrocnemius muscles were lesser in weight in HU rats compared CON (p ≤ 0.0002) rats, and SIRT was lesser than CON (p ≤ 0.03) (Figure 7). The right soleus was lesser weight in HU rats compared to SIRT (p = 0.0002), and the left gastrocnemius tended to be lesser in weight in HU rats compared to SIRT (p = 0.07). The left soleus muscle was lesser in weight in HU rats than in SIRT or in CON (p ≤ 0.0003). Figure 7.

Values are means ± SEM. ns indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).3. Discussion The primary findings of this study are as follows (1) The SIRT1 agonist SRT2104 reduced integrative proton leak in unloaded gastrocnemius muscles. (2) SRT2104 increased cytochrome c oxidase activity compared to the unloaded gastrocnemius, while citrate synthase trended higher in the SIRT soleus. (3) Intrinsic O2 flux was increased by SRT2104 and FCR leak was reduced in unloaded gastrocnemius muscles. (4) Interestingly, H2O2 flux and concentration increased with SRT2104 intervention, concomitant with an increase in superoxide dismutase in the gastrocnemius. (5) Importantly, SRT2014 significantly attenuated skeletal muscle atrophy during unloading. These data indicate that SRT2104 protected mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle. A discussion of the physiological relevance of our findings follows. This study provides important new information about mitochondrial function markers in a ground analog for spaceflight. The hypothesis that SIRT1 could protect mitochondrial function, perturbations in redox biology, and thus mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy during unloading could be further tested. Hindlimb unloading resulted in lesser intrinsic maximal electron transfer capacity in the gastrocnemius muscle compared to control rats. However, rats treated with SRT2104, while undergoing hindlimb unloading did not experience the same deficit in maximal electron transfer capacity as those just hindlimb unloaded. Additionally, hindlimb-unloaded rats also had a lesser contribution of complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to maximal electron transfer than control rats and SRT2104-treated rats. Complex I is suggested to be the predominant source of ROS compared to the other complexes of the electron transfer system [37,38]. Interestingly, hindlimb-unloaded rats had a greater contribution of LEAK to maximal electron transfer compared to control and SIRT rats. A greater relative proton leak may be an attempted protective mechanism to mitigate elevated ROS concentrations observed in hindlimb-unloaded rats. High oxidative stress and ROS production may induce greater proton leak, generating a positive feedback loop between ROS and proton leak [39]. However, proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane results in a decrease in the proton gradient that is generated by the electron transfer system and less protons being utilized in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production for cellular energy. This may suggest that a greater proton leak also signifies less efficient energy production in hindlimb unloaded rats. Correspondingly, in the current study, hindlimb-unloaded rats also had greater H2O2 concentrations in the soleus muscle and tended to have greater H2O2 concentrations in the gastrocnemius muscle than control rats. Unexpectedly, rats treated with SRT2104 had greater H2O2 production and concentration in both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Conversely to hindlimb unloaded rats, SRT2104-treated rats had lower integrative LEAK than both control and hindlimb-unloaded rats. This may indicate that SRT2104-treated rats did not experience the same protective proton leak as hindlimb-unloaded rats. However, in previous research, the levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 increased in the muscles of SRT2104-treated mice [31]. This is potentially an adaptive response to mitigate ROS-induced cellular damage, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. The current study noted greater general SOD activity in rats that were hindlimb-unloaded only and in rats treated with SRT2104 during hindlimb unloading. While increasing SOD activity may be a mechanism to combat unloading-induced ROS production, increased SOD without a compensatory increase in catalase or GPx would permit increased levels of H2O2. However, GPx activity was not different with either treatment. Given that SOD converts the toxic superoxide (O2.−) to less toxic H2O2, while GPx eliminates H2O2 into nontoxic H2O and O2, the ramification of trading of O2.− for H2O2 is unresolved in unloaded skeletal muscle. Further, the effect of SRT2014 on cellular glutathione levels that could buffer H2O2 are unknown. Importantly, the current study did not investigate the influence of SIRT activation on Nox2, another predominant source of ROS that we have reported contributes directly to unlading induced atrophy [8]. Unloaded mice had markers of oxidative stress and atrophy of myofibers. Previous research indicated that H2O2 production in the soleus muscle of mice which were immobilized for 14 days was over 10 pmol·min−1·mg−1 compared to control mice at around 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1 [7]. In the current study, despite greater H2O2 production within rats treated with SRT2104 compared to control rats, production did not exceed 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein; thus, it may be possible that this elevation in H2O2 production was not significant enough to perpetuate oxidative damage. Additionally, in the current study, mitochondrial capacities in rats treated with SRT2104 were similar to control rats, while hindlimb-unloaded rats exhibited several differences in mitochondrial functionality. This may suggest that, despite elevated ROS production, SRT2104 preserved mitochondrial capacities during hindlimb unloading, potentially due to protective antioxidant mechanisms. Unlike the gastrocnemius muscle, the soleus muscle did not exhibit significant changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or electron transfer capacities in response to hindlimb unloading or SRT2104 treatment. Previous investigations have reported reduced cross-sectional area, a dramatic decrease in total protein, and a decrease in total succinate dehydrogenase activity (activity × cross-sectional area) of both slow- and fast-twitch fibers in the soleus muscle following spaceflight and microgravity [40]. However, succinate dehydrogenase activity decreased in concert with decreased fiber size. Since the mitochondrial measures in the current study were normalized to tissue weight, protein content, or citrate synthase activity, it is possible that mitochondrial measures decreased proportionally with muscle mass. As such, this could be why there were no significant differences in the mitochondrial measures of the soleus after normalization. In support of this, the current study identified that, within the right soleus, muscle mass was lowest in hindlimb-unloaded rats and greatest in control rats. While, within the left soleus, there was no difference in muscle mass of rats treated with SRT2104 and control rats, but the mass of hindlimb-unloaded rats was lower than both groups. Within the gastrocnemius, muscle mass was lowest in hindlimb-unloaded rats and greatest in control rats. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been linked to muscle disuse atrophy in several ways. Mitochondrial ROS production is thought to be a signaling factor, which is connected to protease activity and myofiber atrophy in immobilized muscle [7]. Additionally, changes in mitochondrial morphology and expression of mitochondrial fission genes play a role in mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK activation, perpetuating muscle wasting [41]. Intrinsic mitochondrial function and maximal electron transfer capacity were lower in the gastrocnemius of hindlimb-unloaded rats than either SRT2104-treated rats or control rats, which might have contributed to depressed muscle mass in hindlimb-unloaded rats. Significantly, rats that were hindlimb-unloaded but treated with SRT2104 maintained mitochondrial capacities similar to ambulatory control rats and maintained muscle mass greater than that of the hindlimb-unloaded rats without SRT2104 treatment. Within the soleus and the gastrocnemius muscles, there was no treatment-induced differences in citrate synthase activity. However, previous work using transmission electron microscopy identified greater mitochondrial size in muscles of SRT2104-fed mice, despite no change in citrate synthase activity [31]. Therefore, SRT2104 may also alter mitochondrial size, but this was not identified using the techniques employed in the current study. Importantly, greater mitochondrial size does not always translate to enhanced energy production. Thus, the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation, using techniques such as high-resolution respirometry, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function. Prior research has suggested that responses to spaceflight differ between slow- and fast-twitch fiber types and that subsarcolemmal mitochondria and intermyofibrillar mitochondria also respond differently to spaceflight [2]. Specifically, subsarcolemmal mitochondria had decreased state II respiration with hindlimb unloading, but intermyofibrillar mitochondria did not [42]. Within the current study, there was no isolation of fiber types or specific mitochondrial subpopulations. Thus, overall, there were no significant changes in citrate synthase activity or integrative cytochrome c oxidase activity, but, potentially, there may have been fiber-type or mitochondria-type specific differences, which were not identified via the methods utilized. Overall, hindlimb unloading did not appear to significantly impact mitochondrial function in the highly oxidative soleus muscle, but it did alter mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer capacities in the gastrocnemius muscle. Rats were treated with the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104, while hindlimb-unloaded had gastrocnemius mitochondrial capacities closer to those of ambulatory control rats. These results suggest that SIRT1 activation was able to preserve or restore mitochondrial function under conditions where the muscle is inactive. Ultimately, these results suggest SIRT1 may be beneficial in maintaining healthy myocytes in microgravity through promoting appropriate mitochondrial energy production required for cellular action.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animal Housing and Management Four-month-old male Fisher-344 (F344) rats, a common rodent model for mechanical unloading and spaceflight, were purchased from Envigo (F344 rats, Envigo RMS, LLC, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and used in this study. Phenotypic muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shifts from slow to fast-twitch in F344 rats are similar to humans [40]. Rats were kept in a 12/12 h daylight cycle, temperature-controlled room, and provided chow and water ad libitum. Animal care met all federal stipulations per  statutes (NRC Guide for Care and Use of lab animals, 8th Edition, 2011) and was consistent with the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy, as well as the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.4.2. Experimental Design and Hindlimb Unloading Fisher-344 rats were divided into three groups: ambulatory controls (CON, n = 6), hindlimb-unloaded for 10 days (HU, n = 6), and hindlimb-unloaded + 25 mg/kg/day (I.P. injection) SRT2104 (SIRT, n = 4). SRT2104 was purchased from MedChemExpress (Sirt1 activator: CAS No. 1093403-33-8, Cat No. HY-15262, MedChemExpress, Brunswick Township, NJ, USA). Hindlimb unloading in rodents was conducted with an adaptation of the technique previously described by our laboratory [8,9]. We employed a hindlimb harness to produce unloading, as previously described by Mortreux (2020) [43]. The copper wire harness was overfitted with elastic tubing and moleskin as a pliable cushion. The harness was hoisted using a stainless-steel chain attached to a fishing tackle swivel, which was allowed to move freely on a lubricated brass rod. The hindlimb harness allowed rodents to maneuver around the cage with their hindlimb paws just above the cage bedding. Hindlimb unloading replicates the physiological effects of bedrest and spaceflight [8,9]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg). To reverse the anesthetic effect of xylazine, 1 mg for every 10 mg xylazine of Atipamezole (5 mg/mL Conc.) was injected IP. Rats were then fitted with a flexible harness attached to a crosswire through a swivel that allowed ambulation around the cage and free access to food and water. Rats were then elevated at a spinal angle of 40° so that hindfeet were approximately 1 cm off the cage floor. At the end of the 10-day hindlimb unloading period, rats from all groups were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg).4.3. Sample Collection After animal euthanization, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected, cleaned in PBS, and weighed. Both the soleus and the red gastrocnemius muscles are considered highly oxidative, with more mitochondria content [44,45,46]. Tissues were aliquoted and stored in three ways: (1) flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until mitochondrial enzyme and antioxidant activity analyses; (2) placed directly into 1 mL ice-cold mitochondrial preservation solution (BIOPS; 10 mM Ca-EGTA buffer, 0.1 µM free calcium, 20 mM imidazole, 20 mM taurine, 50 mM K-MES, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 6.56 mM MgCl2, 5.77 mM ATP, and 15 mM phosphocreatine; pH 7.1) and stored on ice for same day analysis of mitochondrial capacities; and (3) placed in 1mL ice-cold 1X PBS 1 mM EGTA for same-day mitochondrial isolation and analysis of H2O2 production. The left soleus was used for mitochondrial analyses, while the right soleus was used for quantification of H2O2 production. The left gastrocnemius was aliquoted and used for all analyses.4.4. Mitochondrial Enzyme Activities Citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities were determined as measures of mitochondrial volume density and function, respectively, using kinetic colorimetry, as previously described [47,48]. Frozen muscle tissue was cryopulverized (Spectrum™ Bessman Tissue Pulverizer; Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) and then sonicated 3 times for 3 s each in chilled sucrose homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) with 1 part 5% detergent (n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside; Sigma D4641). Samples were centrifuged at 11,000× g for 3 min at 0 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C for future analysis. Enzyme activities were determined using a microplate reader (Synergy H1; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Citrate synthase activity was determined by measuring the linear rate of reaction of free CoA-SH with DTNB at 412 nm at 37 °C and CCO activity determined by measuring the linear rate of oxidation of fully reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm at 37 °C. Both assays utilized 80-fold diluted muscle homogenate and were analyzed in duplicate. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for CS activity were 4.3% and 1.9%, respectively. Intra-assay and inter-assay CVs for CCO activity were 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Each enzyme activity was then normalized to total protein content, which was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was further normalized to CS activity (intrinsic), giving a measure of function per mitochondria in the sample [36].4.5. High-Resolution Respirometry High-resolution respirometry was used to measure mitochondrial capacities. All muscle samples were analyzed within 12 h of collection and remained submerged in ice-cold BIOPS solution on ice or at 4 °C until analysis between collection and analysis. Immediately prior to analysis, samples were permeabilized, as described previously [47]. Permeabilized fibers were then rinsed in mitochondrial respiration solution (Mir05; 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM potassium lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2∙6H2O, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 1 g/L BSA, pH 7.1) on a plate rocker for 10 min at 4 °C. Approximately 1.5 to 2.5 mg (wet weight) of rinsed fibers were then immediately added to each chamber of an Oroboros Oxygraph-2k (O2k; Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria), containing MiR06 (MiR05 + 280 U/mL catalase) and 20 mM creatine. Chambers were maintained at 37 °C and in hyperoxic conditions (200 to 650 µM O2) through addition of 200 mM H2O2. The previously described [49] substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration protocol for this study was as follows: (1) complex I substrates, pyruvate (5 mM), and malate (1 mM) to determine nonphosphorylating proton leak (LEAK); (2) adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 2.5 mM), to quantify complex I-supported P (PCI); (3) glutamate (10 mM), an additional complex I substrate (PCIG); (4) cytochrome c (10 µM), to measure integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane; (5) the complex II substrate, succinate (10 mM), to measure maximal coupled P (PCI+II); (6) uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 0.5 µM steps), to attain maximal noncoupled E (ECI+II); (7) a complex I inhibitor, rotenone (0.5µM), to measure complex II-supported E (ECII); and (8) a complex III inhibitor, antimycin A (2.5 µM), to quantify non-mitochondrial residual O2 consumption. All data were normalized to residual O2 consumption. Samples were re-analyzed if respiration increased greater than 10%, following the addition of exogenous cytochrome c (step 4 in protocol listed above). Respiration data are presented either relative to tissue weight (integrative), CS activity (mitochondrial volume density; intrinsic), or as a ratio of the measure of interest to ECI+II (flux control ratio, FCR).4.6. Reactive Oxygen Species Fat and connective tissue were mechanically removed, and the muscle was minced into fine pieces then incubated in 0.025% trypsin (MilliporeSigma cat#T4799, Burlington, NJ, USA) and mitochondria were isolated, as previously described [50]. Samples were homogenized in mitochondrial isolation medium (MIM: 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.1) containing 1 mg/mL BSA, on ice [51]. Muscle homogenates were subjected to a first centrifugation step (800× g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was again centrifuged (12,000× g, 10 min, 4 °C). The final pellet (isolated mitochondria) was resuspended in 150 µL MIM, and protein quantification was assessed using the Coomasie Bradford Protein assay (Thermo Scientific). H2O2 production and concentration were quantified fluorometrically using a commercially available kit (AmplexRed, Catalog #A22188, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).4.7. Antioxidant Enzyme Activities Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured using commercially available kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Cryopulverized muscle tissue was homogenized in extraction buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000× g for 2 min at 0 °C, as previously described [51]. Supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. For SOD, an 80-fold dilution of the homogenate diluted 1:5 in provided sample buffer was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate with an intra-assay CV of 4%. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. For GPx, a 40-fold dilution of the homogenate was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate, with an intra-assay CV of 3%. Both activities were normalized to protein content, determined using the Coomassie Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).4.8. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS v.9.4 with the fixed effect of treatment and animal within treatment as a random effect. Muscles were analyzed separately. All data are expressed as estimates of least squares means ± SEM. Significance was declared when p ≤ 0.05 and trends when 0.05 ≤ p ≤ 0.1.Abbreviations ROS Reactive Oxygen Species SIRT1 Sirtuin 1 SRT2104 SIRT1 activator CON Control HU Hindlimb Unloading Nox2 NADPH oxidase-2 H2O2 hydrogen peroxide PGC-1α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α CS Citrate synthase CCO cytochrome c oxidase FCR flux control ratio PCI oxidative phosphorylation supported by complex I PCI+II maximal coupled oxidative phosphorylation ECI+II maximal noncoupled electron transfer ECII electron transfer supported by complex II only SOD Superoxide dismutase GPx glutathione peroxidase ATP adenosine triphosphate MIM mitochondrial isolation medium Open in a new tabSupplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms241311135/s1.

    "title": "Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: Proof of concept.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.

    "introduction": "Introduction Mitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight requires a better mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to Mars and the moon. Extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. The microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness1–4. Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue4–8. Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASA’s long-term mission objectives. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading9,10. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments11–15. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers16,17. In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross-sectional area4,6. A common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein18–20. However, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity21, disuse22, cancer23, and aging24 compromises physical function and systemic health. Rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceflight microgravity conditions25–27. These bioreactors produce a low-shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain aspects of weightlessness27. However, they are not suitable for inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle fibers experience during exercise in spaceflight. Although tumbler bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation, they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise. Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through muscle fibers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium)28. Skeletal muscles are organized as multinucleated myofibers, whose function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis. Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area29,30, and shifting the % of slow-twitch fibers31,32. Unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased protein anabolism8. In addition, there is an increase in connective tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well33. Thus, maintaining mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes) to simulate spaceflight or exercise during spaceflight should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels bioreactors. Ergo, to study the physiological responses of skeletal muscle fibers to tensile loading, myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin-coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses34. Based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial loading35. Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system fitted that includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myotubes36,37 as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry into gravitational environments.",
    "methods": "Methods Cell culture proliferation and differential protocol We used a commonly used immortal cell line (C2C12) (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA) derived from mouse skeletal muscle, generously provide by Dr. James Fluckey’s Muscle Biology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. C2C12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber filled with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, growth medium (DMEM + NA Pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO235,73. Once the myoblast cultures reached 60–65% confluency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized and re-cultured in 4 well-2 cm2 silicone chambers coated by laminin at 37 °C and 5% CO2, using 1 ml per well. Once the cells reached 70–80% confluency, myotube differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium DMEM (-) NA Pyruvate, supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% insulin-transferrin-selenium. To study the effects of increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes, we maintained myotubes on laminin-coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a StrexCell® system, then observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses34. Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the myotube silicone chambers were exposed to the uniaxial stretching using the StrexCell® unit. The differentiation medium was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions. StrexCell loading and unloading protocol Cyclic stretch of skeletal muscle cell cultures or “myotubes” has been used to mimic the loading pattern of skeletal muscle-induced hypertrophy and atrophy74. However, several limitations for the FlexCell system that could impair compatibility for research in spaceflight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum pump, considerable weight, and difficulty generating true uniaxial stretch. StrexCell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer-controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low frequencies of 1–20%. Myoblasts and myotubes on a StrexCell system were exposed to uniaxial stress/tensile loads and release of tensile loading. While the myotubes were not free floating, they are plated on laminin that simulates the extracellular matrix/endothelium normally attached to muscle fibers surrounding myocytes. The myoblast and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium, which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level, gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion affinity, intermolecular forces, and fluid dynamics, especially in an aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotubes. Importantly, adhesion to laminin allows controlled levels of uniaxial stretch to be exercise on myotubes that simulates tensile loading in an aqueous environment. We used a StrexCell® STB-1400 (B-Bridge International, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) to apply a cyclic uniaxial stretch on C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 5a). The stretch instrument employs a computer-controlled stepper motor to drive two metal frames apart. A flexible silicone chamber was attached to both frames, and the chamber was stretched and released in a programmable sinusoidal oscillation. STB-1400 includes a 10 cm2 stretch chamber model (Culture area: 3.2 × 3.2 × 1.0 cm), which supports up to 6 chambers simultaneously. The C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in silicon stretch chambers coated with laminin (Fig. 5a). The amount of strain experienced by the myotubes was measured as the percent change in the stretch from the starting position (Fig. 5b). Based on the preliminary validation experiments and the published report of Soltow, et al. (2013)35, the strain program was set at 0.7 Hz frequency, 12% stretch using a sinusoidal wave pattern for 1 hour/day for 2 or 5 days. Exposure to the uniaxial cyclic stretching was utilized to induce hypertrophy with increased loading. Conversely, cyclic stretch cessation was deemed off-transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy release of cyclic tensile loads, with replicate control cultures maintained under quiescent conditions with no applied cyclic strain.

Five different groups were assigned (n = 4/group): (a) 2 days no stretch controls (no Stretch 2d), (b) 5 days no Stretch controls (no Stretch 5d), (c) 2 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) (2dHY), (d) 5 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) (5dHY), (e) 2 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) + 3 days cessation of stretching (3dAT). Myotubes cultures were collected at the end of each group protocol to be fixed for immunofluorescence imaging or homogenized using lysis buffer for western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy Immunofluorescence imaging was performed to observe cell morphology. C2C12 myotubes were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the myotubes were washed three times with 1X PBS. Cell membranes were solubilized for intracellular assays using a 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 3 min until washed with 1X PBS. Myotubes were blocked with 1X PBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 5% goat serum for 30 min at RT. Myotubes were then incubated with β-sarcoglycan (membrane marker) primary antibody (1:200 β-sarcoglycan mouse mAb, abcam, Cat # ab55683) for 1 h at RT, and subsequently washed with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min). Myotubes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:250 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Flour 488, ThermoFisher, Cat # A-11029) for 1 h at RT, followed by washing with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then counterstaining with 1 µg/µl DAPI. After washing with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then double-distilled water (2 × 5 min), slides were mounted with antifade mounting medium (ProLong™ Gold Antifade, Invitrogen, cat # P36930). Myotubes immunofluorescence staining was visualized using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP8 Confocal Lightning GPU-based Deconvolution (20X, zoom 2.25, emission wavelength 450–500 nm) in the Texas A&M Image Analysis Core Laboratory. Images were analyzed using Leica LAS X software v.4.3 and  ImageJ (Fiji. ImageJ v.1.53k) software for fiber diameter assessment and nucleus quantification. Western immunoblot Protein abundance was as described by Lawler et al. (2021)4 and determined by Western immunoblot analysis. The whole-cell lysate was collected using TRIS HCL lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector). Twenty µg of protein samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at 120 V for 75 min using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel box onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad: Hercules, CA). The membranes were then blocked in a non-fat milk buffer (5% non-fat milk in TBS) for 1 h. Following blocking, membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) in a blocking buffer with the appropriate primary antibodies: Anabolic signaling (anti-total Akt (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4691 S), anti-Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (rabbit pAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 9271 S), anti-Talin (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4021); Catabolic signaling with anti-Foxo3a (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 12829 S) and anti-phospho-Foxo3a at Ser473 (rabbit pAb; 1:300; Cell Signaling Cat# 9464 L); inflammatory markers anti-IL-1β (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12703), anti-IL-6 (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12912), and anti-P65 (mouse mAb; 1:500; abcam, Cat# ab32536). Then, the membranes were washed with T-TBS (3 × 5 min) and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad, cat# 1705061) enhanced chemiluminescence detection and developed using a Cytiva Amersham ImageQuant™ 800 Western Blot Imaging System (Cytiva). Quantification was performed by ImageQuant™ TL10 v.10.2 and  ImageJ software with Ponceau-S staining serving as a loading control. Calpain activity Calpain activity was performed using a Calpain Activity Assay Fluorometric Kit (Abcam # ab65308) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 20 µg of the whole-cell lysate (mixed with lysis buffer provided with the kit). Calpain activities for each sample were expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFUs) per milligram of protein per minute (RFU/μg/min). The fluorescence signal was detected at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector). Statistical approach Results were collected and processed for statistical analysis using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). One-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was performed to distinguish among group mean differences and between the different variables with significance set at P < 0.05. A nested ANOVA design was used to quantify myotube diameter. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
    "results": "Results Myotube morphology in response to cyclic stretch, cessation of daily stretch To study the effects of cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch on skeletal muscle myotube morphology and size, we used C2C12 mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on laminin. β-sarcoglycan immunofluorescence positive staining was used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy (Fig. 1). Confocal immunofluorescence quantification revealed a significant increase of 51% and 94% in mean myotube diameter following 2 and 5 days of a cyclic stretch, compared to the 2-day and 5-day quiescent controls, respectively (Fig. 1b). When myotubes underwent three days without cyclic stretch in myotubes, following 2 days of cyclic stretch, then myotube diameter was 32% lower compared to the loaded, stretched myotubes (Fig. 1b). Quantification of the total nuclei population per field revealed a significant reduction as a result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls (Fig. 1c), indicating an increase in fiber size while the nuclear number was relatively static. The fusion index was found to be increased significantly by the 2, and 5 days stretching protocol compared with quiescent controls (Fig. 1d). However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT), did not alter the fusion index compared to the 2 days cyclic stretching. Fig. 1.

The median of the data is indicated by the central line. Functional protein turnover marker with cyclic stretching and cessation of stretch We then determined the effects of (1) uniaxial cyclic stretching and (2) release from or cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch on markers of protein synthesis and proteolysis commonly used in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy studies35,38,39. Protein abundance of the focal adhesion complex and cytoskeletal protein talin was chosen as a muscle hypertrophy marker, while the activity of calpains was chosen as a proteolytic marker (Fig. 2). Our findings revealed that both 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching significantly elevated the levels of talin protein compared to the control levels (Fig. 2a). There was no statistically significant difference between 2 and 5 days of stretch on talin protein levels. Fig. 2. Markers of protein turnover: Talin protein levels and calpain activity assay. Open in a new tab a Protein abundance for talin protein levels. Protein abundance quantification was determined using Western immunoblotting with Ponceau stain as a protein loading control and quantified using ImageJ for talin. b Calpain Activity is expressed as fluorogenic values (RFU/mg/min). Myotubes were divided into the following groups (n = 4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). (a) = statistically significant difference from no-stretch (2d); (b) = significantly different than 2dHY; (c) = significantly different than 5dHY. (p ≤ 0.05) Values are presented as Box plots ±SD. The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line.However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT) resulted in a significantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5 days of daily cyclic stretch. Talin protein levels were not statistically different from quiescent myotubes that experienced no daily stress and strain due to stretch. In contrast, calpain activity that was measured by fluorescence revealed a significant increase in activity in the 2dHY and 5dHY groups, indicating that daily bouts of cyclic stretch elevated calpain levels and presumably remodeling (Fig. 2b). Myotubes that completed stretch cessation myotubes displayed calpain levels that were not statistically different than the no-stretch and 2dHY groups. Calpain activity was significantly lower in the 3dAT group vs. 5dHY myotubes. Akt and Foxo3a signaling is altered by cyclic stretch and removal of cyclic stretch The Akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. To reveal the effects of daily cyclic stretch and subsequent cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch, we measured total Akt, phosphorylated Akt at Thr308, total protein levels for FoxO3a, phosphorylated FoxO3a, and the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio (Fig. 3). Our data revealed that phosphorylated Akt levels were elevated after daily bouts of cyclic stretch (Fig. 4b). The phosphorylated Akt to total Akt activity ratio trended upwards with 2 days of a daily cyclic stretch but was not different from than controls (Fig. 3c). Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in 3dAT than in 2dHY but were no different than controls (Fig. 3b). pAkt/total Akt for 3dAT was similar to the no stretch control group. Fig. 3.

The median of the data is indicated by the central line.The FoxO3a transcription factor can be phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt phosphorylation or conversely dephosphorylated and stimulated by pro-inflammatory signaling. Total protein levels for FoxO3a were elevated by almost 3-fold after cessation of daily cyclic stretch compared with the no stretch, 2dHY and 5dHY groups (Fig. 3d). However, the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a levels were significantly lower in the 3dAT group than in controls and trended lower than in the myotubes subjected to daily bouts of cyclic strain (Fig. 3f). The data suggest that FoxO3a levels are elevated, and the proportion of dephosphorylated FoxO3a and thus activated FoxO3a is upregulated with when daily bouts of cyclic stretch are removed. Catabolic, inflammatory signaling in response to daily cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch In order to understand whether the cessation of cyclic strain and subsequent atrophy was linked with catabolic, inflammatory signaling, we interrogated three canonical inflammatory proteins that contribute to skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during unloading. For this purpose, we measured myotube levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as the p65 subunit of the pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Protein abundance detected through immunoblotting revealed no statistical difference in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 among myotubes subjected to no stretch, 2 days of cyclic stretch, and 5 days of cyclic stretch (Fig. 4). However, there was a 2–3 fold increase in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 compared with 2dHY, 5dHY, and the no stretch controls, similar to the pattern observed in total FoxO3a levels. These data suggest a significant role of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB in myotube atrophy following the removal of daily bouts of cyclic stretch.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In the current study, we examined the efficacy of the application and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a prospective bioreactor for use in spaceflight research. The uniaxial cyclic stretch produced tensile loading on myotubes with some shear in anchoring interface with laminin on the dish or membrane. Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an ‘off-transient’ period that our data suggest mimics unloading-microgravity. The cyclic stretch protocol (12% sinusoidal stretch, 0.7 Hz waveform frequency, 1 hour/day) over 2 and 5 days produced marked hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes, accompanied by elevated anabolic markers (talin, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308). In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB subunit p65) as well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). A discussion of the physiological and technological development relevance follows. These findings have a number of parallels with the data published by Soltow, et al. (2013)35 using the FlexCell® as a model for overloading and unloading (e.g., microgravity). The FlexCell®’s 2 days cyclic stretching protocol (12%, 0.7 Hz,1 h/d) using collagen-coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels, Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In contrast, 48 h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphorylation, thus activating pro-inflammatory and muscle atrophic signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter. These data suggest that uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and decreased mechanical loading. In contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate microgravity conditions. These bioreactors create a three-dimensional culture environment with low shear forces, mimicking some aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not effective in inducing the primary consequence of weightlessness on skeletal muscles, which is a dramatically reduced tensile load. Furthermore, centrifugation adds compressive stress to alleviate microgravity, a far different loading profile that skeletal muscles and attached tendons experience (e.g., tension along the long axis) in a terrestrial environment. Increased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle fibers promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis and altering protein degradation, thus initiating muscle hypertrophy40–42. Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation35,43,44. In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading on myotubes, which resulted in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter and size, confirming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits hypertrophy of the muscle fibers (Fig. 1). Overloading produced by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy, including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. For example, the overexpression of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube hypertrophy47. Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK-134 relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation (deactivation) and decrease in FoxO3a phosphorylation (activation)5. Withdrawal and cessation of the cyclic stretching protocol affect skeletal muscle myotubes producing mechanical unloading alterations. Using the StrexCell system to release from daily cyclic stretch, C2C12 myotubes underwent a significant reduction in myotube size after 3 days cessation of cyclic stretch (Fig. 1). A rapid reduction in skeletal muscle size mimics the muscle disuse atrophy that occurs with mechanical unloading4,6,35. Indeed, mechanical unloading and spaceflight lead to both a suppression of anabolic signaling and an elevation of proteolytic pathways, thus leading to muscle fiber atrophy1,12. FoxO3a is an atrophy-associated transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus in its active form during skeletal muscle unloading. Indeed, nuclear accumulation of active FoxO3a is the atrophy-associated transcription factor FoxO3a is linked to muscle atrophy48,49. In our StrexCell protocol, withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to increased levels of unphosphorylated (i.e., active) FoxO3a, consistent with protein degradation’s role in muscle atrophy (Fig. 3). The total amount of FoxO3a was nearly tripled, also suggesting potential stimulation of catabolic signaling. There was a smaller 40% increase in phosphorylated Foxo3a. thus was a statistically significant decrease (more than 50%) in the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio, consistent with greater potential for rapid protein degradation and myotube fiber atrophy. Notably, spaceflight microgravity lowered the Akt activity pathway by downregulating the eIF4/p70S6K signaling50. Furthermore, Bodine and Baehr (2014)51 reported that the FoxO3a transcription factor regulates the MuRF1 and MAFbx expression involved in the protein degradation process leading to muscle atrophy52. Akt activation is a well-known causal regulator of protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. Downregulation of the Akt activation pathway, which is associated with dephosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1, has been consistently reported in muscle atrophy53–55. Our laboratory previously reported downregulation of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in response the mechanical unloading, prevented by EUK-134 an antioxidant mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase8. In this study, Akt phosphorylation was significantly decreased when daily cyclic stretch was withdrawn for three days. This observation would be consistent with reduced protein synthesis and thus muscle atrophy. Simultaneous activation of FoxO3a and suppression of an Akt-mTOR pathways with skeletal muscle wasting, including mechanical unloading has been a frequent observation12,40,46,56–58. Indeed, historical and recent studies have consistently documented increased proteolysis59 coupled with decreased skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to hindlimb unloading of hindlimb muscles13,60. Furthermore, we previously documented greater dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, accompanied by downregulation of an Akt-mTOR pathway with unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy8. This is consistent with the argument that dephosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO3a and thus enhance proteolysis during unloading-induced atrophy8,61. Integration of Akt1 and FoxO3a signaling illustrated the role of Akt in simultaneously regulating muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation62. Various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by cytokines, inflammatory transcription factors, and inflammatory substrates have been implicated in muscle atrophy by affecting muscle protein turnover or myonuclear turnover63,64. Unloading-induced muscle atrophy has been consistently linked to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1-beta (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)65. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-κB) is often elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to the atrophy process12. We found that the inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-6 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days (Fig. 4). The large magnitude of upregulation for IL-2, IL-6, and p65 while myotubes were in a humoral free medium clearly indicated that circulating cytokines and endocrine factors could not exclusively account for the marked elevation of inflammatory signaling. Indeed, these data support the hypothesis that much of inflammatory medication in unloaded muscle fibers could be localized within the muscle fibers. Therefore, upregulation of inflammatory mediators during the loading period must be a result of mechanosensing within the myotubes, rather than circulatory factors. Physiologically, a 2–3 fold elevation of IL-1ß and IL-6 would be expected to stimulate pro-inflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, protein degradation, and muscle atrophy66. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy are not surprisingly characterized by increased levels of IL-1ß and IL-667,68. Given that IL-1ß and IL-6 can activate or be activated by NF-κB57, thus it was expected that NF-kappaB subunit p65 would also upregulated following cessation of daily cyclic stretch (Fig. 4C). NF-κB has previously found to be involved in mechanical unloading-induced muscle atrophy69–71. Upregulation of NF-κB, IL-1ß, and IL-6 can lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3 phosphorylation, consistent with a shift toward catabolic signaling72. Therefore, it is likely that the large elevation of IL-1ß, IL-5, and p65 contributed to suppression of anabolism, elevation of catabolic signaling, and thus atrophy of the myotubes. This study has some limitations, while the unloaded/microgravity model was not free floating we argue that there is a tradeoff is being able to induce cyclic tensile strain and release of cyclic stretch bouts as a reasonable simulation of the unloading of microgravity. Skeletal muscles are complex tissues that generate tensile forces to produce body movement and stability. Muscles adapt to changes in tensile loading by adjusting their mass and cross-sectional area. When mechanical tensile loading is diminished or absent in vivo (e.g., spaceflight, casting, bedrest) during periods of immobility or inactivity, muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased in response. Even with the limitations outlined above, myotubes in this study responded significantly to bouts of cycle stretch by myotube hypertrophy and underwent atrophy when unloaded. Thus, our StrexCell model of increased and release of tensile loading resulted in biological responses that would be predictable given the physiological responses to overloading and unloading in vivo. While tensile loading produces stretch on the myotubes, there is a limitation of a lack of contractile activity during stretch. Indeed, StrexCell modules may not fully mimic resistive training bouts, and there could be significant differences in mechanosensing, Ca2+ homeostasis, etc. the response of calpains to both loading and unloading recapitulate in vivo responses to exercise and disuse (Hyatt & Powers 2020). In addition, anabolic, catabolic, and inflammatory responses would be predictable and consistent with in vivo loading and unloading data. While calpain activity is accepted as an important indicator of cellular Ca2+ overload, we were unable to measure cellular Ca2+ directly, using a fluorescence probe (e.g., fluo-4), We will measure [Ca2+] levels in future as well as additional, important markers of Ca2+ overload such as SERCA1, SERCA2a, sarcolipin, etc. In conclusion the development of a uniaxial bioreactor for skeletal muscle will assist future studies, on the ground and during spaceflight, to elucidate mechanisms that cause skeletal muscle atrophy and remodeling during spaceflight. In addition, the StrexCell bioreactor would allow direct testing of countermeasure strategies against the adverse effects of spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation. In this study, we tested and developed an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading and microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell uniaxial stretch system. The withdrawal of cyclic stretch was used to demonstrate that mechanical inactivity turns off signaling for muscle hypertrophy, while elevating pro-inflammatory, pro-catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation, thus causing myotube atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that the StrexCell uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study spaceflight and re- (over)loading in skeletal muscle cells.",

Copyright notice ID: 11167039 PMID: 38862543 Abstract Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch. Subject terms: Cell biology, PhysiologyIntroduction Mitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight requires a better mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to Mars and the moon. Extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. The microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness1–4. Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue4–8. Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASA’s long-term mission objectives. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading9,10. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments11–15. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers16,17. In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross-sectional area4,6. A common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein18–20. However, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity21, disuse22, cancer23, and aging24 compromises physical function and systemic health. Rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceflight microgravity conditions25–27. These bioreactors produce a low-shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain aspects of weightlessness27. However, they are not suitable for inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle fibers experience during exercise in spaceflight. Although tumbler bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation, they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise. Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through muscle fibers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium)28. Skeletal muscles are organized as multinucleated myofibers, whose function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis. Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area29,30, and shifting the % of slow-twitch fibers31,32. Unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased protein anabolism8. In addition, there is an increase in connective tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well33. Thus, maintaining mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes) to simulate spaceflight or exercise during spaceflight should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels bioreactors. Ergo, to study the physiological responses of skeletal muscle fibers to tensile loading, myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin-coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses34. Based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial loading35. Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system fitted that includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myotubes36,37 as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry into gravitational environments.Results Myotube morphology in response to cyclic stretch, cessation of daily stretch To study the effects of cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch on skeletal muscle myotube morphology and size, we used C2C12 mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on laminin. β-sarcoglycan immunofluorescence positive staining was used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy (Fig. 1). Confocal immunofluorescence quantification revealed a significant increase of 51% and 94% in mean myotube diameter following 2 and 5 days of a cyclic stretch, compared to the 2-day and 5-day quiescent controls, respectively (Fig. 1b). When myotubes underwent three days without cyclic stretch in myotubes, following 2 days of cyclic stretch, then myotube diameter was 32% lower compared to the loaded, stretched myotubes (Fig. 1b). Quantification of the total nuclei population per field revealed a significant reduction as a result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls (Fig. 1c), indicating an increase in fiber size while the nuclear number was relatively static. The fusion index was found to be increased significantly by the 2, and 5 days stretching protocol compared with quiescent controls (Fig. 1d). However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT), did not alter the fusion index compared to the 2 days cyclic stretching. Fig. 1.

Protein abundance of the focal adhesion complex and cytoskeletal protein talin was chosen as a muscle hypertrophy marker, while the activity of calpains was chosen as a proteolytic marker (Fig. 2). Our findings revealed that both 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching significantly elevated the levels of talin protein compared to the control levels (Fig. 2a). There was no statistically significant difference between 2 and 5 days of stretch on talin protein levels. Fig. 2. Markers of protein turnover: Talin protein levels and calpain activity assay.

Protein abundance quantification was determined using Western immunoblotting with Ponceau stain as a protein loading control and quantified using ImageJ for talin. b Calpain Activity is expressed as fluorogenic values (RFU/mg/min). Myotubes were divided into the following groups (n = 4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). (a) = statistically significant difference from no-stretch (2d); (b) = significantly different than 2dHY; (c) = significantly different than 5dHY. (p ≤ 0.05) Values are presented as Box plots ±SD. The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line.However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT) resulted in a significantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5 days of daily cyclic stretch. Talin protein levels were not statistically different from quiescent myotubes that experienced no daily stress and strain due to stretch. In contrast, calpain activity that was measured by fluorescence revealed a significant increase in activity in the 2dHY and 5dHY groups, indicating that daily bouts of cyclic stretch elevated calpain levels and presumably remodeling (Fig. 2b). Myotubes that completed stretch cessation myotubes displayed calpain levels that were not statistically different than the no-stretch and 2dHY groups. Calpain activity was significantly lower in the 3dAT group vs. 5dHY myotubes.Akt and Foxo3a signaling is altered by cyclic stretch and removal of cyclic stretch The Akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. To reveal the effects of daily cyclic stretch and subsequent cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch, we measured total Akt, phosphorylated Akt at Thr308, total protein levels for FoxO3a, phosphorylated FoxO3a, and the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio (Fig. 3). Our data revealed that phosphorylated Akt levels were elevated after daily bouts of cyclic stretch (Fig. 4b). The phosphorylated Akt to total Akt activity ratio trended upwards with 2 days of a daily cyclic stretch but was not different from than controls (Fig. 3c). Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in 3dAT than in 2dHY but were no different than controls (Fig. 3b). pAkt/total Akt for 3dAT was similar to the no stretch control group. Fig. 3.

The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line.The FoxO3a transcription factor can be phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt phosphorylation or conversely dephosphorylated and stimulated by pro-inflammatory signaling. Total protein levels for FoxO3a were elevated by almost 3-fold after cessation of daily cyclic stretch compared with the no stretch, 2dHY and 5dHY groups (Fig. 3d). However, the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a levels were significantly lower in the 3dAT group than in controls and trended lower than in the myotubes subjected to daily bouts of cyclic strain (Fig. 3f). The data suggest that FoxO3a levels are elevated, and the proportion of dephosphorylated FoxO3a and thus activated FoxO3a is upregulated with when daily bouts of cyclic stretch are removed.Catabolic, inflammatory signaling in response to daily cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch In order to understand whether the cessation of cyclic strain and subsequent atrophy was linked with catabolic, inflammatory signaling, we interrogated three canonical inflammatory proteins that contribute to skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during unloading. For this purpose, we measured myotube levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as the p65 subunit of the pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Protein abundance detected through immunoblotting revealed no statistical difference in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 among myotubes subjected to no stretch, 2 days of cyclic stretch, and 5 days of cyclic stretch (Fig. 4). However, there was a 2–3 fold increase in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 compared with 2dHY, 5dHY, and the no stretch controls, similar to the pattern observed in total FoxO3a levels. These data suggest a significant role of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB in myotube atrophy following the removal of daily bouts of cyclic stretch.Discussion In the current study, we examined the efficacy of the application and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a prospective bioreactor for use in spaceflight research. The uniaxial cyclic stretch produced tensile loading on myotubes with some shear in anchoring interface with laminin on the dish or membrane. Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an ‘off-transient’ period that our data suggest mimics unloading-microgravity. The cyclic stretch protocol (12% sinusoidal stretch, 0.7 Hz waveform frequency, 1 hour/day) over 2 and 5 days produced marked hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes, accompanied by elevated anabolic markers (talin, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308). In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB subunit p65) as well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). A discussion of the physiological and technological development relevance follows. These findings have a number of parallels with the data published by Soltow, et al. (2013)35 using the FlexCell® as a model for overloading and unloading (e.g., microgravity). The FlexCell®’s 2 days cyclic stretching protocol (12%, 0.7 Hz,1 h/d) using collagen-coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels, Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In contrast, 48 h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphorylation, thus activating pro-inflammatory and muscle atrophic signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter. These data suggest that uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and decreased mechanical loading. In contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate microgravity conditions. These bioreactors create a three-dimensional culture environment with low shear forces, mimicking some aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not effective in inducing the primary consequence of weightlessness on skeletal muscles, which is a dramatically reduced tensile load. Furthermore, centrifugation adds compressive stress to alleviate microgravity, a far different loading profile that skeletal muscles and attached tendons experience (e.g., tension along the long axis) in a terrestrial environment. Increased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle fibers promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis and altering protein degradation, thus initiating muscle hypertrophy40–42. Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation35,43,44. In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading on myotubes, which resulted in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter and size, confirming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits hypertrophy of the muscle fibers (Fig. 1). Overloading produced by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy, including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. For example, the overexpression of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube hypertrophy47. Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK-134 relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation (deactivation) and decrease in FoxO3a phosphorylation (activation)5. Withdrawal and cessation of the cyclic stretching protocol affect skeletal muscle myotubes producing mechanical unloading alterations. Using the StrexCell system to release from daily cyclic stretch, C2C12 myotubes underwent a significant reduction in myotube size after 3 days cessation of cyclic stretch (Fig. 1). A rapid reduction in skeletal muscle size mimics the muscle disuse atrophy that occurs with mechanical unloading4,6,35. Indeed, mechanical unloading and spaceflight lead to both a suppression of anabolic signaling and an elevation of proteolytic pathways, thus leading to muscle fiber atrophy1,12. FoxO3a is an atrophy-associated transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus in its active form during skeletal muscle unloading. Indeed, nuclear accumulation of active FoxO3a is the atrophy-associated transcription factor FoxO3a is linked to muscle atrophy48,49. In our StrexCell protocol, withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to increased levels of unphosphorylated (i.e., active) FoxO3a, consistent with protein degradation’s role in muscle atrophy (Fig. 3). The total amount of FoxO3a was nearly tripled, also suggesting potential stimulation of catabolic signaling. There was a smaller 40% increase in phosphorylated Foxo3a. thus was a statistically significant decrease (more than 50%) in the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio, consistent with greater potential for rapid protein degradation and myotube fiber atrophy. Notably, spaceflight microgravity lowered the Akt activity pathway by downregulating the eIF4/p70S6K signaling50. Furthermore, Bodine and Baehr (2014)51 reported that the FoxO3a transcription factor regulates the MuRF1 and MAFbx expression involved in the protein degradation process leading to muscle atrophy52. Akt activation is a well-known causal regulator of protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. Downregulation of the Akt activation pathway, which is associated with dephosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1, has been consistently reported in muscle atrophy53–55. Our laboratory previously reported downregulation of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in response the mechanical unloading, prevented by EUK-134 an antioxidant mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase8. In this study, Akt phosphorylation was significantly decreased when daily cyclic stretch was withdrawn for three days. This observation would be consistent with reduced protein synthesis and thus muscle atrophy. Simultaneous activation of FoxO3a and suppression of an Akt-mTOR pathways with skeletal muscle wasting, including mechanical unloading has been a frequent observation12,40,46,56–58. Indeed, historical and recent studies have consistently documented increased proteolysis59 coupled with decreased skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to hindlimb unloading of hindlimb muscles13,60. Furthermore, we previously documented greater dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, accompanied by downregulation of an Akt-mTOR pathway with unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy8. This is consistent with the argument that dephosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO3a and thus enhance proteolysis during unloading-induced atrophy8,61. Integration of Akt1 and FoxO3a signaling illustrated the role of Akt in simultaneously regulating muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation62. Various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by cytokines, inflammatory transcription factors, and inflammatory substrates have been implicated in muscle atrophy by affecting muscle protein turnover or myonuclear turnover63,64. Unloading-induced muscle atrophy has been consistently linked to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1-beta (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)65. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-κB) is often elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to the atrophy process12. We found that the inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-6 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days (Fig. 4). The large magnitude of upregulation for IL-2, IL-6, and p65 while myotubes were in a humoral free medium clearly indicated that circulating cytokines and endocrine factors could not exclusively account for the marked elevation of inflammatory signaling. Indeed, these data support the hypothesis that much of inflammatory medication in unloaded muscle fibers could be localized within the muscle fibers. Therefore, upregulation of inflammatory mediators during the loading period must be a result of mechanosensing within the myotubes, rather than circulatory factors. Physiologically, a 2–3 fold elevation of IL-1ß and IL-6 would be expected to stimulate pro-inflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, protein degradation, and muscle atrophy66. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy are not surprisingly characterized by increased levels of IL-1ß and IL-667,68. Given that IL-1ß and IL-6 can activate or be activated by NF-κB57, thus it was expected that NF-kappaB subunit p65 would also upregulated following cessation of daily cyclic stretch (Fig. 4C). NF-κB has previously found to be involved in mechanical unloading-induced muscle atrophy69–71. Upregulation of NF-κB, IL-1ß, and IL-6 can lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3 phosphorylation, consistent with a shift toward catabolic signaling72. Therefore, it is likely that the large elevation of IL-1ß, IL-5, and p65 contributed to suppression of anabolism, elevation of catabolic signaling, and thus atrophy of the myotubes. This study has some limitations, while the unloaded/microgravity model was not free floating we argue that there is a tradeoff is being able to induce cyclic tensile strain and release of cyclic stretch bouts as a reasonable simulation of the unloading of microgravity. Skeletal muscles are complex tissues that generate tensile forces to produce body movement and stability. Muscles adapt to changes in tensile loading by adjusting their mass and cross-sectional area. When mechanical tensile loading is diminished or absent in vivo (e.g., spaceflight, casting, bedrest) during periods of immobility or inactivity, muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased in response. Even with the limitations outlined above, myotubes in this study responded significantly to bouts of cycle stretch by myotube hypertrophy and underwent atrophy when unloaded. Thus, our StrexCell model of increased and release of tensile loading resulted in biological responses that would be predictable given the physiological responses to overloading and unloading in vivo. While tensile loading produces stretch on the myotubes, there is a limitation of a lack of contractile activity during stretch. Indeed, StrexCell modules may not fully mimic resistive training bouts, and there could be significant differences in mechanosensing, Ca2+ homeostasis, etc. the response of calpains to both loading and unloading recapitulate in vivo responses to exercise and disuse (Hyatt & Powers 2020). In addition, anabolic, catabolic, and inflammatory responses would be predictable and consistent with in vivo loading and unloading data. While calpain activity is accepted as an important indicator of cellular Ca2+ overload, we were unable to measure cellular Ca2+ directly, using a fluorescence probe (e.g., fluo-4), We will measure [Ca2+] levels in future as well as additional, important markers of Ca2+ overload such as SERCA1, SERCA2a, sarcolipin, etc. In conclusion the development of a uniaxial bioreactor for skeletal muscle will assist future studies, on the ground and during spaceflight, to elucidate mechanisms that cause skeletal muscle atrophy and remodeling during spaceflight. In addition, the StrexCell bioreactor would allow direct testing of countermeasure strategies against the adverse effects of spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation. In this study, we tested and developed an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading and microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell uniaxial stretch system. The withdrawal of cyclic stretch was used to demonstrate that mechanical inactivity turns off signaling for muscle hypertrophy, while elevating pro-inflammatory, pro-catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation, thus causing myotube atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that the StrexCell uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study spaceflight and re- (over)loading in skeletal muscle cells.Methods Cell culture proliferation and differential protocol We used a commonly used immortal cell line (C2C12) (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA) derived from mouse skeletal muscle, generously provide by Dr. James Fluckey’s Muscle Biology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. C2C12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber filled with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, growth medium (DMEM + NA Pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO235,73. Once the myoblast cultures reached 60–65% confluency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized and re-cultured in 4 well-2 cm2 silicone chambers coated by laminin at 37 °C and 5% CO2, using 1 ml per well. Once the cells reached 70–80% confluency, myotube differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium DMEM (-) NA Pyruvate, supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% insulin-transferrin-selenium. To study the effects of increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes, we maintained myotubes on laminin-coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a StrexCell® system, then observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses34. Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the myotube silicone chambers were exposed to the uniaxial stretching using the StrexCell® unit. The differentiation medium was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions.StrexCell loading and unloading protocol Cyclic stretch of skeletal muscle cell cultures or “myotubes” has been used to mimic the loading pattern of skeletal muscle-induced hypertrophy and atrophy74. However, several limitations for the FlexCell system that could impair compatibility for research in spaceflight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum pump, considerable weight, and difficulty generating true uniaxial stretch. StrexCell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer-controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low frequencies of 1–20%. Myoblasts and myotubes on a StrexCell system were exposed to uniaxial stress/tensile loads and release of tensile loading. While the myotubes were not free floating, they are plated on laminin that simulates the extracellular matrix/endothelium normally attached to muscle fibers surrounding myocytes. The myoblast and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium, which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level, gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion affinity, intermolecular forces, and fluid dynamics, especially in an aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotubes. Importantly, adhesion to laminin allows controlled levels of uniaxial stretch to be exercise on myotubes that simulates tensile loading in an aqueous environment. We used a StrexCell® STB-1400 (B-Bridge International, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) to apply a cyclic uniaxial stretch on C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 5a). The stretch instrument employs a computer-controlled stepper motor to drive two metal frames apart. A flexible silicone chamber was attached to both frames, and the chamber was stretched and released in a programmable sinusoidal oscillation. STB-1400 includes a 10 cm2 stretch chamber model (Culture area: 3.2 × 3.2 × 1.0 cm), which supports up to 6 chambers simultaneously. The C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in silicon stretch chambers coated with laminin (Fig. 5a). The amount of strain experienced by the myotubes was measured as the percent change in the stretch from the starting position (Fig. 5b). Based on the preliminary validation experiments and the published report of Soltow, et al. (2013)35, the strain program was set at 0.7 Hz frequency, 12% stretch using a sinusoidal wave pattern for 1 hour/day for 2 or 5 days. Exposure to the uniaxial cyclic stretching was utilized to induce hypertrophy with increased loading. Conversely, cyclic stretch cessation was deemed off-transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy release of cyclic tensile loads, with replicate control cultures maintained under quiescent conditions with no applied cyclic strain.

Five different groups were assigned (n = 4/group): (a) 2 days no stretch controls (no Stretch 2d), (b) 5 days no Stretch controls (no Stretch 5d), (c) 2 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) (2dHY), (d) 5 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) (5dHY), (e) 2 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) + 3 days cessation of stretching (3dAT). Myotubes cultures were collected at the end of each group protocol to be fixed for immunofluorescence imaging or homogenized using lysis buffer for western blot analysis.Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy Immunofluorescence imaging was performed to observe cell morphology. C2C12 myotubes were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the myotubes were washed three times with 1X PBS. Cell membranes were solubilized for intracellular assays using a 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 3 min until washed with 1X PBS. Myotubes were blocked with 1X PBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 5% goat serum for 30 min at RT. Myotubes were then incubated with β-sarcoglycan (membrane marker) primary antibody (1:200 β-sarcoglycan mouse mAb, abcam, Cat # ab55683) for 1 h at RT, and subsequently washed with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min). Myotubes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:250 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Flour 488, ThermoFisher, Cat # A-11029) for 1 h at RT, followed by washing with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then counterstaining with 1 µg/µl DAPI. After washing with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then double-distilled water (2 × 5 min), slides were mounted with antifade mounting medium (ProLong™ Gold Antifade, Invitrogen, cat # P36930). Myotubes immunofluorescence staining was visualized using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP8 Confocal Lightning GPU-based Deconvolution (20X, zoom 2.25, emission wavelength 450–500 nm) in the Texas A&M Image Analysis Core Laboratory. Images were analyzed using Leica LAS X software v.4.3 and  ImageJ (Fiji. ImageJ v.1.53k) software for fiber diameter assessment and nucleus quantification.Western immunoblot Protein abundance was as described by Lawler et al. (2021)4 and determined by Western immunoblot analysis. The whole-cell lysate was collected using TRIS HCL lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector). Twenty µg of protein samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at 120 V for 75 min using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel box onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad: Hercules, CA). The membranes were then blocked in a non-fat milk buffer (5% non-fat milk in TBS) for 1 h. Following blocking, membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) in a blocking buffer with the appropriate primary antibodies: Anabolic signaling (anti-total Akt (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4691 S), anti-Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (rabbit pAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 9271 S), anti-Talin (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4021); Catabolic signaling with anti-Foxo3a (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 12829 S) and anti-phospho-Foxo3a at Ser473 (rabbit pAb; 1:300; Cell Signaling Cat# 9464 L); inflammatory markers anti-IL-1β (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12703), anti-IL-6 (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12912), and anti-P65 (mouse mAb; 1:500; abcam, Cat# ab32536). Then, the membranes were washed with T-TBS (3 × 5 min) and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad, cat# 1705061) enhanced chemiluminescence detection and developed using a Cytiva Amersham ImageQuant™ 800 Western Blot Imaging System (Cytiva). Quantification was performed by ImageQuant™ TL10 v.10.2 and  ImageJ software with Ponceau-S staining serving as a loading control.Calpain activity Calpain activity was performed using a Calpain Activity Assay Fluorometric Kit (Abcam # ab65308) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 20 µg of the whole-cell lysate (mixed with lysis buffer provided with the kit). Calpain activities for each sample were expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFUs) per milligram of protein per minute (RFU/μg/min). The fluorescence signal was detected at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector).Statistical approach Results were collected and processed for statistical analysis using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). One-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was performed to distinguish among group mean differences and between the different variables with significance set at P < 0.05. A nested ANOVA design was used to quantify myotube diameter.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Reporting Summary (89.2KB, pdf) Acknowledgements The authors thank all the Redox Biology & Cell Signaling Laboratory members for their technical support.

    "abstract": "Abstract Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia. Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora. Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum. Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current  references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction A clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands. As a result, the U.S. Water Recovery System (WRS) was launched to the ISS in 2008 with the goal of generating potable water from urine distillate, humidity condensate, and Sabatier product water, as well as the occasional off-loading of ground-supplied water [1]. The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [2]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA (Fig. 1). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics. The DA functions under a vacuum to reduce the heat required to reach boiling point. Following distillation, UPA flex line 115 (UPA115) carries water vapor to the purge pump, where condensation occurs prior to collection for further processing by the WPA [4] (Fig. 1). The urine brine is transferred from the DA by UPA flex line 95 (UPA95) into the recycling tank (Fig. 1). The recycling tank accumulates brine, and current technology demonstrations onboard the ISS are achieving further water recovery by processing the brine [5]. Based on the current system, a maximum of 87% of the water from urine is removed and processed for downstream potable needs. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Urine Processor Assembly schematic detailing the positions of the two flex line hoses (UPA95 and UPA115) (Fig. S3). Modified from Carter et al, 2011 [3]. Upon departing the UPA, the condensed water enters the WPA wastewater tank, which does not have a validated means of microbial control. As such, approximately a year after being put into operation, the flow of water from this tank decreased due to an obstructing biofilm [1]. Biofouling within the ISS water system presents a significant risk to both vehicle and crew health. Biofilms can block lines and restrict access to clean water. Should pathogens be present, the risk of crew infection dramatically increases. Additionally, the persistence of biofilms can result in corrosion, overall materials degradation, and a failed water system. For these reasons, as a remedy to the biofilm noted downstream of the wastewater tank, additional filtration was added. While this water is examined periodically, the microbial profiles are determined after return of samples to Earth. The time in-between sample collection and analysis, and the lack of preservation, results in a skewed representation of the microbial population. The wastewater tank likely contains a thriving microbial community, but low diversity is noted upon ground evaluation, and no insight is gained toward the presence of possible biofilms. It is critical to enhance our understanding toward the microbial profiles, as well as associated biofilm potential, within the existing ISS WRS to the fullest extent to prepare for the next generation of spaceflight water systems. Catalytic oxidation, filtration, and the addition of a biocide during WPA processing serve to substantially reduce microbial contamination in the potable water. This water is held to stringent acceptability limits: 50 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total bacteria and no detectable coliforms per 100 mL [6]. The presence of coliforms is assessed monthly, while total bacteria are evaluated every quarter. There has never been a true positive coliform detected, and apart from the early checkout process, the levels of culturable bacteria are well below the requirement. However, following assessments of the wastewater tank, solenoid valve crevices, and filter mesh for the U.S. and Russian water systems, increased microbial levels have been noted [7]. To survey the unique microbial community that is present in the water from the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD), the crew filters and cultures the bacteria onboard the ISS, then returns them to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Microbiology Laboratory for identification via partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing [6]. These techniques can determine both the overall bacterial levels (through in-flight colony counting) and the identification of culturable taxa. Typically, the level of bacteria is in the range of a few CFUs per ml. The bacterial genera routinely include common water contaminants such as Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Curvibacter, Cupriavidus, Sphingobium, and, frequently, other Gram-negative organisms that cannot be identified through the laboratory’s standard methods. As mentioned, the present method has important limitations, including the length of time between sample collection on orbit and subsequent analysis and possible degradation during transport from the ISS to the laboratory. Therefore, understanding of the actual microbial profiles within these systems would be enhanced by near real-time monitoring capabilities. Previous work has already demonstrated that sequencing in space is possible and can be performed with identical outcomes to those on the ground [[8], [9], [10]]. This shift in paradigm from Earth-based to spaceflight-based analysis has implications for a broad range of other molecular applications onboard the ISS, including water monitoring. Future NASA Programs such as Gateway, a lunar outpost allowing greater access to the lunar surface and a staging point for Mars missions, is expected to have a water recovery and recycling system. However, current planning anticipates Gateway will be unoccupied for up to 11 months per year, resulting in a dormant wetted, water system. A means of microbial control is paramount to this future system. NASA has initiated a robust anti-biofouling program in which many teams are investigating a diverse means of biofilm prevention and mitigation, but the organisms to use in these varied investigations are extremely limited. This coupled with a lack of insight beyond returned PWD and WPA wastewater tank samples, drove pursuing of the opportunity to microbially characterize UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines during refurbishment. The work described here aims to characterize the microorganisms found in the returned UPA flex lines and potentially identify the hosing positions as novel areas of interest for biofilm growth studies in the system. The current WRS employs numerous hosing connections with materials and sizes defined by the initial architecture plan. Determining potential microbial impacts regarding the WRS hosing will enable further engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention.",

Identification of microbial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines Three bacteria and one fungus were recovered from UPA95, while six bacteria and two fungi were recovered from UPA115, as detailed in Table 1. The three bacteria from UPA95 were all found to be Burkholderia species by Sanger sequencing but revealed distinct colony morphologies. Isolate 3.1 Burkholderia sp. colonies were milky white, isolate 3.2 Burkholderia sp. colonies were yellow, while isolate 3.3 B. fungorum colonies were smooth and white in appearance. The fungal isolate F3.1 was identified as a Fusarium sp. From UPA115, isolate 4.1 demonstrated rough, white colonies that were identified as B. fungorum. Additionally, three different Burkholderia morphologies were noted. Isolate 4.2 was white, whereas isolate 4.3 was yellow and isolate 4.5 was wet in appearance. The Burkholderia sp. 4.5 wet morphology was not noted from UPA95 and the two B. fungorum displayed different morphologies. Isolate 4.4 was a Gram-positive bacterium but could not be identified to the genus level. Isolate 5.2 was determined to be Leifsonia lichenia. The two fungal isolates from UPA115 were 4.1 Fusarium sp. and 4.2 Lecythophora mutabilis. Table 1. Culture-based identifications from UPA95 and UPA115 flex line hoses isolates via Sanger sequencing.

Leifsonia lichenia Open in a new tabIt is not unexpected that a higher diversity of organisms was recovered from UPA115 as compared to UPA95, as UPA95 experiences a higher concentration and prolonged exposure of the urine pre-treat solution during the recycling of the brine, as noted in Table 2. Bacterial isolate identification corresponds with historical data, as Burkholderia sp. is one of the most dominant bacterial genera recovered from the PWD and wastewater tank onboard the ISS [[30], [31], [32]]. The high prevalence of Burkholderia sp. is likely due to their resistance capabilities toward a broad range of metals [33,34] Historically, unidentified Gram-positive organisms and L. lichenia have been noted in samples returned from the ISS, but more common is the isolation of unidentified Gram-negative organisms. It is unclear if these bacteria survived the pre-treat solution or are part of the population downstream of the DA. While attempts are made to launch microbially-clean hardware for use onboard the ISS, hardware is not launched sterile. The recovered fungus, L. mutabilis, has been isolated by the JSC Microbiology Laboratory from returned wastewater (JSC archive, data not shown) and has also been noted from a filter within the WRS [30,31]. Fusarium sp. have been documented in the ISS environment, and it has associated with plant disease within the VEGGIE plant payload [35]. However, to the best of our knowledge, Fusarium sp. have not previously been isolated from any returned PWD or wastewater samples from the ISS. Table 2.

Culture-independent, 16S nanopore-generated microbial profiles A culture-independent method that is currently being used onboard the ISS for bacterial surface monitoring [9] was applied to the remaining volume of flush water not consumed by other evaluations. Greater diversity was noted using this method compared to the culture-based data (Fig. 2). Paralleling the culture-based data, Burkholderia and Leifsonia were present, and UPA115 demonstrated overall greater diversity as compared to UPA95 (Fig. 2). Fig. 2.

Alignments were generated with minimap2 (-ax map-ont). 3.3. Full genome analysis of bacterial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 To construct their genomes, short read (Illumina) and long read (nanopore) sequencing was conducted for the nine bacterial isolates recovered from the two flex lines. Genome summary metrics are listed in Table 2. Hybrid genome assemblies range from 3.8 to 9.7 million base pairs with 3–20 contigs (Table 3). The total genome size, percent GC content, and total gene clusters were comparable to  references (Table 3). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the nine isolates ranged from 80.1 to 99.9 similarity to other genomes within . Based on these data, isolate identifications have been further defined beyond the Sanger 16S rRNA data. Isolates 3.1, 4.2, and 3.2, 4.3, and 4.5 were identified to B. contaminans, with an ANI 95.6 and 99.9 respectively [23] (Table 3). Isolates 3.3 and 4.1 were identified as Paraburkholderia fungorum, based on updated nomenclature [36]. Isolates 4.4 and 5.2 did not change and will be described as a Gram-positive bacterium, and Leifsonia lichenia, respectively, due to low ANI percentages likely resulting from low representation of these organisms’ genomes.

PS1209 81.0 Open in a new tabComplete plasmids were not observed in any of nine isolates; however, multiple gene clusters associated with plasmids were noted. This corresponds to previous research detailing the loss of plasmids as a result of co-location and evolution among species in the Burkholderia cepacia complex [37]. Additionally, this parallels preceding reports assessing other B. contaminans isolates from the ISS potable water system [38]. Plasmid loss could potentially be a response of these organisms to the environment within the ISS water system where the associated genes do not lend a competitive advantage. Expanded evaluation of the bacterial isolates that could be identified was conducted through pangenomic analysis using the genomes of P. fungorum and B. contaminans. The B. contaminans pangenome analysis resulted in 13,598 unique gene clusters across the 78  reference genomes and the 5 isolates: 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 (Fig. 3). Of the unique gene clusters, 3,720 did not have a known function from the  PGAP annotations. There was a high average geometric homogeneity index (GHI) and a functional homogeneity index (FHI) of 0.97. The high GHI of the analysis indicates that the patterns of residues within gene clusters are mostly uniform, and the high FHI in this study indicates that any differences are minimal and likely will not impact the protein products between genomes sharing unique clusters. Chromate and biofilm-related gene functions were searched for across pangenome annotations and marked in orange and yellow, respectively (Fig. 3). Biofilm gene clusters and quorum system sensor gene clusters were observed in all 83 genomes. Multiple chromate resistance and transporter protein gene clusters stood out as features that set the five isolates from this study apart from the  assemblies and from the other previously reported ISS isolates (Fig. 3, Table S1). The presence of these resistance gene clusters is not surprising and provides insight to the organism’s ability to survive the pretreatment solution within the UPA. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab A) Pangenomic analysis of the five B. contaminans isolates sequenced in this study. 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5, which are noted by pink and purple, with the 78 available assemblies from , in black, while the red denotes the previous isolates from the ISS potable water dispenser [38]. Orange text represents gene clusters associated with chromate resistance according to function. The light blue text represents gene clusters associated with biofilm formation. The details of all the B. contaminans functional genes and gene clusters can be found in Table S1. B) Pangenomic analysis of the two P. fungorium isolates 3.3 and 4.1 sequenced in this study, which are noted in teal, with 10 available assemblies from , noted in black. Here, as well as A, the orange text represents gene clusters associated with chromate resistance according to function. The details of the P. fungorium functional genes and gene clusters can be found in Table S2. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)The B. contaminans isolates from this study clustered together into two distinct groups based on amino acid similarity. The isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 (shown in pink, Fig. 3) are grouped together while other isolates 3.1 and 4.2 (shown in purple, Fig. 3) are grouped. These isolates from this investigation grouped separately from the previous ISS potable water B. contaminans assemblies (shown in red, Fig. 3) [38]. The five B. contaminans isolates from this investigation did not share any unique gene clusters that were not observed in the reference genomes. However, isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 had 42 unique gene clusters with 23 of those having identified functions. Isolates 3.1 and 4.2 had 417 unique gene clusters, with 145 of those having identified functions that were not found in the other isolate groups or genome references. Isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 had several unique gene clusters of interest related to cadmium, toxin-antitoxin, flavodoxin and hemolysin proteins (Table S1). These gene clusters could potentially be associated to the enhancement of virulence, a broad range of metal resistance, active metabolism, and high hemolytic activity [[39], [40], [41], [42]]. Moreover, the toxin-antitoxin gene clusters have been previously connected to dormancy scenarios and a persister phenotype [43,44]. For isolates 3.1 and 4.2, some unique gene clusters of interest are associated with pilin, porin, copper-binding protein, zincin, arsenate and arsenic transporter, type II and IV secretion, and type II toxin-antitoxin. These gene clusters could correspond to cell adhesion ability, molecule transport, heavy metal resistance, and toxin-antitoxin ability [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. While further evaluation into the expression and protein function is required, the differences in these gene clusters within the genome may provide insight into the morphological differences among the B. contaminans isolates. The P. fungorum pangenome analysis had 9,804 unique gene clusters across the 10  reference genomes and the two isolates: 3.3 and 4.1 (Fig. 3). Of these unique gene clusters, 2,314 did not have a known function from the PGAP annotations. The FHI was 0.97 and the GHI was 0.98. These values indicate that the gene cluster residues are uniform with a low chance of protein functional change inside unique gene clusters. Gene clusters directly associated with biofilms were not observed across these 12 genomes. However, one unique quorum sensing gene cluster and 10 unique chromate-associated gene clusters were observed across all 12 genomes. There were 371 unique gene clusters shared between the 3.3 and 4.1 isolates that were not present in the 10  references. Notably, a unique gene cluster associated with the chromate resistance protein (ChrB) was observed in both 3.3 and 4.1 but absent from the  references. It is important to note that the significant difference in the number of unique gene clusters could be due to the lower number of available references from the current database for P. fungorum. Beyond chromate, resistance associated gene clusters were also noted for copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc (Table S2). Again, while expression and protein products require further investigation, based on the genomic analysis, these organisms are likely to have tailored their genomes to support persistence within the flex line hoses. 3.4. Environmental scanning electron microscopy of UPA95 and UPA115 samples While the microbial population within the two flex lines had not previously been investigated or understood, previous biofilm-related issues within the ISS WPA resulted in questions of potential biofilms within other parts of the system. As such, samples of stagnant water within the flex lines were fixed immediately upon opening UPA95 and UPA115. Fungal biofilm networks were distinctly apparent in the samples from both flex lines (Fig. 4A, B, G, and H). However, fungal biofilm growth was more pronounced in UPA115 (Fig. 4G and H), as opposed to UPA95 (Fig. 4A and B). This observation parallels the higher microbial concentration noted from UPA115 as compared to UPA95, which is most likely due to the elevated levels of pre-treat solution in UPA95 preventing some microbial outgrowth (Table 2). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Environmental scanning electron microscopy images of water from the UPA flex lines. A – F) Samples resulting from flex line UPA95, in which high concentrations of the urine pretreatment solution are encountered. G – L) Samples resulting from flex line UPA115, in which the urine pretreatment solution is diluted as water vapor is carried to the distillation assembly. Red arrows denote potential biofilm biproducts such as EPS, yellow arrows denote bacterial cells, and blue arrows denote fungal hyphae. The increased abundance of the microbial growth displayed from the UPA115 flex lines (A and B low magnification) as compared to that noted from the UPA95 flex lines (G and H low magnification), demonstrates the more favorable and growth promoting conditions and clear fungal-bacterial biofilm formation (as also noted in higher magnification J – L) within the UPA115 flex line. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Upon magnification, present fungal hyphae were noted in various morphologies with smooth, twisted, straight, and rough surfaces revealed. Additionally, presence of bacteria on the fungal hyphae was noted at higher magnification (Fig. 4I). Bacteria and fungi interactively growing in the same environment has been investigated intensively and it is established that bacteria can grow both on and within the fungal hyphae [50]. This, along with other variables such as the presence of chemicals and/or bioproducts such as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) could explain alterations in the hyphae surface [[51], [52], [53]]. While it is unknown which organisms produced it, EPS was noted in among the images (Fig. 4C, F, 4K, 4L). Taken together, this is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. 3.5. Biofilm potential of bacterial UPA95 and UPA115 isolates To empirically evaluate biofilm potential of the flex line bacterial isolates, a traditional crystal violet assay was performed following 24, 48, and 72 h of growth. At the earliest 24-h timepoint, significantly enhanced biofilm formation was noted for B. contaminans 3.1, 3.2, and 4.2, as compared to the reference control (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this was not seen at 48 h, which could be attributed to weak cell to cell adhesion or cell communication and a longer required time for quorum sensing to regulate EPS production and stabilize biofilm structure [54]. As expected, at 72 h, more mature biofilms were present for all the isolates including the reference control. However, B. contaminans 3.1 and 4.2 displayed significantly higher biofilm production as compared to the reference (Fig. 5). While it was not surprising to see biofilm formation from Burkholderia [55,56], the production by some of the UPA isolates was notable and depicts the biofilm potential of these organisms. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of bacterial isolates from the UPA flex lines. Crystal violet intensity was evaluated at 540 nm. Isolates 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 demonstrated pronounced biofilm formation as compared to the control at 24 h. Isolates 3.1 and 4.2 also demonstrated pronounced biofilm formation as compared to the controls at 72 h (*, P < 0.05). Statistical data can be found in Table S3. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Probing the genomes for secondary metabolites revealed gene clusters associated with pyoverdin in B. contaminans 3.1 and 4.2, but not other isolates (Fig. 6). Pyoverdin production directly correlates with biofilm formation, as has been documented regarding the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [57,58]. With regard to Burkholderia, pyoverdine production has been associated with biofilm formation and pathogenicity in B. thailandensis [59]. However, the association of pyoverdin is unknown in the majority of this genera. Furthermore, the genomic data also reveal gene clusters associated with secondary metabolites involved in quorum sensing activity for all the B. contaminans and P. fungorum isolates, but not for the L. lichenia or unidentified Gram-positive bacterium (Fig. 6). The iron-binding or antifungal functional group such as occidiofungin, pyrrolnitrin, pyochelin and ornibactin are regulated by quorum sensing activity [60,61], which is major regulator of biofilm formation. Also, iron-signaling mechanisms contribute to biofilm development, which have been previously investigated with P. aeruginosa biofilms [62]. The crystal violet assay demonstrates the biofilm potential of these isolates, which corresponds with the presence of secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with biofilm production. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Gene clusters associated with known secondary metabolites from genomes from the UPA flex lines isolates identified using antiSMASH. The secondary metabolites of interest pyoverdine, occidiofungin, pyrrolnitrin, pyochelin, and ornibactin are associated with biofilm production, quorum sensing, antifungal properties, and hemolytic activity. The intensity of the color represents the completeness of the gene cluster compared to  reference. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) 3.6. Characterization of bacterial-fungal interactions and hemolytic activity Assessing phenotypic traits from monocultures benefits microbial characterization. However, the importance of investigating interactions between organisms can provide greater insight toward community dynamics and is essential to our understanding of an environment’s microbiome. Bacterial-fungal interactions can result in molecular alterations that have the potential to influence pathogenicity, biofilm formation, or morphology of the microorganisms [63]. Likely as a result of predation within their environment, B. contaminans generates protective antifungal compounds that were noted within the genomes [61,64]. Of interest were biosynthetic gene clusters associated with the secondary metabolites occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin, which were observed in B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3 genomes. Organisms within the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) synthesize the antifungal occidiofungin through a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase mechanism [65,66]. Pyrrolnitrin, also an antifungal, is a product of quorum sensing [60]. Occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin have shown antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus [67,68]. Additionally, both antifungal compounds have also been tightly associated to hemolytic activity [38,61]. Therefore, the impact of potential secondary metabolite production from all the UPA isolates on A. flavus was evaluated using three types of media under two temperatures. Hemolytic potential was also assessed. At 25 °C incubation, B. contaminans isolates 3.2, 4.3, 4.5 from both UPA flex lines generated the highest zone of inhibition on A. flavus as compared to the other isolates, including the reference control B. cepacia (Fig. 7A). Other B. contaminans 3.1, and 4.2, P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1, and B. cepacia did express the capability of inhibiting the growth of A. flavus but at a much lower intensity (Fig. 7A). This was enhanced by culture on PDA (Fig. 7A and 7B). Not unexpectedly, the growth media impacted the antagonistic effect on A. flavus, as was observed for R2A, while B. contaminans 3.1, and 4.2 and P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 did not strongly inhibit A. flavus growth (Fig. 7A). Regarding SABC, a zone of inhibition was not noted for any of the isolates, likely resulting from the interfering chloramphenicol. However, P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 showed very weak antagonistic effect, as fungal growth was observed. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab A) Bacterial-fungal interaction between UPA flex line bacterial isolates and A. flavus at two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) and three growth media (R2A, PDA and SABC). Bar plot denotes the fungal diameter while the dot plot in red displays distance. B) The interaction of A. flavus with UPA flex line bacterial isolates on PDA at 25 °C. All measurements were in triplicate for each isolate. The distance for antagonistic activity was measured between the fungal growth and bacterial deposit (red arrow). The fungal growth diameter was measured triplicate. For irregularly shaped fungal growth, the measurement was taken from three different growth directions, assuming it was a diameter (blue arrow). See Table S3 for statistical data. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)A more optimal growth temperature for bacteria, 35 °C incubation was also investigated. Generally, there was no difference in the trend of antagonistic growth toward A. flavus as compared to 25 °C incubation. The growth diameter of A. falvus did not change between the temperatures for R2A and PDA media, but more growth was noted on SABC at 35 °C (Fig. 7A.). B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3 expressed the highest antifungal capability at both temperatures and on all media assessed. The antagonistic distance was reduced at 35 °C on PDA media for B. contaminans 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5., which indicated the reduction of antifungal activity. Although there was no change in fungal growth, B. contaminans 4.5 showed much lower antagonistic distance on R2A at 35 °C. The unidentified Gram-positive 4.4 and L. lichenia 5.2. did not express observable antifungal activity toward A. flavus on any of the tested media at either temperature (Fig. 7A). The association of L. lichenia with fungi is not well established. L. xyli has exhibited plant growth promoting and low level antifungal properties against certain plant pathogens [69]. In this investigation antifungal behavior was not noted with L. lichenia, nor were known gene clusters associated with fungal inhibition present. Pyochelin biosynthesis cluster was observed in the B. contaminans 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 genomes and ornibactin gene cluster found in B. contaminans 3.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 and P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 (Fig. 6). These secondary metabolites are siderophores [70]. Although pyochelin and ornibactin are not well-known as antifungal agents secreted by Paraburkholderia and Burkholderia, they have shown their antifungal and antimicrobial activity under iron deficiency [[71], [72], [73]]. Hemolytic activity was noted for B. contaminans 4.5, which demonstrated α-hemolysis activity, while B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3. expressed strong β-hemolysis (Table S4 and Fig. S2). All other isolates displayed γ-hemolysis (no hemolytic activity) following 48 h of incubation (Table S4 and Fig. S2).",

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions The WRS has been providing potable water to astronauts onboard the ISS since 2009. However, our current understanding of the microbial community within the system is limited to the WPA wastewater tank and point-of-use PWD samples. This work represents the first investigation into the unique community that inhabits the UPA. From the UPA115 flex line, a purge line carrying water vapor to the DA, three differing morphologies of B. contaminans, as well as P. fungorum, L. lichenia, and an unidentified Gram-positive bacterium, were isolated; additionally, the fungi Fusarium sp. and L. mutabilis were isolated. Less diversity was noted from samples recovered from the UPA95 flex line, where concentrated levels of chromium are encountered, from which two different morphologies of B. contaminans, P. fungorum, and Fusarium sp. were isolated. For the five B. contaminans isolates, multiple chromate-resistance and transporter protein gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the PWD. Moreover, the UPA P. fungorum isolates contained a gene cluster associated with chromate resistance that was absent in the current  references. The acquisition of these resistance gene clusters by these organisms, as compared to both those from the WPA and terrestrial environments, distinguishes these flex lines as a unique ecological niche. Furthermore, this highlights that the flex lines, as well as other areas within the UPA, are ideal candidate areas to investigate horizontal gene transfer. As a dormant water system is a likely option for future spacecraft, e.g. the Lunar Gateway, where biofouling is a significant concern, biofilm analysis and imaging was performed. ESEM imaging of the water from the flex lines and biofilm potential of the recovered isolates demonstrated that these hoses are novel areas for fungal-bacterial biofilm growth. While NASA has a strong biofilm control campaign, the organisms used in these studies have been limited to those isolated from the WPA. Further analysis of isolates from the UPA, displaying a greater range of genetic and phenotypic properties, as well as the fungal-bacterial interactions at play within these biofilms, should be a high priority to aid in the design of engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in next generation water systems.",

Copyright notice ID: 10020673 PMID: 36938359 Abstract Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia. Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora. Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum. Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current  references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems. Keywords: Spaceflight, Biofilms, Environmental microbiology, International space station, Pangenome1. Introduction A clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands. As a result, the U.S. Water Recovery System (WRS) was launched to the ISS in 2008 with the goal of generating potable water from urine distillate, humidity condensate, and Sabatier product water, as well as the occasional off-loading of ground-supplied water [1]. The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [2]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA (Fig. 1). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics. The DA functions under a vacuum to reduce the heat required to reach boiling point. Following distillation, UPA flex line 115 (UPA115) carries water vapor to the purge pump, where condensation occurs prior to collection for further processing by the WPA [4] (Fig. 1). The urine brine is transferred from the DA by UPA flex line 95 (UPA95) into the recycling tank (Fig. 1). The recycling tank accumulates brine, and current technology demonstrations onboard the ISS are achieving further water recovery by processing the brine [5]. Based on the current system, a maximum of 87% of the water from urine is removed and processed for downstream potable needs. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Urine Processor Assembly schematic detailing the positions of the two flex line hoses (UPA95 and UPA115) (Fig. S3). Modified from Carter et al, 2011 [3].Upon departing the UPA, the condensed water enters the WPA wastewater tank, which does not have a validated means of microbial control. As such, approximately a year after being put into operation, the flow of water from this tank decreased due to an obstructing biofilm [1]. Biofouling within the ISS water system presents a significant risk to both vehicle and crew health. Biofilms can block lines and restrict access to clean water. Should pathogens be present, the risk of crew infection dramatically increases. Additionally, the persistence of biofilms can result in corrosion, overall materials degradation, and a failed water system. For these reasons, as a remedy to the biofilm noted downstream of the wastewater tank, additional filtration was added. While this water is examined periodically, the microbial profiles are determined after return of samples to Earth. The time in-between sample collection and analysis, and the lack of preservation, results in a skewed representation of the microbial population. The wastewater tank likely contains a thriving microbial community, but low diversity is noted upon ground evaluation, and no insight is gained toward the presence of possible biofilms. It is critical to enhance our understanding toward the microbial profiles, as well as associated biofilm potential, within the existing ISS WRS to the fullest extent to prepare for the next generation of spaceflight water systems. Catalytic oxidation, filtration, and the addition of a biocide during WPA processing serve to substantially reduce microbial contamination in the potable water. This water is held to stringent acceptability limits: 50 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total bacteria and no detectable coliforms per 100 mL [6]. The presence of coliforms is assessed monthly, while total bacteria are evaluated every quarter. There has never been a true positive coliform detected, and apart from the early checkout process, the levels of culturable bacteria are well below the requirement. However, following assessments of the wastewater tank, solenoid valve crevices, and filter mesh for the U.S. and Russian water systems, increased microbial levels have been noted [7]. To survey the unique microbial community that is present in the water from the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD), the crew filters and cultures the bacteria onboard the ISS, then returns them to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Microbiology Laboratory for identification via partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing [6]. These techniques can determine both the overall bacterial levels (through in-flight colony counting) and the identification of culturable taxa. Typically, the level of bacteria is in the range of a few CFUs per ml. The bacterial genera routinely include common water contaminants such as Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Curvibacter, Cupriavidus, Sphingobium, and, frequently, other Gram-negative organisms that cannot be identified through the laboratory’s standard methods. As mentioned, the present method has important limitations, including the length of time between sample collection on orbit and subsequent analysis and possible degradation during transport from the ISS to the laboratory. Therefore, understanding of the actual microbial profiles within these systems would be enhanced by near real-time monitoring capabilities. Previous work has already demonstrated that sequencing in space is possible and can be performed with identical outcomes to those on the ground [[8], [9], [10]]. This shift in paradigm from Earth-based to spaceflight-based analysis has implications for a broad range of other molecular applications onboard the ISS, including water monitoring. Future NASA Programs such as Gateway, a lunar outpost allowing greater access to the lunar surface and a staging point for Mars missions, is expected to have a water recovery and recycling system. However, current planning anticipates Gateway will be unoccupied for up to 11 months per year, resulting in a dormant wetted, water system. A means of microbial control is paramount to this future system. NASA has initiated a robust anti-biofouling program in which many teams are investigating a diverse means of biofilm prevention and mitigation, but the organisms to use in these varied investigations are extremely limited. This coupled with a lack of insight beyond returned PWD and WPA wastewater tank samples, drove pursuing of the opportunity to microbially characterize UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines during refurbishment. The work described here aims to characterize the microorganisms found in the returned UPA flex lines and potentially identify the hosing positions as novel areas of interest for biofilm growth studies in the system. The current WRS employs numerous hosing connections with materials and sizes defined by the initial architecture plan. Determining potential microbial impacts regarding the WRS hosing will enable further engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample collection and fixation The ISS UPA flex lines assessed included the recycled brine line (UPA 95” flex line 96 M 12561- 099 [UPA95]), which was installed in February 2010, and the purge line (UPA 115” flex line 96 M 12561- 100 [UPA115]) installed in May 2015 (Fig. 1). The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) flex lines transport water vapor and brine beyond the Distillation Assembly (DA) as part of the overall UPA. For refurbishment, these two flex lines were sealed with quick disconnects in October 2019 and remained onboard the ISS until their return to Earth on SpaceX-21 in January 2021. At Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), stagnant water was collected aseptically from both lines, after which the lines were flushed with 250 mL of sterile water. Visual aggregates were present in the stagnant water from UPA115 (Fig. S1). For both lines, 0.5 mL of liquid from the stagnant collection were immediately fixed for downstream environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) using a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 3% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The fixed solutions were covered in aluminum foil and kept at ambient temperature for 30 min. The fixed samples were then stored at 4 °C. These samples, as well as water samples from both flex lines, stagnant and flush, as well as the sterile flush water, were shipped on wet ice to the JSC Microbiology Laboratory for further analysis.2.2. Chromium analysis Chromium concentrations in the water removed from the flex lines were measured using a modified version of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 3125 (Metals by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) with a PerkinElmer Nexion 300D. Prior to analysis, sample and dilution tubes were soaked in 1% nitric acid for 24 h before a distilled water rinse to eliminate potential contaminants in the 15 mL and 50 mL metal-free tubes. With the expected presence of elevated chromium and the knowledge of the concentration expected from fluids associated with the UPA, the samples removed from the UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines were diluted to fall within the calibration range of the instrument and analyzed with control samples to ensure quality.2.3. Bacterial and fungal isolation and identification Upon arriving at the JSC Microbiology Laboratory, all samples, excluding those for ESEM imaging, were processed and analyzed following the laboratory’s standard operating procedures for bacterial and fungal enumeration and identification. Briefly, the samples were filtered using a Milliflex system with a Reasoner's 2A (R2A) agar cassette and a Sabouraud dextrose with chloramphenicol (SABC) cassette (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) for bacterial and fungal enumeration and isolation, respectively. In addition, serial dilutions of samples were plated on R2A and SABC plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA). All cassettes and plates were incubated for two to five days at 35 °C for bacteria and five to seven days at 30 °C for fungi. Following incubation, colonies were enumerated, and each distinct morphological colony was subcultured onto fresh media. Following growth, DNA was extracted from pure colonies representing each morphology using the PrepMan® Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (ThermoFisher) following the manufacture’s protocol. The DNA was prepared for sequencing according to the MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA PCR Kit or Fast MicroSEQ® D2 Fungal rDNA PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and associated sequencing kits, MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA Sequencing Kit or MicroSEQ® D2 rDNA Fungal Sequencing Kit. The prepared libraries were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, Applied BioSystems® 3500 Genetic Analyzer (ThermoFisher), and the sequencing peaks were analyzed using MicroSEQ® ID microbial identification v3.1 (ThermoFisher). For fungal identifications, the isolates were also confirmed morphologically and microscopically. Sanger sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840.2.4. Culture-independent, 16S rRNA nanopore sequencing and analysis To potentially identify non-culturable taxa from samples, established laboratory protocols for culture-independent, targeted nanopore sequencing were used [9]. Using a syringe, samples were passed through a 0.22 μm mixed cellulose esters (MCE) filter on a 13 mm filter holder (MilliporeSigma). The filter was then removed and placed into PCR tubes containing QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen Cooperation, Middleton, WI, USA) for DNA extraction. Following extraction within the miniPCR™ thermal cycler (miniPCR bio™, Cambridge, MA, USA), DNA purifications, quality assessments, and library preparation followed the established method described in Stahl-Rommel et al. 2021 [9]. The multiplexed libraries were loaded into the flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) version R9.4.1 and sequenced for 12 h using MinKNOW version 21.02.2 on MinION Mk1C (ONT). Data analysis was conducted as previously described [9]. Briefly, basecalling and demultiplexing was completed using GPU-enabled Guppy Basecalling Software 4.3.4 (ONT). Reads of 1350–1650 bp in length were selected using NanoFilt Version 2.6.0 [11] and mapped to the  Reference Sequence Database using Minimap2 version 2.24-r1122 (-ax map-ont) (Li 2018). SAMtools version 1.14, MAPping Quality (MAPQ) threshold of 1 [12] and MarginStats (marginStats.py 0.1) [13] were used for sequencing statistics. Data visualizations were created in R version 4.2.0 using the ggplot package and heatmap [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. Nanopore sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840.2.5. Genomic DNA extraction To acquire genomic DNA for hybrid full genome sequencing analysis, bacterial isolates were subcultured onto fresh R2A plates and incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 revolution per minute (rpm) for ∼17 h. To collect a cell pellet, inoculum of 1 mL was centrifuged at 16,000 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 2 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5810R, Enfield, CT, USA). The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was rinsed with PBS before resuspending with 40 μL of PBS by vortexing. DNA was extracted using the Circulomics Nanobind CBB Big DNA kit (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol optimized for high molecular weight DNA for Gram-negative bacteria. Extracted DNA was checked for quality and quantity using the QubitTM dsDNA BR assay kit with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher), NanodropTM (Nanodrop One, ThermoFisher), and TapeStation Genomic ScreenTape using 4200 TapeStation System reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).2.6. Illumina and nanopore genomic sequencing Short-read Illumina and long-read nanopore sequencing was performed to generate hybrid de-novo genomes. For Illumina sequencing, 100–500 ng of extracted genomic DNA was used for library preparation following the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation (24 samples) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and Nextera DNA CD 24 Indexes (Illumina) manufacturer’s protocol. Following library purification, the DNA was assessed for quality, quantity, and size (∼500–600 bp) using Qubit TM 1x dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher) and D1000 ScreenTape and reagents (Agilent). Samples were normalized to 4 nM, then pooled and diluted to a final concentration of 10 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). PhiX control V3 was prepared at 4 nM and diluted to 20 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). The 10 pM pooled library and 20 pM PhiX control v3 (Illumina) were denatured using fresh 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. The 1% PhiX control was added to the pooled DNA libraries. Pooled libraries were heated to 98 °C for 2 min for additional denaturation prior to loading into a MiSeq® Reagent v3 cartridge (600 cycles) (Illumina) and starting the run on the Illumina MiSeq. For nanopore sequencing, the genomic DNA was sequenced using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004, ONT) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, up to 12 genomic DNA samples at 400 – 1000 ng were fragmented, barcoded, and pooled before being purified using a 1:1 AMPure XP bead reaction (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The library was quantified using Qubit TM 1X HS Kit (ThermoFisher) then combined with 1 μl of RAP (ONT) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The pooled libraries were loaded into a R9.4.1 flow cell (ONT) within the MinION Mk1C running MinKNOW version 21.02.2 (ONT) and sequenced for 72 h.2.7. Hybrid genome assemblies, annotation, and analysis Illumina short reads were demultiplexed and fastq files generated using MiSeq Reporter Software version 2.6.2.3 (Illumina). Fastq files were filtered to remove sequencing adaptors, reads less than 50 bases in length, and the PhiX sequencing control using BBduk (BBTools version 38.54) [18]. BBduk also trimmed both ends of the fastq and selected reads with a quality score of 25 of higher. Nanopore long reads were basecalled and demultiplexed using the high accuracy configuration of Guppy (version 4.3.4) with a minimum quality score of 7 and minimum barcode score of 40. Sequencing adapters were removed from reads using Porechop version 0.2.4 [19] and the top 80% of reads were subsequently filtered for sequences >2000 bp with Filtlong version 0.2.0 [20]. Illumina and nanopore Hybrid de-novo genomes were assembled using Unicycler version 0.4.8 [21]. Genome assemblies were checked for quality and completeness using CheckM version 1.0.18 [22]. The identities of the assemblies were confirmed with average nucleotide identity (ANI) using fastANI version 1.3 against the  complete genome database [23]. Hybrid de-novo genomes were annotated for bacterial chromosomes and plasmids using the command line version of the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) version 6.0 [24]. PGAP was run using normal parameters with quality control analysis enabled. This version of PGAP included GeneMarkS-2 and GeneMark.hmm-2 for enhanced gene prediction using protein profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). AntiSMASH was used for recognition of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (GC) from the isolates [25]. A search for plasmids in the isolated genomes was conducted using the PlasmidFinder [26]. Figures and tables were constructed in R [14]. Graphs were rendered using the ggplot2 program and dependencies [16].2.8. Pangenome analysis In total, 86 B. contaminans and 10 P. fungorum genome assemblies were downloaded from the  RefSeq genome database as references [24,27]. Of the 86 B. contaminans RefSeq assemblies downloaded, six were duplicates and two lacked complete annotations, resulting in 78  references used this study. The five B. contaminans and two P. fungorum isolates identified in this study and annotated with PGAP were transformed into Anvio contig databases to be comparable with the downloaded  genomes during the anvi’o pangenome analysis [24]. Using anvi’o, (version 7.1) pangenome analysis was run to compare the single copy genes from our isolates to those in the  database using hidden Markov models (HMMs) [28]. Differences in gene number and gene clusters between the isolates and  genomes were observed. The anvi’o summary files were rendered and imported into R where the groups and bins were searched using dplyr (1.0.9) to filter rows based on presence and absence of matches.2.9. Environmental scanning electron microscope imaging Approximately 100 μL of fixed sample was loaded onto an Isopore membrane filter (0.8 μm pore size, 13 mm diameter, MilliporeSigma) and gravity filtered to reduce disturbance to any structure present in the sample. The samples were washed twice with 200 μL PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) then rinsed with 1000 μL of filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Sample dehydration was performed with serial rinses using freshly prepared ethanol (200 proof, Sigma-Aldrich) in filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Initial dehydration involved two sequential 30 min rinses with 500 μL of 25% ethanol then 500 μL of 50% ethanol. This process was continued by applying increasing concentrations of ethanol at 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% for 15 min each. Following dehydration, the filter was removed with the sample side up and flipped onto an aluminum mount flat pin with carbon conductive tab (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA). The samples were allowed to dry inside a biosafety cabinet and then placed into the ESEM chamber for additional drying under vacuum. Following drying, the samples were sputter coated with ∼2 nm iridium on a Cressington Sputter Coater 298 HR that uses a Cressington Thickness Controller MTM 20. Imaging was performed with a ThermoFisher Scientific FEI Quanta 250 using the ESEM mode. All images were acquired at 10 kV in back scatter electron mode at a pressure of ∼1.3 Torr.2.10. Biofilm assay Bacterial isolates were cultured on R2A media (Hardy Diagnostics) and incubated for at least 24 h at 35 °C or until visual colonies were observed. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of TSB (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for ∼17 h. The liquid culture was diluted 100X, and 200 μL was added to a well of a 96-well plate. Eight replicates of each isolate were prepared. The plates were then incubated at 35 °C without shaking. Beyond the isolates from the flex lines, positive and negative controls were prepared in the same manner with Burkholderia cepacia ATCC 25416 and TSB only, respectively. The plates were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. After each incubation period, washing, tapping, and dissociation of the biofilms was performed, and the biofilms were assessed as described previously [29]. A 200 μL of 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the washing was repeated after incubation time. The absorbance of the remaining crystal violet was evaluated at 540 nm using a SpectraMax® 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA, USA). Three set of plates were processed as described. The results are expressed as an average and standard deviation of four technical replicates and two biological replicates after background subtraction from the negative control. One-way ANOVA were performed using R v. 4.2.0.2.11. Bacterial-fungal interaction Aspergillus flavus, isolated from the ISS in samples returned on Soyuz 51, was used as a model to characterize the bacterial-fungal interactions of the flex line isolates. A. flavus, from a room temperature molecular water stock, was cultured on SABC for five days at 25 °C. To generate an experimental culture, a 1 μL loop was used to transfer spores to fresh SABC, which was then incubated for seven days at 25 °C. Synchronous bacterial isolates were cultured on R2A for 24–48 h at 35 °C. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of TSB (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for ∼17 h. Three different types of growth media were assessed by placing three 25 μL drops of the inoculum on R2A, potato dextrose (PDA) (Hardy Diagnostics) or SABC plates in a triangular pattern approximately 2 cm from the edge of the plate. After 24 h of incubation at 25 °C or 35 °C, a plug of 7-day-old A. flavus was introduced to the center of the three triangular bacterial drops. Fungal controls without bacteria were prepared in a similar manner. Two growth temperatures were investigated by placing the plates in either an incubator at 25 °C or 35 °C for five days. Following incubation, the growth diameter of the bacteria and the distance between the bacteria and fungi was measured. This was repeated using biological triplicates. The average and standard deviation of the measurements were calculated.2.12. Hemolysis activity Bacterial cultures of the flex line isolates were prepared as described above. Hemolysis activity was performed by placing three, 25 μL drops of liquid inoculum onto TSA containing 5% sheep’s blood (Hardy Diagnostics). The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 48 h and the zone of hemolysis was recorded.3. Results and discussions 3.1. Identification of microbial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines Three bacteria and one fungus were recovered from UPA95, while six bacteria and two fungi were recovered from UPA115, as detailed in Table 1. The three bacteria from UPA95 were all found to be Burkholderia species by Sanger sequencing but revealed distinct colony morphologies. Isolate 3.1 Burkholderia sp. colonies were milky white, isolate 3.2 Burkholderia sp. colonies were yellow, while isolate 3.3 B. fungorum colonies were smooth and white in appearance. The fungal isolate F3.1 was identified as a Fusarium sp. From UPA115, isolate 4.1 demonstrated rough, white colonies that were identified as B. fungorum. Additionally, three different Burkholderia morphologies were noted. Isolate 4.2 was white, whereas isolate 4.3 was yellow and isolate 4.5 was wet in appearance. The Burkholderia sp. 4.5 wet morphology was not noted from UPA95 and the two B. fungorum displayed different morphologies. Isolate 4.4 was a Gram-positive bacterium but could not be identified to the genus level. Isolate 5.2 was determined to be Leifsonia lichenia. The two fungal isolates from UPA115 were 4.1 Fusarium sp. and 4.2 Lecythophora mutabilis. Table 1. Culture-based identifications from UPA95 and UPA115 flex line hoses isolates via Sanger sequencing.

Leifsonia lichenia Open in a new tabIt is not unexpected that a higher diversity of organisms was recovered from UPA115 as compared to UPA95, as UPA95 experiences a higher concentration and prolonged exposure of the urine pre-treat solution during the recycling of the brine, as noted in Table 2. Bacterial isolate identification corresponds with historical data, as Burkholderia sp. is one of the most dominant bacterial genera recovered from the PWD and wastewater tank onboard the ISS [[30], [31], [32]]. The high prevalence of Burkholderia sp. is likely due to their resistance capabilities toward a broad range of metals [33,34] Historically, unidentified Gram-positive organisms and L. lichenia have been noted in samples returned from the ISS, but more common is the isolation of unidentified Gram-negative organisms. It is unclear if these bacteria survived the pre-treat solution or are part of the population downstream of the DA. While attempts are made to launch microbially-clean hardware for use onboard the ISS, hardware is not launched sterile. The recovered fungus, L. mutabilis, has been isolated by the JSC Microbiology Laboratory from returned wastewater (JSC archive, data not shown) and has also been noted from a filter within the WRS [30,31]. Fusarium sp. have been documented in the ISS environment, and it has associated with plant disease within the VEGGIE plant payload [35]. However, to the best of our knowledge, Fusarium sp. have not previously been isolated from any returned PWD or wastewater samples from the ISS. Table 2.

Culture-independent, 16S nanopore-generated microbial profiles A culture-independent method that is currently being used onboard the ISS for bacterial surface monitoring [9] was applied to the remaining volume of flush water not consumed by other evaluations. Greater diversity was noted using this method compared to the culture-based data (Fig. 2). Paralleling the culture-based data, Burkholderia and Leifsonia were present, and UPA115 demonstrated overall greater diversity as compared to UPA95 (Fig. 2). Fig. 2.

Alignments were generated with minimap2 (-ax map-ont).3.3. Full genome analysis of bacterial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 To construct their genomes, short read (Illumina) and long read (nanopore) sequencing was conducted for the nine bacterial isolates recovered from the two flex lines. Genome summary metrics are listed in Table 2. Hybrid genome assemblies range from 3.8 to 9.7 million base pairs with 3–20 contigs (Table 3). The total genome size, percent GC content, and total gene clusters were comparable to  references (Table 3). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the nine isolates ranged from 80.1 to 99.9 similarity to other genomes within . Based on these data, isolate identifications have been further defined beyond the Sanger 16S rRNA data. Isolates 3.1, 4.2, and 3.2, 4.3, and 4.5 were identified to B. contaminans, with an ANI 95.6 and 99.9 respectively [23] (Table 3). Isolates 3.3 and 4.1 were identified as Paraburkholderia fungorum, based on updated nomenclature [36]. Isolates 4.4 and 5.2 did not change and will be described as a Gram-positive bacterium, and Leifsonia lichenia, respectively, due to low ANI percentages likely resulting from low representation of these organisms’ genomes.

PS1209 81.0 Open in a new tabComplete plasmids were not observed in any of nine isolates; however, multiple gene clusters associated with plasmids were noted. This corresponds to previous research detailing the loss of plasmids as a result of co-location and evolution among species in the Burkholderia cepacia complex [37]. Additionally, this parallels preceding reports assessing other B. contaminans isolates from the ISS potable water system [38]. Plasmid loss could potentially be a response of these organisms to the environment within the ISS water system where the associated genes do not lend a competitive advantage. Expanded evaluation of the bacterial isolates that could be identified was conducted through pangenomic analysis using the genomes of P. fungorum and B. contaminans. The B. contaminans pangenome analysis resulted in 13,598 unique gene clusters across the 78  reference genomes and the 5 isolates: 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 (Fig. 3). Of the unique gene clusters, 3,720 did not have a known function from the  PGAP annotations. There was a high average geometric homogeneity index (GHI) and a functional homogeneity index (FHI) of 0.97. The high GHI of the analysis indicates that the patterns of residues within gene clusters are mostly uniform, and the high FHI in this study indicates that any differences are minimal and likely will not impact the protein products between genomes sharing unique clusters. Chromate and biofilm-related gene functions were searched for across pangenome annotations and marked in orange and yellow, respectively (Fig. 3). Biofilm gene clusters and quorum system sensor gene clusters were observed in all 83 genomes. Multiple chromate resistance and transporter protein gene clusters stood out as features that set the five isolates from this study apart from the  assemblies and from the other previously reported ISS isolates (Fig. 3, Table S1). The presence of these resistance gene clusters is not surprising and provides insight to the organism’s ability to survive the pretreatment solution within the UPA. Fig. 3.

Orange text represents gene clusters associated with chromate resistance according to function. The light blue text represents gene clusters associated with biofilm formation. The details of all the B. contaminans functional genes and gene clusters can be found in Table S1. B) Pangenomic analysis of the two P. fungorium isolates 3.3 and 4.1 sequenced in this study, which are noted in teal, with 10 available assemblies from , noted in black. Here, as well as A, the orange text represents gene clusters associated with chromate resistance according to function. The details of the P. fungorium functional genes and gene clusters can be found in Table S2. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)The B. contaminans isolates from this study clustered together into two distinct groups based on amino acid similarity. The isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 (shown in pink, Fig. 3) are grouped together while other isolates 3.1 and 4.2 (shown in purple, Fig. 3) are grouped. These isolates from this investigation grouped separately from the previous ISS potable water B. contaminans assemblies (shown in red, Fig. 3) [38]. The five B. contaminans isolates from this investigation did not share any unique gene clusters that were not observed in the reference genomes. However, isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 had 42 unique gene clusters with 23 of those having identified functions. Isolates 3.1 and 4.2 had 417 unique gene clusters, with 145 of those having identified functions that were not found in the other isolate groups or genome references. Isolates 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5 had several unique gene clusters of interest related to cadmium, toxin-antitoxin, flavodoxin and hemolysin proteins (Table S1). These gene clusters could potentially be associated to the enhancement of virulence, a broad range of metal resistance, active metabolism, and high hemolytic activity [[39], [40], [41], [42]]. Moreover, the toxin-antitoxin gene clusters have been previously connected to dormancy scenarios and a persister phenotype [43,44]. For isolates 3.1 and 4.2, some unique gene clusters of interest are associated with pilin, porin, copper-binding protein, zincin, arsenate and arsenic transporter, type II and IV secretion, and type II toxin-antitoxin. These gene clusters could correspond to cell adhesion ability, molecule transport, heavy metal resistance, and toxin-antitoxin ability [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. While further evaluation into the expression and protein function is required, the differences in these gene clusters within the genome may provide insight into the morphological differences among the B. contaminans isolates. The P. fungorum pangenome analysis had 9,804 unique gene clusters across the 10  reference genomes and the two isolates: 3.3 and 4.1 (Fig. 3). Of these unique gene clusters, 2,314 did not have a known function from the PGAP annotations. The FHI was 0.97 and the GHI was 0.98. These values indicate that the gene cluster residues are uniform with a low chance of protein functional change inside unique gene clusters. Gene clusters directly associated with biofilms were not observed across these 12 genomes. However, one unique quorum sensing gene cluster and 10 unique chromate-associated gene clusters were observed across all 12 genomes. There were 371 unique gene clusters shared between the 3.3 and 4.1 isolates that were not present in the 10  references. Notably, a unique gene cluster associated with the chromate resistance protein (ChrB) was observed in both 3.3 and 4.1 but absent from the  references. It is important to note that the significant difference in the number of unique gene clusters could be due to the lower number of available references from the current database for P. fungorum. Beyond chromate, resistance associated gene clusters were also noted for copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc (Table S2). Again, while expression and protein products require further investigation, based on the genomic analysis, these organisms are likely to have tailored their genomes to support persistence within the flex line hoses.3.4. Environmental scanning electron microscopy of UPA95 and UPA115 samples While the microbial population within the two flex lines had not previously been investigated or understood, previous biofilm-related issues within the ISS WPA resulted in questions of potential biofilms within other parts of the system. As such, samples of stagnant water within the flex lines were fixed immediately upon opening UPA95 and UPA115. Fungal biofilm networks were distinctly apparent in the samples from both flex lines (Fig. 4A, B, G, and H). However, fungal biofilm growth was more pronounced in UPA115 (Fig. 4G and H), as opposed to UPA95 (Fig. 4A and B). This observation parallels the higher microbial concentration noted from UPA115 as compared to UPA95, which is most likely due to the elevated levels of pre-treat solution in UPA95 preventing some microbial outgrowth (Table 2). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Environmental scanning electron microscopy images of water from the UPA flex lines. A – F) Samples resulting from flex line UPA95, in which high concentrations of the urine pretreatment solution are encountered. G – L) Samples resulting from flex line UPA115, in which the urine pretreatment solution is diluted as water vapor is carried to the distillation assembly. Red arrows denote potential biofilm biproducts such as EPS, yellow arrows denote bacterial cells, and blue arrows denote fungal hyphae. The increased abundance of the microbial growth displayed from the UPA115 flex lines (A and B low magnification) as compared to that noted from the UPA95 flex lines (G and H low magnification), demonstrates the more favorable and growth promoting conditions and clear fungal-bacterial biofilm formation (as also noted in higher magnification J – L) within the UPA115 flex line. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Upon magnification, present fungal hyphae were noted in various morphologies with smooth, twisted, straight, and rough surfaces revealed. Additionally, presence of bacteria on the fungal hyphae was noted at higher magnification (Fig. 4I). Bacteria and fungi interactively growing in the same environment has been investigated intensively and it is established that bacteria can grow both on and within the fungal hyphae [50]. This, along with other variables such as the presence of chemicals and/or bioproducts such as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) could explain alterations in the hyphae surface [[51], [52], [53]]. While it is unknown which organisms produced it, EPS was noted in among the images (Fig. 4C, F, 4K, 4L). Taken together, this is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS.3.5. Biofilm potential of bacterial UPA95 and UPA115 isolates To empirically evaluate biofilm potential of the flex line bacterial isolates, a traditional crystal violet assay was performed following 24, 48, and 72 h of growth. At the earliest 24-h timepoint, significantly enhanced biofilm formation was noted for B. contaminans 3.1, 3.2, and 4.2, as compared to the reference control (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this was not seen at 48 h, which could be attributed to weak cell to cell adhesion or cell communication and a longer required time for quorum sensing to regulate EPS production and stabilize biofilm structure [54]. As expected, at 72 h, more mature biofilms were present for all the isolates including the reference control. However, B. contaminans 3.1 and 4.2 displayed significantly higher biofilm production as compared to the reference (Fig. 5). While it was not surprising to see biofilm formation from Burkholderia [55,56], the production by some of the UPA isolates was notable and depicts the biofilm potential of these organisms. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of bacterial isolates from the UPA flex lines. Crystal violet intensity was evaluated at 540 nm. Isolates 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3 demonstrated pronounced biofilm formation as compared to the control at 24 h. Isolates 3.1 and 4.2 also demonstrated pronounced biofilm formation as compared to the controls at 72 h (*, P < 0.05). Statistical data can be found in Table S3. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Probing the genomes for secondary metabolites revealed gene clusters associated with pyoverdin in B. contaminans 3.1 and 4.2, but not other isolates (Fig. 6). Pyoverdin production directly correlates with biofilm formation, as has been documented regarding the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [57,58]. With regard to Burkholderia, pyoverdine production has been associated with biofilm formation and pathogenicity in B. thailandensis [59]. However, the association of pyoverdin is unknown in the majority of this genera. Furthermore, the genomic data also reveal gene clusters associated with secondary metabolites involved in quorum sensing activity for all the B. contaminans and P. fungorum isolates, but not for the L. lichenia or unidentified Gram-positive bacterium (Fig. 6). The iron-binding or antifungal functional group such as occidiofungin, pyrrolnitrin, pyochelin and ornibactin are regulated by quorum sensing activity [60,61], which is major regulator of biofilm formation. Also, iron-signaling mechanisms contribute to biofilm development, which have been previously investigated with P. aeruginosa biofilms [62]. The crystal violet assay demonstrates the biofilm potential of these isolates, which corresponds with the presence of secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with biofilm production. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Gene clusters associated with known secondary metabolites from genomes from the UPA flex lines isolates identified using antiSMASH. The secondary metabolites of interest pyoverdine, occidiofungin, pyrrolnitrin, pyochelin, and ornibactin are associated with biofilm production, quorum sensing, antifungal properties, and hemolytic activity. The intensity of the color represents the completeness of the gene cluster compared to  reference. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)3.6. Characterization of bacterial-fungal interactions and hemolytic activity Assessing phenotypic traits from monocultures benefits microbial characterization. However, the importance of investigating interactions between organisms can provide greater insight toward community dynamics and is essential to our understanding of an environment’s microbiome. Bacterial-fungal interactions can result in molecular alterations that have the potential to influence pathogenicity, biofilm formation, or morphology of the microorganisms [63]. Likely as a result of predation within their environment, B. contaminans generates protective antifungal compounds that were noted within the genomes [61,64]. Of interest were biosynthetic gene clusters associated with the secondary metabolites occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin, which were observed in B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3 genomes. Organisms within the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) synthesize the antifungal occidiofungin through a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase mechanism [65,66]. Pyrrolnitrin, also an antifungal, is a product of quorum sensing [60]. Occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin have shown antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus [67,68]. Additionally, both antifungal compounds have also been tightly associated to hemolytic activity [38,61]. Therefore, the impact of potential secondary metabolite production from all the UPA isolates on A. flavus was evaluated using three types of media under two temperatures. Hemolytic potential was also assessed. At 25 °C incubation, B. contaminans isolates 3.2, 4.3, 4.5 from both UPA flex lines generated the highest zone of inhibition on A. flavus as compared to the other isolates, including the reference control B. cepacia (Fig. 7A). Other B. contaminans 3.1, and 4.2, P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1, and B. cepacia did express the capability of inhibiting the growth of A. flavus but at a much lower intensity (Fig. 7A). This was enhanced by culture on PDA (Fig. 7A and 7B). Not unexpectedly, the growth media impacted the antagonistic effect on A. flavus, as was observed for R2A, while B. contaminans 3.1, and 4.2 and P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 did not strongly inhibit A. flavus growth (Fig. 7A). Regarding SABC, a zone of inhibition was not noted for any of the isolates, likely resulting from the interfering chloramphenicol. However, P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 showed very weak antagonistic effect, as fungal growth was observed. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab A) Bacterial-fungal interaction between UPA flex line bacterial isolates and A. flavus at two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) and three growth media (R2A, PDA and SABC). Bar plot denotes the fungal diameter while the dot plot in red displays distance. B) The interaction of A. flavus with UPA flex line bacterial isolates on PDA at 25 °C. All measurements were in triplicate for each isolate. The distance for antagonistic activity was measured between the fungal growth and bacterial deposit (red arrow). The fungal growth diameter was measured triplicate. For irregularly shaped fungal growth, the measurement was taken from three different growth directions, assuming it was a diameter (blue arrow). See Table S3 for statistical data. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)A more optimal growth temperature for bacteria, 35 °C incubation was also investigated. Generally, there was no difference in the trend of antagonistic growth toward A. flavus as compared to 25 °C incubation. The growth diameter of A. falvus did not change between the temperatures for R2A and PDA media, but more growth was noted on SABC at 35 °C (Fig. 7A.). B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3 expressed the highest antifungal capability at both temperatures and on all media assessed. The antagonistic distance was reduced at 35 °C on PDA media for B. contaminans 3.2, 4.3 and 4.5., which indicated the reduction of antifungal activity. Although there was no change in fungal growth, B. contaminans 4.5 showed much lower antagonistic distance on R2A at 35 °C. The unidentified Gram-positive 4.4 and L. lichenia 5.2. did not express observable antifungal activity toward A. flavus on any of the tested media at either temperature (Fig. 7A). The association of L. lichenia with fungi is not well established. L. xyli has exhibited plant growth promoting and low level antifungal properties against certain plant pathogens [69]. In this investigation antifungal behavior was not noted with L. lichenia, nor were known gene clusters associated with fungal inhibition present. Pyochelin biosynthesis cluster was observed in the B. contaminans 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 genomes and ornibactin gene cluster found in B. contaminans 3.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 and P. fungorum 3.3 and 4.1 (Fig. 6). These secondary metabolites are siderophores [70]. Although pyochelin and ornibactin are not well-known as antifungal agents secreted by Paraburkholderia and Burkholderia, they have shown their antifungal and antimicrobial activity under iron deficiency [[71], [72], [73]]. Hemolytic activity was noted for B. contaminans 4.5, which demonstrated α-hemolysis activity, while B. contaminans 3.2 and 4.3. expressed strong β-hemolysis (Table S4 and Fig. S2). All other isolates displayed γ-hemolysis (no hemolytic activity) following 48 h of incubation (Table S4 and Fig. S2).4. Conclusions The WRS has been providing potable water to astronauts onboard the ISS since 2009. However, our current understanding of the microbial community within the system is limited to the WPA wastewater tank and point-of-use PWD samples. This work represents the first investigation into the unique community that inhabits the UPA. From the UPA115 flex line, a purge line carrying water vapor to the DA, three differing morphologies of B. contaminans, as well as P. fungorum, L. lichenia, and an unidentified Gram-positive bacterium, were isolated; additionally, the fungi Fusarium sp. and L. mutabilis were isolated. Less diversity was noted from samples recovered from the UPA95 flex line, where concentrated levels of chromium are encountered, from which two different morphologies of B. contaminans, P. fungorum, and Fusarium sp. were isolated. For the five B. contaminans isolates, multiple chromate-resistance and transporter protein gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the PWD. Moreover, the UPA P. fungorum isolates contained a gene cluster associated with chromate resistance that was absent in the current  references. The acquisition of these resistance gene clusters by these organisms, as compared to both those from the WPA and terrestrial environments, distinguishes these flex lines as a unique ecological niche. Furthermore, this highlights that the flex lines, as well as other areas within the UPA, are ideal candidate areas to investigate horizontal gene transfer. As a dormant water system is a likely option for future spacecraft, e.g. the Lunar Gateway, where biofouling is a significant concern, biofilm analysis and imaging was performed. ESEM imaging of the water from the flex lines and biofilm potential of the recovered isolates demonstrated that these hoses are novel areas for fungal-bacterial biofilm growth. While NASA has a strong biofilm control campaign, the organisms used in these studies have been limited to those isolated from the WPA. Further analysis of isolates from the UPA, displaying a greater range of genetic and phenotypic properties, as well as the fungal-bacterial interactions at play within these biofilms, should be a high priority to aid in the design of engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in next generation water systems.Funding This work was supported by NASA Exploration Capabilities and the Johnson Space Center’s Office of the Chief Technologist.CRediT authorship contribution statement Hang Ngoc Nguyen: General, Methodology, Sequencing, Phenotypic Evaluation, Bioinformatics, Data, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, preparation, All authors agreed to the published version of this manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM®Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction 1.1. Microbial Communities in Space Microbial communities are an integral part of space exploration: they accompany human crew in habitats such as the International Space Station [1] and they will ultimately be used for bioregenerative life support [2], food and pharmaceuticals production [3], and in situ resource utilization [4]. Like all organisms, microbes experience stress in the space environment: studies have documented changes in virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and population diversity [5,6]. However, the mechanisms by which spaceflight induces these responses remain poorly understood. Many of the processes documented for multicellular organisms, such as mitochondrial dysregulation and mechanical unloading [7], do not apply to single-celled organisms; moreover, microorganisms almost invariably live in communities, but few studies of any organisms at any scale have investigated the effects of space conditions on interspecies interactions. Understanding the microbial space response requires an approach that considers the interactions between microbial cells and their environments at relevant spatial scales. 1.2. Validating Clinostats for Accurate Artificial Microgravity Conditions Of the stressors present in the spaceflight environment, altered gravity is the feature most likely to affect microorganisms in habitable environments, such as a spacecraft. It is also the feature most difficult to replicate in ground studies. Since spaceflight experiments are costly, logistically difficult, and inaccessible to many researchers, artificial microgravity devices, such as clinostats and rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, are commonly used to replicate microgravity conditions. An RWV is a type of clinostat that is used for cell culture: they are cylindrical culture vessels filled with liquid culture medium that constantly rotate the fluid environment, keeping cells in suspension by continuously changing the orientation of the gravity vector [8,9]. However, there is a fundamental difference between microbial cells and larger organisms in the way that rotation is used to simulate microgravity. For plants grown in clinostats, the constant rotation of the gravity vector results in an average gravity vector of zero over time. For microbial cells, which are believed to be unable to sense gravity directly, it is the ability of the RWV to mimic the unique fluid environment of microgravity that is likely its most important feature [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Understanding the fluid dynamics of the RWV is therefore critical for conducting rigorous research into the effects of spaceflight on microorganisms. 1.3. The Microgravity Fluid Environment The loss of natural convection in microgravity causes the fluid environment to be quiescent. Likewise, the idealized RWV fluid environment is under solid-body rotation, with minimal fluid shear and turbulence [8]. However, a disparity is observed in the cellular response when comparing RWV and microgravity conditions, which may be caused by a complex set of factors, including hardware effects, mechanotransduction, and nutrient stress [16,17]. RWVs also exhibit centrifugal sedimentation of cell aggregates, resulting in localization that is different from that found in true microgravity [8]. There are very few commercially available bioreactors; therefore, they are often custom-designed by researchers and unique to each researcher’s experiment. A general lack of knowledge about accurate RWV conditions is a problem that may be one of the sources of contradictory conclusions about the effect of microgravity among cell biological circles, assuming there even is a unified microgravity response on bacterial cells at all [18,19]. 1.4. The Effect of Microgravity on Microbial Ecology The interaction between the phases—that is, how microbial cells alter their fluid environment and vice versa—is especially important for understanding the behavior of multispecies microbial communities in space. No microbial species lives in isolation. Microorganisms form communities in which different species interact in numerous ways, and one of the interactions most commonly documented is the exchange of metabolites used for growth, often called cross-feeding [6,20]. In a quiescent microgravity fluid environment, reduced mixing could lead to a reduced exchange of metabolites, which, in turn, would shift community dynamics. Although a few microbial community experiments have been done in artificial microgravity [21], there are no previous studies that attempt to validate computational models for a quantitative understanding of microbial community dynamics in these devices. Numerous computational fluid dynamics studies on the macro-scale have been done to validate the ability of clinostats and RWV’s to produce the desired quiescent fluidic environment, but the scope of these studies often includes the fluid phase only, or solid parcel fractions, without metabolite scalar transport [22,23,24,25,26,27]. We sought to fill this gap by building a computational model that integrates both fluid and particle dynamics with biological metabolism and growth to generate predictions of microbial community dynamics in 1 g, microgravity, and RWV conditions. As an initial demonstration, we modeled a community composed of two obligately cross-feeding bacterial species that were previously studied and modeled extensively [20,28,29,30]. 1.5. Agent-Based Models for Microbial Communities Agent-based models, also known as individual-based models, operate at the resolution of the individual cell. Each agent, i.e., bacterial cell, is given certain rules to follow, placed in an environment, and expected to interact with that environment as well as with other agents. Complex interactions between agents, distributions, and patterns arise from these models, and they are essential for the modeling of microbial communities. Computational agent-based models in the microbial ecology field are actively being developed; one of the latest scientific agent-based simulations is NUFEB [31], which features biological growth kinetics and coupled fluid–solid interaction, but not solute scalar transport. To apply the principles of agent-based modeling to spaceflight and artificial microgravity, we present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), which is an additional package for established, non-biological CFD-DEM software. It is based on the open-source software CFDEM®Coupling [32] and LIGGGHTS® [33], and it brings CFD-DEM modeling capability to RWVs. CAMDLES features include a rotating reference frame simulation environment, the buoyant Boussinesq approximation for natural convective flows, and Monod kinetic metabolic models for calculation of biological growth rates. CAMDLES is also the first agent-based model that directly couples metabolism to mass transfer.",

An Engineered Cross-Feeding Microbial Community We simulated a previously described (Figure 2) engineered model microbial community involving two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli K12 ΔmetB and Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, that were extensively studied in 1 g but not in space conditions [20,28,29,30,40,41,42,43]. The E. coli strain is auxotrophic for the amino acid methionine and secretes acetate as a secondary metabolic product. The S. enterica depends on the secreted acetate for growth, and the strain was experimentally evolved to secrete methionine to support the E. coli. The coculture is therefore dependent upon cross-feeding when grown in a minimal medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source for growth. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Model microbial community simulated in this study. Adapted with permission from [28]; published by Cell Reports, 2014. When grown in minimal media with lactose, Escherichia coli K12 with a metB gene knockout (E. coli ΔmetB) provides acetate as the carbon growth substrate necessary for a methionine-secreting mutant of Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium (S. enterica) to grow. In exchange, the S. enterica provides the methionine necessary for the E. coli to grow.Because of the organisms’ dependence on the flux of exchanged metabolites, the population dynamics of this model microbial community were found to depend on the spatial structure of the community [20]. For instance, colonies growing on agar medium achieve smaller sizes when located further away from each other, and a third colony blocking the exchange of metabolites between an E. coli colony and an S. enterica colony can cause a complex “metabolic eclipse” effect [28]. We hypothesized that in cross-feeding cocultures, reduced mixing in a quiescent microgravity fluid environment will enable high growth rates when the two species are colocalized in cooperative colonies, but only low growth rates when the species are located distantly from one another. We further hypothesized that in an RWV that simulates microgravity imperfectly, a variety of mechanical and fluid interactions will reduce the impact of colony localization on the growth rate. 2.3. Simulation Domain In our simulations, we designed cooperative colonies with varying degrees of population density and localization. Limits in computing power necessarily made simulation timespans much shorter than the generation time of the species; we, therefore, considered the growth rate in terms of the cell mass increase rather than replication, in addition to metabolite production and consumption rates, to assess whether relative growth rates and mass transfer rates were sustainable in our prescribed cocultures. Additionally, CAMDLES does not support changes in diffusion based on solutes or solids, such as an extracellular matrix (ECM); therefore, to simulate the effect of such features, we were constrained to choosing a constant diffusion rate for each solute. We compared three diffusion rates: low diffusion seen in solid biofilms/ECM, intermediate diffusion, and high diffusion seen in liquid media (Table S1). When the distinction is not stated, we set all solute diffusivities to an intermediate 5 × 10−6 cm2/s. We chose our computational domain to be a box that was 300 μm × 100 μm × 300 μm in size, which is the smallest box that can host two cells at an inoculation cell density of 105 cells/mL per species. A fluid parcel was 5 μm × 20 μm × 5 μm with a volume equal to that of ~430 bacterial cells when randomly packed. For some case studies, we varied the cell densities between 105 and 108 cells/mL, exploring a range of microbial population densities commonly achieved with this system in laboratory culture. During simulation initialization, cells were placed in colony-like formations: either a dense spherical mass of cells, or a mass with Gaussian random distributions around a sphere. We also tested random cell placements distributed throughout the computational domain, as well as a cylindrical colony formation as an approximation of a biofilm shape in the case of 1 g gravity. Periodic boundary conditions were set for the non-radial boundaries. In the radial direction, the outer wall was set as an inlet with zero velocity, and the inner wall was a freestream outlet. Cell metabolism was kickstarted by giving each species cell equivalents of product for the other species, i.e., E. coli was given acetate, and S. enterica was given methionine. This is similar to previous studies with this system using modeling with ordinary differential equations and is necessary to enable growth at initial timepoints [29]. In simulations with higher initial cell populations, we gave less starting product, ranging from 10−2 cell equivalents during inoculation, to 10−8 at maximum population. After initialization, each case study ran for two to five minutes, assuming cell growth to be exponential during this time. 2.4. Mechanical Models We assumed the volume and density of a bacterial cell to be the same for both species, namely, E. coli and S. enterica. The volume was calculated as if the cell was a spherocylinder, but was converted to an equivalent Stokes radius (1) and approximated as a sphere in silico. r=3Vcell4π13 (1) The Stokes drag for a very low Reynolds number was applied to each bacterial cell (2). vs⇀ and uf⇀ are the solid and fluid velocities, respectively. In this study, uf in (2) was assumed to be negligible. Because of the low inertia, the solid–fluid momentum coupling caused by the Stokes drag was also assumed to be negligible. Fviscous=6πrμvs−uf (2) In the case of artificial microgravity, the simulation box was placed in a rotating reference frame that matched the rotation rate of the RWV (see Figure 3). Solid-body fluid rotation was enforced at the beginning of the artificial microgravity simulation. The net body frame acceleration a⇀B was derived (3) using centrifugal, Coriolis, gravity, and drag accelerations for the cells in the rotating frame. Archimedean buoyancy was also accounted for in the centrifugal and gravity terms by use of specific gravity. The last term is the viscous drag, with ρfρs being the fluid–solid density ratio and ν being the kinematic liquid viscosity. a⇀B=−ω⇀×ω⇀×rB⇀ 1−ρfρs−2ω⇀×vB⇀+g⇀1−ρfρs−92ρfρsνvs⇀−uf⇀1r2 (3) Figure 3. Open in a new tab Free body diagram of a particle immersed in an RWV. Acceleration terms are described in Equation (3). The simulation domain is a rectangular box in a rotating reference frame.Because rB⇀ spans the range of only ±1.5%, rB⇀ was set to a constant extending to the center of the simulation box. The centrifugal acceleration term was approximated as a uniform body force ac⇀. In this study, we set the radius of rotation to be 1 cm, positioning the computational domain within an imagined culture vessel with a rotation rate of 10 R.P.M. (common for bacteria in artificial microgravity experiments). The rotating reference frame acceleration was also applied to the fluid as a modification of the left-hand side of the incompressible Navier–Stokes Equation (4). The Boussinesq approximation for natural, solutal, and convective flows was applied to the right-hand side of the equation; this assumed that solutal changes in fluid density were small enough to affect buoyancy force only and neither the inertia nor viscosity [40]. For this study, this approximation was included three times, once for each metabolite in the media: acetate, methionine, and lactose. ε is the local fluid volume fraction. ∂εuf⇀∂t+εuf⇀· ∇uf⇀+ εω⇀×ω⇀×rB⇀ +2ω⇀×vB⇀=−ε∇prghρ+ν∇·∇ε uf⇀+εg⇀+ac⇀βSiSi−SiR+… (4) Here, prgh is the modified pressure prgh=p−ρfg ⇀·h ⇀, with h ⇀ as the height of the fluid. The scalar βSi linearly interpolates the difference in the ith solute concentration—compared to a reference concentration SiR—to a difference in fluid density. The cells were assumed to be non-motile strains for simplicity. Non-motile strains show an increased response to microgravity effects compared to motile strains, which may be due to their inability to migrate in their fluid environment [17,19,44]. Moreover, for simplicity, Brownian motion was not incorporated because the phenomenon is independent of the microgravity environment and can be approximated as negligible in solid biofilms and adherent cultures [45]; however, Brownian motion can be incorporated in future implementations of the model since it is a built-in LAMMPS feature. Brownian motion-based diffusion is about one thousand times smaller than solute diffusion [46] and was accounted for long-term in the creation of initial cell Gaussian distributions at the start of the simulations. 2.5. Chemical Models We assumed the chemical concentrations within the cell to be uniform at the chemical timestep, making the following Equation (6) suitable for mass transport into the cell. The rate of substrate intake is dependent on the cell surface area AC, the mass transfer coefficient hS, and the substrate concentration difference from the fluid parcel outside of the cell to the inside of the cell. dSCdt=AChS S−SC (5) The mass transfer coefficient hS is related to the local fluid parcel Sherwood number (6). A Sherwood number correlation for CFD-DEM flows that were empirically determined was provided by Deen et al. [47]. hSDM/2r=Sh=7−10ε+5ε21+0.17ReP15 Sc13+1.33−2.31ε+1.16ε2ReP710 Sc13 ; 0 ≤ReP ≤100 (6) ε is the fluid parcel volume fraction, Sc is the Schmidt number, and the particle Reynolds number ReP is between 0 and 100. We assumed that the growth was directly dependent on one substrate only. For E. coli, the rate-limiting substrate was methionine, and for S. enterica, acetate. Because we assumed their growth was rate-limited as a phenomenon of mass transfer, and not of internal cell metabolism, we assumed zero-order kinetics for each cell to convert the substrate into a product once the substrate was transported into the cell [48]. Using biomass yield ratios (Table S1), quantities of substrate were scaled to cell biomass equivalents and then nondimensionalized using the standard cell mass. For S. enterica: 1 cell equivalent Acetate→yields(YMA cell equivalents) Methionine k=μmax,S. enterica (7) compared to E. coli: 1 cell equivalent Methionine+1 cell equivalent Lactose→yields(YAM cell equivalents) Acetate k=μmax,E. (8) 2.6. Biological Models We set up all simulations to occur during the exponential growth phase, and thus all cells were actively growing during the simulation. The Monod kinetic model for single-cell growth, where S is the media bulk substrate concentration, is commonly used in agent-based and metabolic cell models [49]. μ=μmax SKS+S (9) CAMDLES uses an altered Monod kinetic model that directly ties Monod kinetics to rate-limiting mass transfer [48]. Here (10), Sf and SC are the concentrations of the local fluid parcel surrounding the cell and within the cell, respectively. Thus, KS differs from that seen in (9) and those seen in empirical growth data. μ=μmax Sf−SCKS+Sf−SC (10) In Equation (11), the Monod half-velocity constant KS is related to the heat transfer coefficient, the biomass density, the diameter of a spherical cell, the maximal growth rate, the biomass–substrate yield ratio, and the mass transfer coefficient. KS=1hS ρcdcμmax 6YXS (11) At the simulation timescale of a few minutes only, we expected no cell division to occur. Thus, we refer to the growth rate as the individual cell increase in mass. Because we focused on relative growth rates in comparing RWV and microgravity environments, we assumed the metabolism to cause anabolic growth only, with no maintenance or decay terms like those found in NUFEB. This assumption is valid for the mass transfer-based Monod kinetic model (10) [50].",

Results Experiment inputs for all simulations described in this manuscript are given in Supplementary Table S2 and input files are available at the Zenodo data repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6369617). In all simulations, we found that E. coli and S. enterica growth were directly coupled. As one grew, so did the other at a rate based on the ratio of their cell yield ratios: YAMYMA. To simplify the presentation, we depict only one species or metabolite at a time in figures, choosing to represent the species with more growth. Mean growth rates across a species are presented only when the simulation ran to steady-state growth. We report relative growth rates as a percentage of the maximum growth rate: μmax = 1.82 × 10−5 s−1 for E. coli and μmax = 9.09 × 10−6 s−1 for S. enterica. 3.1. Microgravity For the first set of CAMDLES simulations, we tested the hypothesis that co-localization is necessary to enable high growth rates in the simplest environment: no gravity force. We sought to characterize how, in this condition, the spatial arrangement of the microbial community members influenced their ability to exchange metabolites and grow. 3.1.1. Colocalization or Starting Metabolites Could Initiate Growth after Inoculation Laboratory experiments are often initiated with a low population density. We tested an inoculation cell count of one cell per species in the simulation (equivalent to ~105 cells/mL in a larger volume) and assessed the dependence of growth on spatial organization. In a typical experiment inoculated at low density, we can expect some E. coli and S. enterica cells to colocalize via random chance. We compared three levels of spatial organization with the placement of two cells ranging from as close as possible (1 μm) to as far away as possible (218 μm). We observed that at this cell count, the steady-state growth rate depended on the spatial organization under normal conditions (μ = 1.2 × 10−6 s−1, 4.9% of maximum growth rate when close together, compared to 0.8% when far apart). However, we also tested the effect of starting cells with high intracellular levels of the opposite species’ metabolite (0.01 cell equivalents of acetate or methionine, as compared to a nominal 0.00001 cell equivalents), and found that in this situation, the dependence of growth on spatial organization was mostly lost; cells grew at μ = 2.9 × 10−6 s−1 when closest together and at μ = 2.7 × 10−6 s−1 when farthest apart.3.1.2. Early-Phase Growth Rates Increased with Time and Population Density In the early, low-density growth phase (100–283 cells in the simulation, ~106 cells/mL), we assumed that cells randomly divide and distribute throughout liquid media. Thus, we set diffusion rates in the early growth phase to be that of the liquid culture. We tested a counterexample with both 100-cell and 283-cell spherical-Gaussian-packed colonies and found their steady growth rate to be hindered by ~10% compared to a randomly distributed simulation placement (Table S2), likely due to spatial interference for diffusion or Monod competition for metabolites. In contrast, at higher population counts (2000 cells in the simulation, ~108 cells/mL), the exchange of metabolites was most rapid in a compact clump of cells (Figure 4). Overall, we found that for the configuration with random spatial distributions, larger populations reached higher growth rates but with diminishing returns as populations approach densities on the order of ~107 cells/mL, and never reached the growth rates achieved by densely packed cells (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Average E. coli Fold Change in Mass vs. Colony Population in Microgravity. Solid lines represent statistical means, while transparent wedges represent inner quartiles. Either densely packed spherical or randomly distributed colonies were generated at various sizes. Only one colony was generated per simulation. Note: as the population density increased, the standard deviation of growth rates increased, which was likely caused by local spatial heterogeneity within the simulation domain, increasing the likelihood of resource competition.At low cell counts, growth did not reach a steady-state rate, and it may likely never be reached within simulation timescales. Thus, we interpreted non-steady growth as a marker for a growth regime: the only way for average culture growth rates to increase in the early phase is for cells to divide and spread out.3.1.3. Growth Rate Was Limited by Diffusion Rate with Increasing Colony Size In a cross-feeding community, the growth rate is non-linearly dependent on the total number and density of cells: as described above, there are some regimes in which more cells lead to faster growth, but in colonies of many densely packed cells, the biomass and extracellular matrix (ECM) may limit the diffusion rate of metabolites. In an experiment, colonies may densely or loosely pack depending on the gravity platform: microgravity alone may result in the formation of loose cell aggregates or colonies suspended in a liquid medium simply because there is insufficient mixing to separate the cells as they replicate. To investigate these different colony-like scenarios, we compared growth rates in two different diffusion situations: solid biofilms and loose liquid aggregates. We kept all other product yield and cell ratio parameters at baseline (1.86 E. coli:1 S. enterica). We sought to find the population size at which a microbial community growth rate was optimal by measuring growth rates in colonies with different numbers of cells using diffusion parameters seen in liquid culture compared to those seen in a solid biofilm with an ECM (Table S1). We found that if the multispecies community formed an ECM (solid colony case), the growth rate was limited by diffusion as colonies increased in size: it increased with increasing colony size up to about 500 cells and then plateaued (Figure 5). Thus, we can expect that if colonies form solid aggregates, we will see them most commonly at this size in microgravity and RWVs. However, if the multispecies community does not form an ECM (liquid colony case), but rather is held together only by the quiescent fluid environment of microgravity, product yield ratios, rather than diffusion, become the limiting growth factor (see Section 3.2.3 below). Thus, for small population sizes, the growth rate in low diffusivity biofilm-like colonies is higher than in high-diffusivity liquid colonies, but the effect is reversed for large populations. In our simulations, the solid–liquid transition occurred with a colony size of about 500 cells. Figure 5. Open in a new tab E. coli Percent Maximum Growth Rate vs. Colony Population in Microgravity. Densely packed multispecies spherical colonies were generated at various sizes. Only one colony was generated per simulation. In solid colonies, self-insulation limited the growth rate beyond a colony of 500 cells. The effect was reduced in liquid colonies.3.1.4. Spatial Dependence Maintained Species Ratios and High Populations The spatial structure becomes more significant with higher populations (~108 cells/mL) and more challenging growth conditions. We made growth harder by increasing the E. coli:S. enterica population ratio, achieving a methionine deficiency and thus having the overall effect of amplifying the dependence on the spatial structure. We visualized the concentration field for acetate after three minutes of simulation (Figure 6). The multispecies colony exhibited growth, while the cells that were random-uniformly distributed grew at a much lower rate. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Acetate diffusion. The symbol C represents the acetate concentration in units of cell equivalents/μm3; note that the color scale is different between the two panels. Compared to other simulations, the E. coli:S. enterica population ratio was increased to a 1956:44 count. Diffusion parameters were set to be equal in (a,b) at a nominal 5 × 10−6 cm2/s. (a) Two-species spherical colony; (b) random uniformly distributed cells. 3.2. Rotating Wall Vessel 3.2.1. Rotating Wall Vessel Increased the Metabolite Utilization Rate To evaluate the effect of RWV-like rotation on metabolite exchange and cell growth rates, we ran simulations using the same parameters as previously tested for microgravity with 108 cells/mL (Section 3.1.2) but implemented gravity and a rotation rate of 10 R.P.M. at a distance of 1 cm from the center of rotation. We found that when the cells were randomly distributed, hydrodynamics only slightly affected RWV growth rates (29% of μmax) relative to true microgravity (27% of μmax). The slight increase was caused by metabolite convective transfer coefficients increasing to 1.17 × 10−3 m/s from 1.06 × 10−3 m/s. However, when the cells were clumped, complicated hydrodynamic effects modulated the growth dynamics and resulted in very different growth between true microgravity and an RWV. We tested a tightly packed colony in RWV conditions (Figure 7) and found that the direction of the acetate gradient was reversed compared to microgravity. In microgravity, the radial diffusion gradient from the colony was negative, which indicated that the colony was producing excess metabolites. In comparison, the gradient from a colony in RWV conditions was positive, which we interpreted to show that growth was not sustainable. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Acetate diffusion in RWV conditions. The color scale (symbol C) represents acetate concentration in units of cell equivalents/μm3. Note that the direction of the diffusion gradient was reversed in this case compared to that found in microgravity (Figure 6a) and that the acetate concentrations decreased. The reversed gradient indicated that the growth rates were unsustainable.In an RWV, the growth rates decreased with time (Figure 8b); in this condition there was higher substrate utilization at initialization, but overall, lower growth rates in a steady state.

The dark shaded region shows the inner quartiles, and the light shaded region shows the outer quartiles. The growth trajectories for the cases depicted in Figure 6a and Figure 7 are graphed here.3.2.2. Separated Colonies Grew Slowly in Both the RWV and Microgravity For this obligately cross-feeding consortium, separated single-species colonies—which may form from adherent cells—are unfavorable for growth compared to multispecies colonies. Because the spatial distribution of the two species in this case was intermediate compared to randomly distributed or densely packed cases, it could provide insight into the dominating growth-limiting mechanism (diffusion vs. convection vs. production), while controlling for population density. We tested the interaction between two single-species colonies in a regime with our baseline intermediate level of diffusion (Table S1) and like the randomly distributed case (Section 3.1.4), found very little difference between community growth rates in microgravity and RWV (Figure 8). This is unlike other cases, such as a single multispecies colony and a 1 g gravity biofilm (Figure 8b). In the separate-species case, the diffusion between colonies was the limiting factor; therefore, the complex dynamics of rotation did not influence the cross-feeding community growth rates.3.2.3. Product Yield Affected Growth Differently in RWV versus Microgravity During a late-stage culture, multispecies colonies allow for the most rapid growth. We returned to simulating a multispecies colony and controlled for the population to measure the growth rate modulation by the balance of diffusion, convection, and production. We probed this relationship by testing the effect of the RWV hydrodynamic environment in simulations with various product yield rates λS (S. enterica) and λE (E. coli). The product yield parameter λx expresses the amount, in cell equivalents, of resource x produced during the growth of the producing species, and the ratio between λS and λE influences both the species ratio and the growth rate of the consortium [29]. We found that the advantage of an RWV over microgravity in terms of growth rate decreased as the product yields increased (Figure 9). However, when using baseline λS and λE values, the overall effect of the RWV hydrodynamic environment was unclear, as it depended on diffusion parameters. We tested two sets of diffusion parameters—those found in biofilms/ECM (Figure 9a) and those found in liquid media (Figure 9b)—and found that the RWV overall increased the growth rates when we assumed low diffusion but decreased growth rates when we assumed high diffusion. Figure 9. Open in a new tab E. coli Percent Maximum Growth Rate with Various Product Yield Parameters λ. If not specified, λ was set to 100% as the default. Densely packed multispecies spherical colonies were generated with a colony size of 2000 cells. Only one colony was generated per simulation. In an RWV, gravity caused the colonies to move as either a rigid unit (regarded as a solid) or each cell moved individually (regarded as liquid). This was not important to the growth rates and was only tested in: (a) an RWV vs. microgravity with low diffusion parameters like those in biofilms. * S. Enterica growth is displayed as it was the faster-growing species, and the diffusion was at an intermediate level. (b) An RWV vs. microgravity with high diffusion parameters like those in liquid media. 3.3. In 1 g Gravity 3.3.1. Gravity Induced the Spatial Structure The reduced sedimentation exhibited by RWV and microgravity may itself change the spatial structure of colonies. To compare the 1 g gravity effect of sedimentation, we placed either a 2D circular biofilm (growth trajectory depicted in Figure 8b) or a spherical biofilm (Figure 10) on the bottom floor of the simulation box. We found that the two conformations had different growth rates, indicating that reduced growth in 1 g gravity could be caused by the geometry of the colony or by its localization on the floor. When cells sediment to the floor, diffusion was restricted upward, where the overall impact depended on the colony geometry. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Natural Convective Flow. A spherical biofilm placed on the simulation floor exhibited solute convective flows in a 1 g gravity condition. Red velocity arrows, in units of s−1, are scaled up by 1000×. The concentration field of acetate is depicted from high to low as red to blue. Fluid simulation boundaries are periodic except on the floor and ceiling of the box.3.3.2. Natural Convective Flow Was Negligible Our simulations also showed that in 1 g, natural convection in a biofilm could result in up to a 20% increased growth rate relative to microgravity. Yet, when the diffusivity was increased to that of liquid media, the growth rate only increased by 3% as the metabolite convective plume diffused. However, it is worth acknowledging that the effect of convection in 1 g (and thus RWV) in our simulation conditions was negligible when compared to particle Brownian convection (Brownian diffusivity ~10−9). When multiplied by a maximum simulation Péclet number of ~0.05, the realistic convective effect was ~0.1–1%. A natural convective flow is displayed (Figure 10) in 1 g gravity.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In this study, we used CFD-DEM modeling to investigate the relationship between the physical environment and the ecological interactions in a microbial community. We chose to simulate a community for which similar research questions were addressed using a very different form of modeling, namely, dynamic flux balance analysis and metabolite diffusion on a lattice, using the COMETS platform [28]. Several contrasts are worth noting. CAMDLES assumes that the internal metabolism time is negligible compared to the time for metabolites to transfer throughout liquid media, and thus we effectively linearized the Monod kinetics equation. Importantly, this approximation is more accurate the lower the diffusivity of metabolites. When simulating low diffusivity, we observed growth rates around 10–20% of μmax, but with high diffusivity, we observed up to 35% of μmax. Accordingly, the general growth results of this study agreed with the ~35% relative growth rate seen in vitro in 1 g gravity [30]. Diffusivity affects the extent to which community growth is dependent on the spatial distribution of cells. Unfortunately, in CAMDLES, we could not model the effects of non-cellular solids, such as an extracellular matrix (ECM), on diffusivity. In vitro and in silico effective diffusivities decrease in solid biofilms [51,52], limiting mass transfer overall. Baseline diffusivities for each metabolite were set as constant in CAMDLES; we were able to change these values to explore differences between biofilm-like and non-biofilm situations, but such changes were global and, therefore, unable to reflect far-field effects outside of colonies within a larger liquid culture vessel. Moreover, the metabolic state of the cells within the biofilm was not resolved, as we assumed all cells to be actively growing. The specific goal of this work was to compare the conditions of artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity and assess which factors led to the most similar results between the two conditions. When solid biofilms form in RWVs, bigger spherical aggregates and more growth are favored relative to those in microgravity. In addition, the ECM effect on diffusion may also increase growth rates compared to those in microgravity. However, if colonies are loose, liquid aggregates, RWVs may reduce the spatial structure of non-motile cells. In summary, RWVs generally amplify the spatial importance of this multispecies microbial community, leading to different aggregation sizes and population ratios. This may change, however, depending on the product yield rates and population proportions of the species. A specific insight that CAMDLES provides is its ability to predict when optimal community growth conditions vary between RWV and microgravity. We found that in the low-population stage of metabolite exchange, planktonic growth was favorable. In our simulations, low-population growth rates increased over time. Later, as cross-feeding metabolites accumulated, planktonic growth rates approached a maximum level. Higher growth rates then only occurred when cells aggregated into either a densely packed biofilm or a loose spherical aggregate. These results parallel observations showing that bacteria can exhibit a planktonic/biofilm transition at a critical point [52], and hint that future CAMDLES studies could offer insight into growth strategies underlying multispecies biofilm formation. In 1 g and RWV cases, forces will likely break apart spherical aggregates and, thus, we would expect to observe mostly spherical, solid-biofilm formation, but organisms might evolve different strategies in microgravity. More work is necessary to determine whether our simulation domain size was large enough to capture the diffusion dynamics of metabolites; although it is large enough to contain a single colony, it did not consider all possible interactions with multiple colonies, except for the simplest, uniform interaction from choosing periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, since we had to prescribe the population size, aggregation, and colocalization of species during the start of the simulation, we were only able to compare relative growth rates in specific conditions. While this gave us the advantage of fine-tuning the experiments to compare diverse culture conditions, it limited the conclusions we could make about long-term growth dynamics. Because of the difference in biological and hydrodynamic timescales, CAMDLES simulations did not run long enough to encounter cell division. However, the timespan was large enough that, except for low population levels, steady-state growth (cell mass accumulation) rates were achieved. At the evolutionary scale, one predictor of the potential size of biofilms or cell aggregates could be the point at which the optimal spatial arrangement transitions from planktonic to aggregated according to different diffusivities. At a certain point, an ECM reduces diffusion and limits growth rates, and thus the colony size, of solid-spherical biofilms. In CAMDLES, this occurs at a colony size of around 500–1000 cells. Thus, we expect that if colonies form solid aggregates, we will see them most commonly at this size in microgravity and RWVs. We underscore that these results hold only for multi-species aggregates and not for single-species aggregates. In contrast to agar plates, where single-species colonies can support each other at a distance, multi-species colonies are necessary for metabolite exchange in liquid media in all three conditions tested (RWV, microgravity, 1 g). One potential explanation concerned two disadvantages: single-species colonies exhibit both the poor diffusive transport that cells in a planktonic culture experience and the intra-colony competition for metabolites that cells in dense communities experience. Yet, CAMDLES simulations do not resolve the long-term spatiotemporal effects of an RWV and 1 g for these scenarios. The long-term effect is simplest in a quiescent environment of microgravity, but interactions between multiple colonies would be more complicated in an RWV sedimenting environment. Overall, we observed that the differences between microgravity and artificial microgravity originated primarily from increased mass transfer caused by RWV convective flows and sedimentation. Even though convection fluid currents may be negligible in 1 g and RWVs, the increased mass transfer coefficient of cells hS resulted in a 9% reduction in the Monod half-saturation constant KS. The spatiotemporal dynamics and substrate utilization of the colony itself were changed by the KS change in both species. However, these mass transfer coefficient increases were minor in comparison to those that would result from Brownian motion if it were implemented, which is significantly more rapid than RWV sedimentation [53]. On the other hand, it is limited in the case of solid biofilms [45]; therefore, we can assert that solid biofilms are more accurately simulated in CAMDLES. Generally, if Brownian motion and cell motility were included in the simulation, we would likely observe a reduction in the relative difference between microgravity and RWV growth rates, and an overall reduction in growth rates due to long-term biomass dispersion throughout the simulation domain.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions CAMDLES is designed to be easily modifiable and extendable. It retains the modularity and support that is featured in the open-source software LAMMPS and OpenFOAM. Further functionality with CAMDLES includes exploring the effect of motility, Brownian motion, cell–cell adhesion, or multisphere support for rod-shaped bacteria on microbial cell dynamics. These general features are already included in LIGGGHTS®/LAMMPS. Additionally, CAMDLES retains the functionality of ParScale, which can model transport and chemical reactions within a spherical particle. This multiscale simulation functionality provides new avenues for microbial agent-based modeling in RWVs. The greatest limitations of CAMDLES stem from size and timespan constraints. The simultaneous fluid, particle, and chemical models incorporated in CAMDLES limit the timescale of simulation to only a few minutes on a personal computer. Performance has yet to be analyzed on high-performance computing clusters. However, CAMDLES retains the highly efficient parallelization found in LIGGGHTS® and CFDEM®Coupling. Added features, such as Brownian motion, bacterial motility, and more complex metabolic cell models, would also add computational overhead. In the future, computational cost can be relieved by developing coarse-grained models for CAMDLES. In conjunction with agent-based models, employing a computationally efficient, coarse-grained modeling approach can provide detailed conclusions regarding the multigenerational evolution and population dynamics of microbial communities. Based on our simulations, we found artificial microgravity to have an amplifying effect on mass transfer and metabolite uptake compared to microgravity and a diminishing effect on sedimentation compared to 1 g gravity. Although not tested in this study, the size and rotation rate of the RWV balance these two factors, and in future work, CAMDLES could be used to explore these experimental variables. Ultimately, the RWV effect on population growth rate is unclear and specific to the microbial community of study. Thus, our package has the potential to serve as a basis to demystify the inconsistencies seen in microbial communities between RWVs and microgravity. This first implementation of CAMDLES serves to demonstrate the importance of a microbial cell’s immediate physical environment on population- and community-level behaviors, especially in the space environment, and in experiments meant to simulate the space environment. CAMDLES represents the type of computational tool capable of providing biologists with unprecedented insight into those interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes.",

For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

Microbial Communities in Space Microbial communities are an integral part of space exploration: they accompany human crew in habitats such as the International Space Station [1] and they will ultimately be used for bioregenerative life support [2], food and pharmaceuticals production [3], and in situ resource utilization [4]. Like all organisms, microbes experience stress in the space environment: studies have documented changes in virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and population diversity [5,6]. However, the mechanisms by which spaceflight induces these responses remain poorly understood. Many of the processes documented for multicellular organisms, such as mitochondrial dysregulation and mechanical unloading [7], do not apply to single-celled organisms; moreover, microorganisms almost invariably live in communities, but few studies of any organisms at any scale have investigated the effects of space conditions on interspecies interactions. Understanding the microbial space response requires an approach that considers the interactions between microbial cells and their environments at relevant spatial scales.1.2. Validating Clinostats for Accurate Artificial Microgravity Conditions Of the stressors present in the spaceflight environment, altered gravity is the feature most likely to affect microorganisms in habitable environments, such as a spacecraft. It is also the feature most difficult to replicate in ground studies. Since spaceflight experiments are costly, logistically difficult, and inaccessible to many researchers, artificial microgravity devices, such as clinostats and rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, are commonly used to replicate microgravity conditions. An RWV is a type of clinostat that is used for cell culture: they are cylindrical culture vessels filled with liquid culture medium that constantly rotate the fluid environment, keeping cells in suspension by continuously changing the orientation of the gravity vector [8,9]. However, there is a fundamental difference between microbial cells and larger organisms in the way that rotation is used to simulate microgravity. For plants grown in clinostats, the constant rotation of the gravity vector results in an average gravity vector of zero over time. For microbial cells, which are believed to be unable to sense gravity directly, it is the ability of the RWV to mimic the unique fluid environment of microgravity that is likely its most important feature [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Understanding the fluid dynamics of the RWV is therefore critical for conducting rigorous research into the effects of spaceflight on microorganisms.1.3. The Microgravity Fluid Environment The loss of natural convection in microgravity causes the fluid environment to be quiescent. Likewise, the idealized RWV fluid environment is under solid-body rotation, with minimal fluid shear and turbulence [8]. However, a disparity is observed in the cellular response when comparing RWV and microgravity conditions, which may be caused by a complex set of factors, including hardware effects, mechanotransduction, and nutrient stress [16,17]. RWVs also exhibit centrifugal sedimentation of cell aggregates, resulting in localization that is different from that found in true microgravity [8]. There are very few commercially available bioreactors; therefore, they are often custom-designed by researchers and unique to each researcher’s experiment. A general lack of knowledge about accurate RWV conditions is a problem that may be one of the sources of contradictory conclusions about the effect of microgravity among cell biological circles, assuming there even is a unified microgravity response on bacterial cells at all [18,19].1.4. The Effect of Microgravity on Microbial Ecology The interaction between the phases—that is, how microbial cells alter their fluid environment and vice versa—is especially important for understanding the behavior of multispecies microbial communities in space. No microbial species lives in isolation. Microorganisms form communities in which different species interact in numerous ways, and one of the interactions most commonly documented is the exchange of metabolites used for growth, often called cross-feeding [6,20]. In a quiescent microgravity fluid environment, reduced mixing could lead to a reduced exchange of metabolites, which, in turn, would shift community dynamics. Although a few microbial community experiments have been done in artificial microgravity [21], there are no previous studies that attempt to validate computational models for a quantitative understanding of microbial community dynamics in these devices. Numerous computational fluid dynamics studies on the macro-scale have been done to validate the ability of clinostats and RWV’s to produce the desired quiescent fluidic environment, but the scope of these studies often includes the fluid phase only, or solid parcel fractions, without metabolite scalar transport [22,23,24,25,26,27]. We sought to fill this gap by building a computational model that integrates both fluid and particle dynamics with biological metabolism and growth to generate predictions of microbial community dynamics in 1 g, microgravity, and RWV conditions. As an initial demonstration, we modeled a community composed of two obligately cross-feeding bacterial species that were previously studied and modeled extensively [20,28,29,30].1.5. Agent-Based Models for Microbial Communities Agent-based models, also known as individual-based models, operate at the resolution of the individual cell. Each agent, i.e., bacterial cell, is given certain rules to follow, placed in an environment, and expected to interact with that environment as well as with other agents. Complex interactions between agents, distributions, and patterns arise from these models, and they are essential for the modeling of microbial communities. Computational agent-based models in the microbial ecology field are actively being developed; one of the latest scientific agent-based simulations is NUFEB [31], which features biological growth kinetics and coupled fluid–solid interaction, but not solute scalar transport. To apply the principles of agent-based modeling to spaceflight and artificial microgravity, we present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), which is an additional package for established, non-biological CFD-DEM software. It is based on the open-source software CFDEM®Coupling [32] and LIGGGHTS® [33], and it brings CFD-DEM modeling capability to RWVs. CAMDLES features include a rotating reference frame simulation environment, the buoyant Boussinesq approximation for natural convective flows, and Monod kinetic metabolic models for calculation of biological growth rates. CAMDLES is also the first agent-based model that directly couples metabolism to mass transfer.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Software Development CAMDLES is dependent on parent software packages to run simulations. Installation involves the addition of the package into the source code of the packages LIGGGHTS® and CFDEM®Coupling. CAMDLES-specific scripts are provided in Supplementary File S1.

An Engineered Cross-Feeding Microbial Community We simulated a previously described (Figure 2) engineered model microbial community involving two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli K12 ΔmetB and Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, that were extensively studied in 1 g but not in space conditions [20,28,29,30,40,41,42,43]. The E. coli strain is auxotrophic for the amino acid methionine and secretes acetate as a secondary metabolic product. The S. enterica depends on the secreted acetate for growth, and the strain was experimentally evolved to secrete methionine to support the E. coli. The coculture is therefore dependent upon cross-feeding when grown in a minimal medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source for growth. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Model microbial community simulated in this study. Adapted with permission from [28]; published by Cell Reports, 2014. When grown in minimal media with lactose, Escherichia coli K12 with a metB gene knockout (E. coli ΔmetB) provides acetate as the carbon growth substrate necessary for a methionine-secreting mutant of Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium (S. enterica) to grow. In exchange, the S. enterica provides the methionine necessary for the E. coli to grow.Because of the organisms’ dependence on the flux of exchanged metabolites, the population dynamics of this model microbial community were found to depend on the spatial structure of the community [20]. For instance, colonies growing on agar medium achieve smaller sizes when located further away from each other, and a third colony blocking the exchange of metabolites between an E. coli colony and an S. enterica colony can cause a complex “metabolic eclipse” effect [28]. We hypothesized that in cross-feeding cocultures, reduced mixing in a quiescent microgravity fluid environment will enable high growth rates when the two species are colocalized in cooperative colonies, but only low growth rates when the species are located distantly from one another. We further hypothesized that in an RWV that simulates microgravity imperfectly, a variety of mechanical and fluid interactions will reduce the impact of colony localization on the growth rate.2.3. Simulation Domain In our simulations, we designed cooperative colonies with varying degrees of population density and localization. Limits in computing power necessarily made simulation timespans much shorter than the generation time of the species; we, therefore, considered the growth rate in terms of the cell mass increase rather than replication, in addition to metabolite production and consumption rates, to assess whether relative growth rates and mass transfer rates were sustainable in our prescribed cocultures. Additionally, CAMDLES does not support changes in diffusion based on solutes or solids, such as an extracellular matrix (ECM); therefore, to simulate the effect of such features, we were constrained to choosing a constant diffusion rate for each solute. We compared three diffusion rates: low diffusion seen in solid biofilms/ECM, intermediate diffusion, and high diffusion seen in liquid media (Table S1). When the distinction is not stated, we set all solute diffusivities to an intermediate 5 × 10−6 cm2/s. We chose our computational domain to be a box that was 300 μm × 100 μm × 300 μm in size, which is the smallest box that can host two cells at an inoculation cell density of 105 cells/mL per species. A fluid parcel was 5 μm × 20 μm × 5 μm with a volume equal to that of ~430 bacterial cells when randomly packed. For some case studies, we varied the cell densities between 105 and 108 cells/mL, exploring a range of microbial population densities commonly achieved with this system in laboratory culture. During simulation initialization, cells were placed in colony-like formations: either a dense spherical mass of cells, or a mass with Gaussian random distributions around a sphere. We also tested random cell placements distributed throughout the computational domain, as well as a cylindrical colony formation as an approximation of a biofilm shape in the case of 1 g gravity. Periodic boundary conditions were set for the non-radial boundaries. In the radial direction, the outer wall was set as an inlet with zero velocity, and the inner wall was a freestream outlet. Cell metabolism was kickstarted by giving each species cell equivalents of product for the other species, i.e., E. coli was given acetate, and S. enterica was given methionine. This is similar to previous studies with this system using modeling with ordinary differential equations and is necessary to enable growth at initial timepoints [29]. In simulations with higher initial cell populations, we gave less starting product, ranging from 10−2 cell equivalents during inoculation, to 10−8 at maximum population. After initialization, each case study ran for two to five minutes, assuming cell growth to be exponential during this time. 2.4. Mechanical Models We assumed the volume and density of a bacterial cell to be the same for both species, namely, E. coli and S. enterica. The volume was calculated as if the cell was a spherocylinder, but was converted to an equivalent Stokes radius (1) and approximated as a sphere in silico. r=3Vcell4π13 (1) The Stokes drag for a very low Reynolds number was applied to each bacterial cell (2). vs⇀ and uf⇀ are the solid and fluid velocities, respectively. In this study, uf in (2) was assumed to be negligible. Because of the low inertia, the solid–fluid momentum coupling caused by the Stokes drag was also assumed to be negligible. Fviscous=6πrμvs−uf (2) In the case of artificial microgravity, the simulation box was placed in a rotating reference frame that matched the rotation rate of the RWV (see Figure 3). Solid-body fluid rotation was enforced at the beginning of the artificial microgravity simulation. The net body frame acceleration a⇀B was derived (3) using centrifugal, Coriolis, gravity, and drag accelerations for the cells in the rotating frame. Archimedean buoyancy was also accounted for in the centrifugal and gravity terms by use of specific gravity. The last term is the viscous drag, with ρfρs being the fluid–solid density ratio and ν being the kinematic liquid viscosity. a⇀B=−ω⇀×ω⇀×rB⇀ 1−ρfρs−2ω⇀×vB⇀+g⇀1−ρfρs−92ρfρsνvs⇀−uf⇀1r2 (3) Figure 3. Open in a new tab Free body diagram of a particle immersed in an RWV. Acceleration terms are described in Equation (3). The simulation domain is a rectangular box in a rotating reference frame.Because rB⇀ spans the range of only ±1.5%, rB⇀ was set to a constant extending to the center of the simulation box. The centrifugal acceleration term was approximated as a uniform body force ac⇀. In this study, we set the radius of rotation to be 1 cm, positioning the computational domain within an imagined culture vessel with a rotation rate of 10 R.P.M. (common for bacteria in artificial microgravity experiments). The rotating reference frame acceleration was also applied to the fluid as a modification of the left-hand side of the incompressible Navier–Stokes Equation (4). The Boussinesq approximation for natural, solutal, and convective flows was applied to the right-hand side of the equation; this assumed that solutal changes in fluid density were small enough to affect buoyancy force only and neither the inertia nor viscosity [40]. For this study, this approximation was included three times, once for each metabolite in the media: acetate, methionine, and lactose. ε is the local fluid volume fraction. ∂εuf⇀∂t+εuf⇀· ∇uf⇀+ εω⇀×ω⇀×rB⇀ +2ω⇀×vB⇀=−ε∇prghρ+ν∇·∇ε uf⇀+εg⇀+ac⇀βSiSi−SiR+… (4) Here, prgh is the modified pressure prgh=p−ρfg ⇀·h ⇀, with h ⇀ as the height of the fluid. The scalar βSi linearly interpolates the difference in the ith solute concentration—compared to a reference concentration SiR—to a difference in fluid density. The cells were assumed to be non-motile strains for simplicity. Non-motile strains show an increased response to microgravity effects compared to motile strains, which may be due to their inability to migrate in their fluid environment [17,19,44]. Moreover, for simplicity, Brownian motion was not incorporated because the phenomenon is independent of the microgravity environment and can be approximated as negligible in solid biofilms and adherent cultures [45]; however, Brownian motion can be incorporated in future implementations of the model since it is a built-in LAMMPS feature. Brownian motion-based diffusion is about one thousand times smaller than solute diffusion [46] and was accounted for long-term in the creation of initial cell Gaussian distributions at the start of the simulations.2.5. Chemical Models We assumed the chemical concentrations within the cell to be uniform at the chemical timestep, making the following Equation (6) suitable for mass transport into the cell. The rate of substrate intake is dependent on the cell surface area AC, the mass transfer coefficient hS, and the substrate concentration difference from the fluid parcel outside of the cell to the inside of the cell. dSCdt=AChS S−SC (5) The mass transfer coefficient hS is related to the local fluid parcel Sherwood number (6). A Sherwood number correlation for CFD-DEM flows that were empirically determined was provided by Deen et al. [47]. hSDM/2r=Sh=7−10ε+5ε21+0.17ReP15 Sc13+1.33−2.31ε+1.16ε2ReP710 Sc13 ; 0 ≤ReP ≤100 (6) ε is the fluid parcel volume fraction, Sc is the Schmidt number, and the particle Reynolds number ReP is between 0 and 100. We assumed that the growth was directly dependent on one substrate only. For E. coli, the rate-limiting substrate was methionine, and for S. enterica, acetate. Because we assumed their growth was rate-limited as a phenomenon of mass transfer, and not of internal cell metabolism, we assumed zero-order kinetics for each cell to convert the substrate into a product once the substrate was transported into the cell [48]. Using biomass yield ratios (Table S1), quantities of substrate were scaled to cell biomass equivalents and then nondimensionalized using the standard cell mass. For S. enterica: 1 cell equivalent Acetate→yields(YMA cell equivalents) Methionine k=μmax,S. enterica (7) compared to E. coli: 1 cell equivalent Methionine+1 cell equivalent Lactose→yields(YAM cell equivalents) Acetate k=μmax,E. (8) 2.6. Biological Models We set up all simulations to occur during the exponential growth phase, and thus all cells were actively growing during the simulation. The Monod kinetic model for single-cell growth, where S is the media bulk substrate concentration, is commonly used in agent-based and metabolic cell models [49]. μ=μmax SKS+S (9) CAMDLES uses an altered Monod kinetic model that directly ties Monod kinetics to rate-limiting mass transfer [48]. Here (10), Sf and SC are the concentrations of the local fluid parcel surrounding the cell and within the cell, respectively. Thus, KS differs from that seen in (9) and those seen in empirical growth data. μ=μmax Sf−SCKS+Sf−SC (10) In Equation (11), the Monod half-velocity constant KS is related to the heat transfer coefficient, the biomass density, the diameter of a spherical cell, the maximal growth rate, the biomass–substrate yield ratio, and the mass transfer coefficient. KS=1hS ρcdcμmax 6YXS (11) At the simulation timescale of a few minutes only, we expected no cell division to occur. Thus, we refer to the growth rate as the individual cell increase in mass. Because we focused on relative growth rates in comparing RWV and microgravity environments, we assumed the metabolism to cause anabolic growth only, with no maintenance or decay terms like those found in NUFEB. This assumption is valid for the mass transfer-based Monod kinetic model (10) [50].3. Results Experiment inputs for all simulations described in this manuscript are given in Supplementary Table S2 and input files are available at the Zenodo data repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6369617). In all simulations, we found that E. coli and S. enterica growth were directly coupled. As one grew, so did the other at a rate based on the ratio of their cell yield ratios: YAMYMA. To simplify the presentation, we depict only one species or metabolite at a time in figures, choosing to represent the species with more growth. Mean growth rates across a species are presented only when the simulation ran to steady-state growth. We report relative growth rates as a percentage of the maximum growth rate: μmax = 1.82 × 10−5 s−1 for E. coli and μmax = 9.09 × 10−6 s−1 for S. enterica. 3.1. Microgravity For the first set of CAMDLES simulations, we tested the hypothesis that co-localization is necessary to enable high growth rates in the simplest environment: no gravity force. We sought to characterize how, in this condition, the spatial arrangement of the microbial community members influenced their ability to exchange metabolites and grow. 3.1.1. Colocalization or Starting Metabolites Could Initiate Growth after Inoculation Laboratory experiments are often initiated with a low population density. We tested an inoculation cell count of one cell per species in the simulation (equivalent to ~105 cells/mL in a larger volume) and assessed the dependence of growth on spatial organization. In a typical experiment inoculated at low density, we can expect some E. coli and S. enterica cells to colocalize via random chance. We compared three levels of spatial organization with the placement of two cells ranging from as close as possible (1 μm) to as far away as possible (218 μm). We observed that at this cell count, the steady-state growth rate depended on the spatial organization under normal conditions (μ = 1.2 × 10−6 s−1, 4.9% of maximum growth rate when close together, compared to 0.8% when far apart). However, we also tested the effect of starting cells with high intracellular levels of the opposite species’ metabolite (0.01 cell equivalents of acetate or methionine, as compared to a nominal 0.00001 cell equivalents), and found that in this situation, the dependence of growth on spatial organization was mostly lost; cells grew at μ = 2.9 × 10−6 s−1 when closest together and at μ = 2.7 × 10−6 s−1 when farthest apart.3.1.2. Early-Phase Growth Rates Increased with Time and Population Density In the early, low-density growth phase (100–283 cells in the simulation, ~106 cells/mL), we assumed that cells randomly divide and distribute throughout liquid media. Thus, we set diffusion rates in the early growth phase to be that of the liquid culture. We tested a counterexample with both 100-cell and 283-cell spherical-Gaussian-packed colonies and found their steady growth rate to be hindered by ~10% compared to a randomly distributed simulation placement (Table S2), likely due to spatial interference for diffusion or Monod competition for metabolites. In contrast, at higher population counts (2000 cells in the simulation, ~108 cells/mL), the exchange of metabolites was most rapid in a compact clump of cells (Figure 4). Overall, we found that for the configuration with random spatial distributions, larger populations reached higher growth rates but with diminishing returns as populations approach densities on the order of ~107 cells/mL, and never reached the growth rates achieved by densely packed cells (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Average E. coli Fold Change in Mass vs. Colony Population in Microgravity. Solid lines represent statistical means, while transparent wedges represent inner quartiles. Either densely packed spherical or randomly distributed colonies were generated at various sizes. Only one colony was generated per simulation. Note: as the population density increased, the standard deviation of growth rates increased, which was likely caused by local spatial heterogeneity within the simulation domain, increasing the likelihood of resource competition.At low cell counts, growth did not reach a steady-state rate, and it may likely never be reached within simulation timescales. Thus, we interpreted non-steady growth as a marker for a growth regime: the only way for average culture growth rates to increase in the early phase is for cells to divide and spread out.3.1.3. Growth Rate Was Limited by Diffusion Rate with Increasing Colony Size In a cross-feeding community, the growth rate is non-linearly dependent on the total number and density of cells: as described above, there are some regimes in which more cells lead to faster growth, but in colonies of many densely packed cells, the biomass and extracellular matrix (ECM) may limit the diffusion rate of metabolites. In an experiment, colonies may densely or loosely pack depending on the gravity platform: microgravity alone may result in the formation of loose cell aggregates or colonies suspended in a liquid medium simply because there is insufficient mixing to separate the cells as they replicate. To investigate these different colony-like scenarios, we compared growth rates in two different diffusion situations: solid biofilms and loose liquid aggregates. We kept all other product yield and cell ratio parameters at baseline (1.86 E. coli:1 S. enterica). We sought to find the population size at which a microbial community growth rate was optimal by measuring growth rates in colonies with different numbers of cells using diffusion parameters seen in liquid culture compared to those seen in a solid biofilm with an ECM (Table S1). We found that if the multispecies community formed an ECM (solid colony case), the growth rate was limited by diffusion as colonies increased in size: it increased with increasing colony size up to about 500 cells and then plateaued (Figure 5). Thus, we can expect that if colonies form solid aggregates, we will see them most commonly at this size in microgravity and RWVs. However, if the multispecies community does not form an ECM (liquid colony case), but rather is held together only by the quiescent fluid environment of microgravity, product yield ratios, rather than diffusion, become the limiting growth factor (see Section 3.2.3 below). Thus, for small population sizes, the growth rate in low diffusivity biofilm-like colonies is higher than in high-diffusivity liquid colonies, but the effect is reversed for large populations. In our simulations, the solid–liquid transition occurred with a colony size of about 500 cells. Figure 5. Open in a new tab E. coli Percent Maximum Growth Rate vs. Colony Population in Microgravity. Densely packed multispecies spherical colonies were generated at various sizes. Only one colony was generated per simulation. In solid colonies, self-insulation limited the growth rate beyond a colony of 500 cells. The effect was reduced in liquid colonies.3.1.4. Spatial Dependence Maintained Species Ratios and High Populations The spatial structure becomes more significant with higher populations (~108 cells/mL) and more challenging growth conditions. We made growth harder by increasing the E. coli:S. enterica population ratio, achieving a methionine deficiency and thus having the overall effect of amplifying the dependence on the spatial structure. We visualized the concentration field for acetate after three minutes of simulation (Figure 6). The multispecies colony exhibited growth, while the cells that were random-uniformly distributed grew at a much lower rate. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Acetate diffusion. The symbol C represents the acetate concentration in units of cell equivalents/μm3; note that the color scale is different between the two panels. Compared to other simulations, the E. coli:S. enterica population ratio was increased to a 1956:44 count. Diffusion parameters were set to be equal in (a,b) at a nominal 5 × 10−6 cm2/s. (a) Two-species spherical colony; (b) random uniformly distributed cells.3.2. Rotating Wall Vessel 3.2.1. Rotating Wall Vessel Increased the Metabolite Utilization Rate To evaluate the effect of RWV-like rotation on metabolite exchange and cell growth rates, we ran simulations using the same parameters as previously tested for microgravity with 108 cells/mL (Section 3.1.2) but implemented gravity and a rotation rate of 10 R.P.M. at a distance of 1 cm from the center of rotation. We found that when the cells were randomly distributed, hydrodynamics only slightly affected RWV growth rates (29% of μmax) relative to true microgravity (27% of μmax). The slight increase was caused by metabolite convective transfer coefficients increasing to 1.17 × 10−3 m/s from 1.06 × 10−3 m/s. However, when the cells were clumped, complicated hydrodynamic effects modulated the growth dynamics and resulted in very different growth between true microgravity and an RWV. We tested a tightly packed colony in RWV conditions (Figure 7) and found that the direction of the acetate gradient was reversed compared to microgravity. In microgravity, the radial diffusion gradient from the colony was negative, which indicated that the colony was producing excess metabolites. In comparison, the gradient from a colony in RWV conditions was positive, which we interpreted to show that growth was not sustainable. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Acetate diffusion in RWV conditions. The color scale (symbol C) represents acetate concentration in units of cell equivalents/μm3. Note that the direction of the diffusion gradient was reversed in this case compared to that found in microgravity (Figure 6a) and that the acetate concentrations decreased. The reversed gradient indicated that the growth rates were unsustainable.In an RWV, the growth rates decreased with time (Figure 8b); in this condition there was higher substrate utilization at initialization, but overall, lower growth rates in a steady state.

The dark shaded region shows the inner quartiles, and the light shaded region shows the outer quartiles. The growth trajectories for the cases depicted in Figure 6a and Figure 7 are graphed here.3.2.2. Separated Colonies Grew Slowly in Both the RWV and Microgravity For this obligately cross-feeding consortium, separated single-species colonies—which may form from adherent cells—are unfavorable for growth compared to multispecies colonies. Because the spatial distribution of the two species in this case was intermediate compared to randomly distributed or densely packed cases, it could provide insight into the dominating growth-limiting mechanism (diffusion vs. convection vs. production), while controlling for population density. We tested the interaction between two single-species colonies in a regime with our baseline intermediate level of diffusion (Table S1) and like the randomly distributed case (Section 3.1.4), found very little difference between community growth rates in microgravity and RWV (Figure 8). This is unlike other cases, such as a single multispecies colony and a 1 g gravity biofilm (Figure 8b). In the separate-species case, the diffusion between colonies was the limiting factor; therefore, the complex dynamics of rotation did not influence the cross-feeding community growth rates.3.2.3. Product Yield Affected Growth Differently in RWV versus Microgravity During a late-stage culture, multispecies colonies allow for the most rapid growth. We returned to simulating a multispecies colony and controlled for the population to measure the growth rate modulation by the balance of diffusion, convection, and production. We probed this relationship by testing the effect of the RWV hydrodynamic environment in simulations with various product yield rates λS (S. enterica) and λE (E. coli). The product yield parameter λx expresses the amount, in cell equivalents, of resource x produced during the growth of the producing species, and the ratio between λS and λE influences both the species ratio and the growth rate of the consortium [29]. We found that the advantage of an RWV over microgravity in terms of growth rate decreased as the product yields increased (Figure 9). However, when using baseline λS and λE values, the overall effect of the RWV hydrodynamic environment was unclear, as it depended on diffusion parameters. We tested two sets of diffusion parameters—those found in biofilms/ECM (Figure 9a) and those found in liquid media (Figure 9b)—and found that the RWV overall increased the growth rates when we assumed low diffusion but decreased growth rates when we assumed high diffusion. Figure 9. Open in a new tab E. coli Percent Maximum Growth Rate with Various Product Yield Parameters λ. If not specified, λ was set to 100% as the default. Densely packed multispecies spherical colonies were generated with a colony size of 2000 cells. Only one colony was generated per simulation. In an RWV, gravity caused the colonies to move as either a rigid unit (regarded as a solid) or each cell moved individually (regarded as liquid). This was not important to the growth rates and was only tested in: (a) an RWV vs. microgravity with low diffusion parameters like those in biofilms. * S. Enterica growth is displayed as it was the faster-growing species, and the diffusion was at an intermediate level. (b) An RWV vs. microgravity with high diffusion parameters like those in liquid media.3.3. In 1 g Gravity 3.3.1. Gravity Induced the Spatial Structure The reduced sedimentation exhibited by RWV and microgravity may itself change the spatial structure of colonies. To compare the 1 g gravity effect of sedimentation, we placed either a 2D circular biofilm (growth trajectory depicted in Figure 8b) or a spherical biofilm (Figure 10) on the bottom floor of the simulation box. We found that the two conformations had different growth rates, indicating that reduced growth in 1 g gravity could be caused by the geometry of the colony or by its localization on the floor. When cells sediment to the floor, diffusion was restricted upward, where the overall impact depended on the colony geometry. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Natural Convective Flow. A spherical biofilm placed on the simulation floor exhibited solute convective flows in a 1 g gravity condition. Red velocity arrows, in units of s−1, are scaled up by 1000×. The concentration field of acetate is depicted from high to low as red to blue. Fluid simulation boundaries are periodic except on the floor and ceiling of the box.3.3.2. Natural Convective Flow Was Negligible Our simulations also showed that in 1 g, natural convection in a biofilm could result in up to a 20% increased growth rate relative to microgravity. Yet, when the diffusivity was increased to that of liquid media, the growth rate only increased by 3% as the metabolite convective plume diffused. However, it is worth acknowledging that the effect of convection in 1 g (and thus RWV) in our simulation conditions was negligible when compared to particle Brownian convection (Brownian diffusivity ~10−9). When multiplied by a maximum simulation Péclet number of ~0.05, the realistic convective effect was ~0.1–1%. A natural convective flow is displayed (Figure 10) in 1 g gravity.4. Discussion In this study, we used CFD-DEM modeling to investigate the relationship between the physical environment and the ecological interactions in a microbial community. We chose to simulate a community for which similar research questions were addressed using a very different form of modeling, namely, dynamic flux balance analysis and metabolite diffusion on a lattice, using the COMETS platform [28]. Several contrasts are worth noting. CAMDLES assumes that the internal metabolism time is negligible compared to the time for metabolites to transfer throughout liquid media, and thus we effectively linearized the Monod kinetics equation. Importantly, this approximation is more accurate the lower the diffusivity of metabolites. When simulating low diffusivity, we observed growth rates around 10–20% of μmax, but with high diffusivity, we observed up to 35% of μmax. Accordingly, the general growth results of this study agreed with the ~35% relative growth rate seen in vitro in 1 g gravity [30]. Diffusivity affects the extent to which community growth is dependent on the spatial distribution of cells. Unfortunately, in CAMDLES, we could not model the effects of non-cellular solids, such as an extracellular matrix (ECM), on diffusivity. In vitro and in silico effective diffusivities decrease in solid biofilms [51,52], limiting mass transfer overall. Baseline diffusivities for each metabolite were set as constant in CAMDLES; we were able to change these values to explore differences between biofilm-like and non-biofilm situations, but such changes were global and, therefore, unable to reflect far-field effects outside of colonies within a larger liquid culture vessel. Moreover, the metabolic state of the cells within the biofilm was not resolved, as we assumed all cells to be actively growing. The specific goal of this work was to compare the conditions of artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity and assess which factors led to the most similar results between the two conditions. When solid biofilms form in RWVs, bigger spherical aggregates and more growth are favored relative to those in microgravity. In addition, the ECM effect on diffusion may also increase growth rates compared to those in microgravity. However, if colonies are loose, liquid aggregates, RWVs may reduce the spatial structure of non-motile cells. In summary, RWVs generally amplify the spatial importance of this multispecies microbial community, leading to different aggregation sizes and population ratios. This may change, however, depending on the product yield rates and population proportions of the species. A specific insight that CAMDLES provides is its ability to predict when optimal community growth conditions vary between RWV and microgravity. We found that in the low-population stage of metabolite exchange, planktonic growth was favorable. In our simulations, low-population growth rates increased over time. Later, as cross-feeding metabolites accumulated, planktonic growth rates approached a maximum level. Higher growth rates then only occurred when cells aggregated into either a densely packed biofilm or a loose spherical aggregate. These results parallel observations showing that bacteria can exhibit a planktonic/biofilm transition at a critical point [52], and hint that future CAMDLES studies could offer insight into growth strategies underlying multispecies biofilm formation. In 1 g and RWV cases, forces will likely break apart spherical aggregates and, thus, we would expect to observe mostly spherical, solid-biofilm formation, but organisms might evolve different strategies in microgravity. More work is necessary to determine whether our simulation domain size was large enough to capture the diffusion dynamics of metabolites; although it is large enough to contain a single colony, it did not consider all possible interactions with multiple colonies, except for the simplest, uniform interaction from choosing periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, since we had to prescribe the population size, aggregation, and colocalization of species during the start of the simulation, we were only able to compare relative growth rates in specific conditions. While this gave us the advantage of fine-tuning the experiments to compare diverse culture conditions, it limited the conclusions we could make about long-term growth dynamics. Because of the difference in biological and hydrodynamic timescales, CAMDLES simulations did not run long enough to encounter cell division. However, the timespan was large enough that, except for low population levels, steady-state growth (cell mass accumulation) rates were achieved. At the evolutionary scale, one predictor of the potential size of biofilms or cell aggregates could be the point at which the optimal spatial arrangement transitions from planktonic to aggregated according to different diffusivities. At a certain point, an ECM reduces diffusion and limits growth rates, and thus the colony size, of solid-spherical biofilms. In CAMDLES, this occurs at a colony size of around 500–1000 cells. Thus, we expect that if colonies form solid aggregates, we will see them most commonly at this size in microgravity and RWVs. We underscore that these results hold only for multi-species aggregates and not for single-species aggregates. In contrast to agar plates, where single-species colonies can support each other at a distance, multi-species colonies are necessary for metabolite exchange in liquid media in all three conditions tested (RWV, microgravity, 1 g). One potential explanation concerned two disadvantages: single-species colonies exhibit both the poor diffusive transport that cells in a planktonic culture experience and the intra-colony competition for metabolites that cells in dense communities experience. Yet, CAMDLES simulations do not resolve the long-term spatiotemporal effects of an RWV and 1 g for these scenarios. The long-term effect is simplest in a quiescent environment of microgravity, but interactions between multiple colonies would be more complicated in an RWV sedimenting environment. Overall, we observed that the differences between microgravity and artificial microgravity originated primarily from increased mass transfer caused by RWV convective flows and sedimentation. Even though convection fluid currents may be negligible in 1 g and RWVs, the increased mass transfer coefficient of cells hS resulted in a 9% reduction in the Monod half-saturation constant KS. The spatiotemporal dynamics and substrate utilization of the colony itself were changed by the KS change in both species. However, these mass transfer coefficient increases were minor in comparison to those that would result from Brownian motion if it were implemented, which is significantly more rapid than RWV sedimentation [53]. On the other hand, it is limited in the case of solid biofilms [45]; therefore, we can assert that solid biofilms are more accurately simulated in CAMDLES. Generally, if Brownian motion and cell motility were included in the simulation, we would likely observe a reduction in the relative difference between microgravity and RWV growth rates, and an overall reduction in growth rates due to long-term biomass dispersion throughout the simulation domain.5. Conclusions CAMDLES is designed to be easily modifiable and extendable. It retains the modularity and support that is featured in the open-source software LAMMPS and OpenFOAM. Further functionality with CAMDLES includes exploring the effect of motility, Brownian motion, cell–cell adhesion, or multisphere support for rod-shaped bacteria on microbial cell dynamics. These general features are already included in LIGGGHTS®/LAMMPS. Additionally, CAMDLES retains the functionality of ParScale, which can model transport and chemical reactions within a spherical particle. This multiscale simulation functionality provides new avenues for microbial agent-based modeling in RWVs. The greatest limitations of CAMDLES stem from size and timespan constraints. The simultaneous fluid, particle, and chemical models incorporated in CAMDLES limit the timescale of simulation to only a few minutes on a personal computer. Performance has yet to be analyzed on high-performance computing clusters. However, CAMDLES retains the highly efficient parallelization found in LIGGGHTS® and CFDEM®Coupling. Added features, such as Brownian motion, bacterial motility, and more complex metabolic cell models, would also add computational overhead. In the future, computational cost can be relieved by developing coarse-grained models for CAMDLES. In conjunction with agent-based models, employing a computationally efficient, coarse-grained modeling approach can provide detailed conclusions regarding the multigenerational evolution and population dynamics of microbial communities. Based on our simulations, we found artificial microgravity to have an amplifying effect on mass transfer and metabolite uptake compared to microgravity and a diminishing effect on sedimentation compared to 1 g gravity. Although not tested in this study, the size and rotation rate of the RWV balance these two factors, and in future work, CAMDLES could be used to explore these experimental variables. Ultimately, the RWV effect on population growth rate is unclear and specific to the microbial community of study. Thus, our package has the potential to serve as a basis to demystify the inconsistencies seen in microbial communities between RWVs and microgravity. This first implementation of CAMDLES serves to demonstrate the importance of a microbial cell’s immediate physical environment on population- and community-level behaviors, especially in the space environment, and in experiments meant to simulate the space environment. CAMDLES represents the type of computational tool capable of providing biologists with unprecedented insight into those interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes.Acknowledgments We thank Will Harcombe and Jeremy Chacón (University of Minnesota) for providing growth and yield parameters for the microbial species and general guidance in understanding their biology.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration.

    "introduction": "Introduction The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) facility was designed and built by NASA and Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC, now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to conduct both fundamental and applied plant research in reduced gravity (Figure 1). Located in the Kibo module on the ISS, the APH was designed for a 10-year mission for collecting physiological data of plant responses to the spaceflight environment. This data will improve our understanding of how terrestrial biology responds to reduced gravity which is useful for enabling the manned exploration of space (National Research Council, 2011; Wheeler, 2017). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab APH Facility: (A) Modular APH subsystems. (B) Overall APH system architecture. Abbreviations are listed in Table 1. This paper describes the results of a hardware validation technology demonstration of the APH facility after its assembly on ISS. Technology demonstrations are simpler than typical flight experiments conducting peer-reviewed science designed to discern differences in plant responses caused by the lack of gravity (Stutte et al., 2015). As such, extensive science and experiment verification tests prior to flight, and a corresponding ground experiment mimicking the culture and environmental conditions experienced on ISS were not conducted. The goal of this hardware validation test was to demonstrate that the APH facility was fully operational and capable of conducting fundamental plant research in microgravity onboard the ISS. The functionality of APH subsystems was verified, as well as the ability of APH to grow two plant species in microgravity during a 7-week period. Minimal ground testing was conducted in an APH engineering development unit (i.e., a similar but non-flight qualified version of the APH) to ensure wheat and Arabidopsis plants would germinate using the watering protocols recommended by the APH design team. The operation of the APH facility was verified by executing experiment profiles that controlled: (1) the environmental conditions during growth of each plant species, (2) chamber CO2 to obtain daily gas exchange data from a plant canopy, and (3) chamber CO2 and light intensity to conduct pre-programmed CO2 drawdown experiments. Spaceflight Plant Research The primary goal of several decades of spaceflight plant research has been to determine if plant growth, development, and reproduction in microgravity is similar to that on Earth (Stutte et al., 2015; Zabel et al., 2016). The goal of this research was to determine if future plant-based Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) growing crops for human colonies on the Moon or Mars (Averner et al., 1984; Wheeler, 2010, 2017) can be sized using 1 g data (Monje et al., 2005). In addition, NASA has recently identified the need for new technologies in space crop production and food safety for supplementing the space diet with fresh leafy green crops in near term ISS, cislunar, and lunar missions (Massa et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2017). Spaceflight plant research is conducted in plant chambers designed to operate in reduced gravity. Previous spaceflight experiments found that indirect effects of microgravity reduce plant growth in space (Musgrave et al., 1997; Monje et al., 2003). These indirect effects include: (1) altered behavior of liquids and gases affecting fluid behavior phenomena, (2) capillary-driven moisture redistribution resulting in poor root-zone aeration, and (3) the absence of buoyancy-driven convection causing poor mass and heat transfer to leaves and plant organs (Musgrave et al., 1997; Musgrave, 2002; Monje et al., 2003; Heinse et al., 2007; Kitaya et al., 2010; Stutte et al., 2015). Other considerations include the limited availability of resources in spacecraft (i.e., mass, power and volume) for plant chambers (Zabel et al., 2016). As a result, plant growth systems for conducting spaceflight experiments [e.g., Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC) and the Biomass Production System (BPS)] were designed to mitigate these secondary effects of the spaceflight environment using forced convection and actively watered root modules that provide well-aerated root zones (Stutte et al., 2015; Zabel et al., 2016). However, these systems were limited by small growth areas available for crop production. Larger plant growth systems are required to overcome the remaining challenges in spaceflight plant research. These challenges are to develop and demonstrate the performance of substrate-free, gravity-independent, water delivery systems to safely grow salad crops in reduced gravity environments for supplementing crew diets (Massa et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2017; Monje et al., 2019; Khodadad et al., 2020). NASA Facilities Enable Future Exploration NASA recently developed two new plant research facilities, Veggie and the APH, for conducting spaceflight plant research on ISS as recommended by the NRC Decadal Survey Study “Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era” (National Research Council, 2011). These facilities have larger plant growth areas (∼0.2 m2) and volumes than previous platforms, and are designed for studying crop production, plant-to-plant interactions, and human-plant-microbial ecosystems using large plants in space (Massa et al., 2016; Khodadad et al., 2020). Veggie uses LED lights, a passive watering system and minimal environmental control consisting of a fan to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. Recently, the Veggie was used to grow nutritious lettuce crops that are safe to eat on ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). In contrast, the APH facility is a research, plant growth chamber that can grow plants under complete environmental control (i.e., spectral quality, light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and ethylene concentration) for life cycles as long as 135 days (Morrow et al., 2016). It incorporates a root module watering design that is similar to those developed for ADVASC and BPS: a substrate-based water delivery system that actively controls matric potential of the root zone (Morrow and Crabb, 2000; Link et al., 2003; Morrow et al., 2004). The APH has the ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) for measuring plant growth during spaceflight, and significantly expands the lighting capabilities (e.g., higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations) available for plant research on ISS. The APH measures CO2 and water vapor fluxes using non-destructive gas exchange techniques demonstrated on the BPS, a predecessor to the APH with an identical CO2 control architecture (Monje et al., 2005). During the ISS Expedition 4 in 2002, the BPS was used to measure the photosynthetic canopy quantum yield (CQY), the conversion of absorbed radiation into gross CO2 fixation, of wheat plant stands in microgravity using the CO2 drawdown technique (Morrow et al., 2004, 2016; Monje et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2005). In that study, the canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY of 21-day-old wheat in microgravity did not differ from 1g controls at moderate light intensities (Stutte et al., 2005). The APH was designed to also measure canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY during spaceflight, however, at higher light intensities than previously available in the BPS. The APH provides lighting with a wide range in spectral quality and a maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1, which is nearly three times higher than was possible in the BPS. Future plant research conducted in Veggie and APH will enable exploration by improving our understanding of how plants, and their associated microbiomes in leaves and roots, grow in the spaceflight environment. This knowledge is useful for developing suitable countermeasures to mitigate potential problems of crop production, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization needed for supporting sustainable and long-term human colonies in space (Wheeler, 2010, 2017). APH Facility The APH facility is a platform that permits the collection of physiological and environmental data to test specific hypotheses on how plant development, gene expression, photosynthesis and respiration, seed formation, plant/microbe interactions, or growth rate may respond to primary effects of microgravity or to secondary effects of the spaceflight environment. The APH is a controlled environment chamber (0.2 m2 by 0.4 m tall) that is teleoperated from the ground, permitting minimal crew involvement to conduct science (Figure 1A). Crew operations are limited to adding water to the APH reservoirs, collecting biological samples, harvesting plants, and conducting periodic system maintenance. Biological samples from shoots and roots grown in APH (such as leaf disks, periodic harvest of plants, etc.) can be returned frozen, or in Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) containing fixatives (e.g., RNAlater), for post-flight analysis on the ground. The growth chamber controls temperature (T; 18–30°C), relative humidity (RH; 50–90%), CO2 concentration (400–5,000 μmol mol–1), wind speed (0.3–1.5 m s–1), spectral quality, and provides the highest light level (up to 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1) of any spaceflight chamber to date (Massa et al., 2016; Zabel et al., 2016). In its baseline configuration, the plants germinate and grow in the APH Science Carrier (SC), a four-quadrant rooting module, using fertilized substrate-based media. Water for filling the reservoirs and wetting the rooting media are initially supplied from ISS potable water, while the majority of the water for sustaining plant growth and operations is provided by condensed humidity that is recycled back to the reservoir. Soil (media) water content is controlled in each rooting quadrant using an active moisture control system. Currently, the baseline configuration of the SC is a single-use 0.2 m2 module that uses a porous granular substrate (1–2 mm arcillite) as rooting media. The media is watered using a manifold of porous ceramic tubes, and moisture content is actively controlled with negative pressure (i.e., suction) to provide optimum root zone water and O2 in microgravity (Monje et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2005; Morrow et al., 2016). The amount of consumable media (∼4 kg per experiment) required by the current APH SC configuration makes this growth system unsustainable for future food production missions beyond low Earth orbit (Monje et al., 2019), but it is adequate for conducting space biology and life-cycle crop production experiments. In space biology experiments, used root modules are often discarded after the plants are harvested because sample return space and down mass from the ISS is limited, however, the APH facility is versatile and can accommodate alternative SC designs for testing future sustainable crop production systems. APH Architecture The APH facility (Figure 1A) consists of the PHARMER (Plant Habitat Avionics Realtime Manager in EXPRESS Rack see Table 1 for abbreviations) that commands several APH subsystems, including the Growth Chamber (GC) and the Growth Light Assembly (GLA). The GC controls ambient CO2 concentration, removes ethylene, and houses the SC root module (Figures 2A–C). The PHARMER subsystem interfaces with other APH subsystems to monitor and control the internal APH environment and fluid levels along with APH thermal and power paths. TABLE 1. List of abbreviations.

Open in a new tab APH Growth chamber subsystems: Science Carrier [SC; (A–E)] and Growth Light Assembly [GLA; (F–I)]. The SC is packed with 1–2 mm arcillite (A–C). The planting, germination and cultivation procedures were demonstrated in APH during ground studies (D). The Flight SC was shipped wrapped in a Tedlar bag (E). The GLA illuminates plants with LED lighting of different wavelengths: blue 455 nm (F), green 530 nm (G), red 630 nm (H), far-red 735 nm, and white 4100 K. The GLA can also provide mixed light recipes: red, blue, and white (I).The APH has two Environmental Control Subsystems (ECS) that physically interface to the EXPRESS Rack Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) system, Avionics Air Assembly (AAA), and Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) (Figure 1B). The ECS units control GC air circulation, filtration, and provide temperature and humidity conditioning. The Water Recovery and Distribution Subsystem (WRADS) operates in conjunction with the APH ECS to provide water to the plant growth chamber. The APH facility has two water reservoirs (Distribution and Recovery) with a combined volume of 3 L. Plants growing in the GC transpire water supplied to the root zone from the 2 L Distribution reservoir. Transpired water is condensed and stored in the 1 L Recovery reservoir. The ECS replenishes the Recovery reservoir with condensate water and the WRADS dispenses water stored in the Distribution reservoir to each quadrant of the SC. The APH Power Distribution Assembly (PDA) is powered via the EXPRESS Rack power interface and provides the appropriate power levels to APH components: PHARMER, GC, GLA, SC, ECS, WRADS, and the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS). The PHARMER also provides the communication path for command uplink to APH and telemetry downlink from APH via the EXPRESS Rack. Commanding of APH from the ground (i.e., teleoperation) was conducted at the Experiment Monitoring Area (EMA) at KSC.",

The planting, germination, and watering protocols for the two species were demonstrated on ISS. The ability to grow Arabidopsis stems, flowers and siliques was accomplished in 6 weeks and the APH’s ability to contain debris during harvest was demonstrated during harvest of the mature Arabidopsis plants.

Recently, the Veggie was used to grow nutritious lettuce crops that are safe to eat on ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). In contrast, the APH facility is a research, plant growth chamber that can grow plants under complete environmental control (i.e., spectral quality, light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and ethylene concentration) for life cycles as long as 135 days (Morrow et al., 2016). It incorporates a root module watering design that is similar to those developed for ADVASC and BPS: a substrate-based water delivery system that actively controls matric potential of the root zone (Morrow and Crabb, 2000; Link et al., 2003; Morrow et al., 2004). The APH has the ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) for measuring plant growth during spaceflight, and significantly expands the lighting capabilities (e.g., higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations) available for plant research on ISS. The APH measures CO2 and water vapor fluxes using non-destructive gas exchange techniques demonstrated on the BPS, a predecessor to the APH with an identical CO2 control architecture (Monje et al., 2005). During the ISS Expedition 4 in 2002, the BPS was used to measure the photosynthetic canopy quantum yield (CQY), the conversion of absorbed radiation into gross CO2 fixation, of wheat plant stands in microgravity using the CO2 drawdown technique (Morrow et al., 2004, 2016; Monje et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2005). In that study, the canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY of 21-day-old wheat in microgravity did not differ from 1g controls at moderate light intensities (Stutte et al., 2005). The APH was designed to also measure canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY during spaceflight, however, at higher light intensities than previously available in the BPS. The APH provides lighting with a wide range in spectral quality and a maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1, which is nearly three times higher than was possible in the BPS. Future plant research conducted in Veggie and APH will enable exploration by improving our understanding of how plants, and their associated microbiomes in leaves and roots, grow in the spaceflight environment. This knowledge is useful for developing suitable countermeasures to mitigate potential problems of crop production, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization needed for supporting sustainable and long-term human colonies in space (Wheeler, 2010, 2017).APH Facility The APH facility is a platform that permits the collection of physiological and environmental data to test specific hypotheses on how plant development, gene expression, photosynthesis and respiration, seed formation, plant/microbe interactions, or growth rate may respond to primary effects of microgravity or to secondary effects of the spaceflight environment. The APH is a controlled environment chamber (0.2 m2 by 0.4 m tall) that is teleoperated from the ground, permitting minimal crew involvement to conduct science (Figure 1A). Crew operations are limited to adding water to the APH reservoirs, collecting biological samples, harvesting plants, and conducting periodic system maintenance. Biological samples from shoots and roots grown in APH (such as leaf disks, periodic harvest of plants, etc.) can be returned frozen, or in Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) containing fixatives (e.g., RNAlater), for post-flight analysis on the ground. The growth chamber controls temperature (T; 18–30°C), relative humidity (RH; 50–90%), CO2 concentration (400–5,000 μmol mol–1), wind speed (0.3–1.5 m s–1), spectral quality, and provides the highest light level (up to 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1) of any spaceflight chamber to date (Massa et al., 2016; Zabel et al., 2016). In its baseline configuration, the plants germinate and grow in the APH Science Carrier (SC), a four-quadrant rooting module, using fertilized substrate-based media. Water for filling the reservoirs and wetting the rooting media are initially supplied from ISS potable water, while the majority of the water for sustaining plant growth and operations is provided by condensed humidity that is recycled back to the reservoir. Soil (media) water content is controlled in each rooting quadrant using an active moisture control system. Currently, the baseline configuration of the SC is a single-use 0.2 m2 module that uses a porous granular substrate (1–2 mm arcillite) as rooting media. The media is watered using a manifold of porous ceramic tubes, and moisture content is actively controlled with negative pressure (i.e., suction) to provide optimum root zone water and O2 in microgravity (Monje et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2005; Morrow et al., 2016). The amount of consumable media (∼4 kg per experiment) required by the current APH SC configuration makes this growth system unsustainable for future food production missions beyond low Earth orbit (Monje et al., 2019), but it is adequate for conducting space biology and life-cycle crop production experiments. In space biology experiments, used root modules are often discarded after the plants are harvested because sample return space and down mass from the ISS is limited, however, the APH facility is versatile and can accommodate alternative SC designs for testing future sustainable crop production systems.APH Architecture The APH facility (Figure 1A) consists of the PHARMER (Plant Habitat Avionics Realtime Manager in EXPRESS Rack see Table 1 for abbreviations) that commands several APH subsystems, including the Growth Chamber (GC) and the Growth Light Assembly (GLA). The GC controls ambient CO2 concentration, removes ethylene, and houses the SC root module (Figures 2A–C). The PHARMER subsystem interfaces with other APH subsystems to monitor and control the internal APH environment and fluid levels along with APH thermal and power paths. TABLE 1. List of abbreviations.

Open in a new tab APH Growth chamber subsystems: Science Carrier [SC; (A–E)] and Growth Light Assembly [GLA; (F–I)]. The SC is packed with 1–2 mm arcillite (A–C). The planting, germination and cultivation procedures were demonstrated in APH during ground studies (D). The Flight SC was shipped wrapped in a Tedlar bag (E). The GLA illuminates plants with LED lighting of different wavelengths: blue 455 nm (F), green 530 nm (G), red 630 nm (H), far-red 735 nm, and white 4100 K. The GLA can also provide mixed light recipes: red, blue, and white (I).The APH has two Environmental Control Subsystems (ECS) that physically interface to the EXPRESS Rack Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) system, Avionics Air Assembly (AAA), and Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) (Figure 1B). The ECS units control GC air circulation, filtration, and provide temperature and humidity conditioning. The Water Recovery and Distribution Subsystem (WRADS) operates in conjunction with the APH ECS to provide water to the plant growth chamber. The APH facility has two water reservoirs (Distribution and Recovery) with a combined volume of 3 L. Plants growing in the GC transpire water supplied to the root zone from the 2 L Distribution reservoir. Transpired water is condensed and stored in the 1 L Recovery reservoir. The ECS replenishes the Recovery reservoir with condensate water and the WRADS dispenses water stored in the Distribution reservoir to each quadrant of the SC. The APH Power Distribution Assembly (PDA) is powered via the EXPRESS Rack power interface and provides the appropriate power levels to APH components: PHARMER, GC, GLA, SC, ECS, WRADS, and the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS). The PHARMER also provides the communication path for command uplink to APH and telemetry downlink from APH via the EXPRESS Rack. Commanding of APH from the ground (i.e., teleoperation) was conducted at the Experiment Monitoring Area (EMA) at KSC.Hardware Validation A timeline of the APH hardware validation events is summarized in Table 2. The APH Flight Unit 1 was shipped in parts to the ISS on two spacecraft and assembled in space by the crew. After APH was powered up, a series of functional tests were conducted over 5 days (November 27 to December 01, 2017) to validate that the hardware was operational. The PHARMER was initiated, then commanding, telemetry, and data retrieval from PHARMER was verified, and each APH subsystem was powered up sequentially. The water reservoirs were filled by the crew with ISS potable water and the environmental control functions (temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, spectral quality, and light intensity), as well as, camera control functions of APH, were validated via commanding from the ground at KSC. At the end of the functional test, an acoustic test was performed and the APH was then configured for conducting a plant experiment. TABLE 2.

Thereafter, the remaining activation steps were executed by an operator via commanding from the ground in the EMA at KSC using software and communications channeled via the Marshall Spaceflight Center. The environmental control systems (ECS-A and ECS-B) that control chamber temperature and humidity were primed and adjusted. Once stable temperature and humidity controls were established, it was verified that the ECS modules could control chamber temperature and humidity at the following setpoints: 23°C/70% RH, 18°C/50% RH, 18°C/90% RH, 30°C/90% RH, and 30°C/50% RH. The GC subsystem was powered to enable the chamber pressure, O2, and CO2 sensors, as well as, initiate CO2 and ethylene control. The APH GLA can generate a wide variety of spectral quality recipes using five LED banks: blue (0–400 μmol m–2 s–1 at 450 nm), green (0–100 μmol m–2 s–1 at 525 nm), red (0–600 μmol m–2 s–1 at 630 nm), white (0–600 μmol m–2 s–1 at 400–740 nm), and near-infrared (0–50 μmol m–2 s–1 at 735 nm). The setpoints for each separate blue, green, white, red, and near-infrared LEDs of the GLA were adjusted one at a time and photographs of the illuminated growth chamber were taken to confirm their operation (Figures 2F–H). The APH operates in several modes: Standby, Manual, and Experiment Profile. To test the Experiment Profile mode, the APH was configured to a desired experimental profile that adjusts daily settings of light intensity, spectral quality (Figure 2I), photoperiod, thermoperiod, relative humidity (RH), CO2 concentration, chamber air speed, ethylene removal, and root zone matric potential. Changes in the timing of these parameters were observed, recorded, and verified using the APH Command log.First Plant Test Overview The main purpose of the first on-orbit plant growth test was to validate that the APH could grow large plants in the spaceflight environment. However, plant growth during spaceflight could not be compared to 1g controls because an identical ground study was not conducted during the validation test. Furthermore, there was no crew time allotted for thinning plants, and there were no provisions to bring back harvested plant samples for analysis on the ground. Instead, non-destructive and non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., photosynthesis and respiration) of an Arabidopsis/wheat canopy were recorded daily. Thus, healthy plant growth was ascertained by comparing images and gas exchange data collected during the life cycle of the plants with known values reported in the literature. The photosynthetic responses of an Arabidopsis/wheat canopy to light and CO2 concentration were measured in microgravity, and compared to literature values from previous studies with wheat conducted at 1g and during spaceflight (Wheeler, 1996; Monje and Bugbee, 1998; Stutte et al., 2005). A SC root module, composed of 4 quadrants packed with 1–2 mm arcillite (Figures 2A–C), was pre-planted with two quadrants of Arabidopsis (WT) cv Col-0 and two quadrants of wheat cv Apogee. The SC planting and watering protocols used were previously tested on the ground in an APH engineering development unit (Figure 2D). For the 1st plant test of APH in microgravity, the pre-planted SC was wrapped in a Tedlar bag, packed in soft foam shipping units, and launched to ISS (Figure 2E) on Cygnus OA-7. During the first plant test, the SC was removed from the Tedlar stowage bag and installed in the APH by the crew. The APH was then teleoperated from the ground to water the plants and collect plant growth data without crew involvement. Experiment profiles, scripts that are executed daily by the PHARMER, were uploaded and implemented to capture a daily record of images, environmental and plant performance data. The experiment profiles were also used for conducting pre-programmed CO2 drawdown experiments to collect non-destructive gas exchange data. The data collected included GC and SC environmental parameters, daily overhead and sideview images, and daily measurements of photosynthesis and respiration. In addition, the experiment profiles controlled the photoperiod in the GC and the media moisture content in each SC quadrant. The drawdown experiment generated plant response curves to altered CO2 concentrations and light intensities. Thus, a major portion of the science capabilities of APH were verified during the first plant test.APH Components Environmental Control Systems (ECS) Two ECS modules, mounted on each side of the growth chamber, control chamber temperature, humidity, and air flow (Figure 1A). Each ECS first condenses/humidifies chamber air using moist porous ceramic cups under suction, and then heats the air to the desired setpoint temperature. Each unit is independently monitored and controlled, and has the capability to independently control temperature in the growth chamber from 18 to 30°C (±1°C), and relative humidity from 50 to 90% (±5%). Preparing the two ECS units for operation required priming with water (∼0.8 L) up to the porous ceramic cups in order for RH and temperature control to operate efficiently. Pressure control setpoints for the porous cups were gradually set to start recovery (or addition) of water to adjust the relative humidity of the airflow through each unit. The ECS modules mix the air in the growth chamber by forced convection using fans that remove air from the top of the growth chamber above the plants and return it into the chamber at plant level from opposing sides of the chamber. Fan speeds are controllable from 0.3 to 1.5 m s–1 at 0.1 m s–1 increments. Replaceable HEPA filters prevent particulates and plant debris from contaminating the internal components of the ECS modules during nominal operating conditions. A goal of the first plant experiment was to demonstrate how the ECS filters would capture plant debris, especially that generated during the growth and harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants.Science Carrier (SC) – Preparation and Planting The APH WRADS independently controls moisture content of the four quadrants in the SC (Morrow et al., 2016). The WRADS supplies water to each quadrant via a manifold that has four porous ceramic tubes (Refractron, Newark, NY, United States) embedded into the growth media. Each quadrant is first saturated and then drained to a desired moisture content. The WRADS measures the matric potential of the media in each quadrant using a pressure sensor, and root zone moisture setpoint is controlled by removing/adding water to the root module. Two additional capacitance-based moisture sensors (ECH2O EC-5, METER Group, United States) located vertically in each quadrant measure the corresponding volumetric moisture content of the media. One sensor is located above and the other is located below the porous tubes delivering water from the WRADS (Figure 2A). These sensors are not part of the moisture control loop but provide an independent method to gauge adequate watering of the media. Media Preparation The SC used a porous granular substrate media (arcillite; Turface Pro League Elite, Profile Products, LLC) to provide root anchoring, as well as storage and delivery of water, oxygen, and nutrients to plant roots. Arcillite was first sieved to a particle size of 1–2 mm and then washed with DI water to remove dust. Washing the arcillite was necessary for both crew safety and for reducing the potential for particulate clogging of the porous tubes in the SC quadrants. Sifted and washed arcillite was autoclaved in a covered tray for 30 min and dried in a forced air oven at 70°C for a minimum of 72 h until thoroughly dry. Dried and sterile 1–2 mm arcillite was weighed (∼990 g per quadrant; equivalent to 1.6 L) into clean ziplock bags, and mixed gently with 7.5 g/L of Type 180, 18-6-8 Nutricote (Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, United States) time-release fertilizer pellets. A 1.6 L volume of media filled one of the four quadrants to the proper density and height in the SC (Figures 2A,B). The arcillite was carefully tamped down around the temperature and moisture sensors, as well as the porous watering tubes residing in each quadrant, to prevent movement of the clay particles during launch (Figure 2C). Once all four quadrants were filled with media, two quadrants were planted with Arabidopsis wild-type (WT) cv Col-0 seeds and two quadrants planted with wheat cv Apogee seeds. The planting and germination protocols for growing for Arabidopsis or wheat were different, so each system is described individually. Arabidopsis Planting System Extensive ground testing was conducted to determine the optimum planting and germination protocols for growing Arabidopsis on APH. The chosen protocol for germination of Arabidopsis employed a single layer of medical gauze. An individual medical gauze sheet (Covidien Curity, 4 in × 4 in, 4 ply; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was unfolded and placed on top of the tightly packed arcillite. The gauze was covered with washed and sterilized open-celled Roylan orthopedic foam (Performance Heath, Warrenville, IL, United States). The foam covered the majority of each quadrant except for precut strips covered with gauze where the seeds were planted. The foam, medical gauze, and arcillite were secured in place by a polycarbonate cover that contained three centered rows for planting and holes for aeration of the entire quadrant. Supplementary ground testing of this planting and germination protocol was performed in collaboration with Washington State University (WSU) scientists to ensure the success of the first scientific study to be conducted on APH (PH-01): ‘An Integrated Omics Guided Approach to Lignification and Gravitational Responses: The Final Frontier’ (Lewis et al., 2020). Wild Type (WT) Arabidopsis seeds cv Col-0 were surface sanitized with successive 70 and 95% ethanol washes, followed by overnight drying, prior to gluing onto the medical gauze. Individual seeds were first dipped onto a small drop of a sterile 1% guar gum solution, then individually glued onto the medical gauze within each of the two Arabidopsis quadrants. In each row of the quadrant, 12 equally spaced planting locations were planted with two seeds. There was no crew time allotted for thinning operations during the validation mission so only two seeds per location were planted.Apogee Wheat Planting System The planting and germination protocols for wheat were adopted and modified from those used in BPS during the PESTO experiment (Monje et al., 2005). Apogee wheat seeds (provided by Bruce Bugbee, Utah State University) were planted in two quadrants using CapMat II wicks (16.5 cm by 4 cm; Phytotronics, Inc., Earth City, MO, United States). The wheat seeds used were not sanitized because it was found that the ethanol wash protocol used for the Arabidopsis seeds decreased wheat seed germination down to 20%. Ten seeds were planted in each row for a total of 30 seeds in each quadrant. The wicks and Roylan foam were autoclaved using a 20 min dry cycle. Two CapMat strips were placed together inside slits cut in the Roylan foam to form two capillary wicks that held the seeds during launch and growth in the ISS. Each side of the seed was dipped in sterile 1% guar gum, and the seeds were planted with the embryo tip downward into the arcillite substrate, positioned so that the glued edges of the seeds were in contact with the CapMat II wicks. The wheat quadrants were located closest to the door of the APH growth chamber during the ISS flight experiment to allow plant height determination using the side-viewing IR camera.Science Carrier Flight Configuration Following seeding the SC was dried overnight in a sterile laminar flow bench to allow the glue holding the seeds to dry. Drying in the flow bench minimizes contamination of the planted SC with airborne contaminants. The SC was then sealed within a large, gas impermeable Tedlar bag (SKC, Inc., Eighty Four, PA, United States) (Figure 2E), and packed in foam for launch to the ISS.First Plant Test Background: Gas Exchange Measurements In plant ecophysiology, gas exchange systems are used for measuring carbon and water vapor fluxes from photosynthetic organisms (Pearcy et al., 1989; Monje and Bugbee, 1998, 2019). These techniques have been used in the 1980s and 1990s during NASA’s Advanced Life Support Program to measure crop radiation use efficiencies and transpiration rates for estimating the size and feasibility of future BLSS (Averner et al., 1984; Rummel and Volk, 1987; Bugbee and Salisbury, 1988; Wheeler, 2010). The APH was designed to permit the measurement of photosynthetic and transpiration rates from the plants within the GC. The system for controlling the CO2 concentration of the APH GC provides a means to measure canopy photosynthesis non-destructively using gas exchange techniques pioneered by ecophysiologists in the 1960s (Lange et al., 2001). Plants remove CO2 from the chamber atmosphere via photosynthesis when illuminated and add CO2 via respiration in the dark. The APH utilizes a semi-closed gas exchange system to maintain chamber CO2 setpoint, and acts like a closed system when CO2 control is disabled. In the semi-closed system, the chamber CO2 setpoint during the photoperiod is maintained by injecting small, known volumes of CO2 into the chamber and the photosynthetic rate is determined from the number of CO2 pulses injected over a given time period, but chamber leak rate must be known (Pearcy et al., 1989). At night, CO2 control is disabled and CO2 concentration rises due to dark respiration to a level higher than the daytime setpoint. At the start of the photoperiod when CO2 control and ethylene scrubbing are disabled, the chamber operates in closed mode and photosynthesis draws down the chamber CO2 concentration down to the daytime setpoint. This daily CO2 drawdown was used to measure photosynthetic rates during the development of the plant canopy growing in the APH.Spaceflight Growth Experiment The primary goal of the first plant test was to verify that plants can be grown normally within the APH hardware on ISS. A principal investigator who has been awarded a spaceflight experiment utilizing the APH facility chooses the plant species, the environmental conditions for the life cycle, and supplies a pre-planted SC root module. The proposed science objectives are then demonstrated on the ground during science and experiment verification tests. The SC is then launched to ISS, inserted in the APH chamber by the crew, its water lines are connected to the WRADS, and temperature and soil moisture sensors from each quadrant are connected to the PHARMER. The crew closes the APH door and thereafter, the APH is configured by experiment profiles, which control the growth chamber environment and the root zone moisture level for the duration of the life cycle of the chosen plant species. The first plant test was conducted in two stages using two plant species (Table 3). The Arabidopsis quadrants were watered first in order to verify the procedures for priming, germinating, growing Arabidopsis to maturity, and harvesting in microgravity in preparation for the PH-01 experiment. The Arabidopsis plants were grown for 17 days under low light (150 μmol m–2 s–1), low CO2 concentration (400 μmol mol–1) and a 16:8 photoperiod (Table 3), which are typical environmental setpoints for Arabidopsis. The germination rate of the Arabidopsis plant growth test was only 58%, which was significantly lower than the 80% germination rate observed in early germination tests on the ground. The germination rate reported is really a survival rate because germinating Arabidopsis plants are small and cannot be distinguished from background by the overhead camera. A greater number of plants may have actually germinated, but two reasons contributed to poor survival. Typically five plants are seeded per position, but only two were planted in this validation test to prevent overcrowding because crew time for thinning was not available. Poor survival was also observed due to uneven water distribution during priming of the SC and/or overwatering caused by microgravity-induced moisture redistribution phenomena during the early growth phases. These results were later addressed by the PH-01 research team during the implementation of their spaceflight experiment. TABLE 3. Environmental setpoints and germination rates during the first plant test on APH. Environment Arabidopsis Wheat Units Light intensity (PPFD) 150 ± 1.2 600 ± 1.1 μmol⋅m–2 ⋅s–1 Photoperiod (Light:Dark) 16:8 20:4 hr CO2 concentration 400 ± 5.3 1500 ± 6.0 μmol mol–1 Temperature (Light:Dark) 22:18 (± 0.13) 23:23 (± 0.06) °C Humidity (%) 65 ± 0.9 75 ± 0.8 % Experiment duration 48 (6 wk) 33 Days Planting area 0.1 0.1 m2 # Plants grown/Planted 21/36 48/60 Plants Germination rate 58 80 % Open in a new tabThe wheat quadrants were imbibed when the Arabidopsis plants were 17 days old and grown at high light intensity (600 μmol m–2 s–1), elevated CO2 concentration (1500 μmol mol–1), and a 20:4 photoperiod (Table 3). Thus, Arabidopsis grew at high light, elevated CO2, and a longer photoperiod for ∼4 additional weeks, which are not normal conditions for this species. Furthermore, watering of the Arabidopsis quadrants was discontinued during the last week of Arabidopsis growth to minimize their contribution to gas exchange measurements made with wheat. The Arabidopsis plants were harvested 6 weeks after planting, during flowering to demonstrate the ability of the APH ECS filter system to contain plant debris during harvest. Images revealed that plant debris was successfully trapped on the inlets to the ECS modules. These modules recirculate chamber air through an inlet protected by a screen and a HEPA filter. A video camera was placed outside the APH to detect debris flying out of the chamber; only one small flower was observed to leave the APH and it was captured by the crew. The inlets to the ECS modules were cleaned with a vacuum after the validation test was completed. The germination rate of the wheat seeds was 80%, which was lower than the 92–97% germination rate observed in the BPS (Stutte et al., 2005). The wheat was grown until anthesis at 33 days after planting and grew next to the Arabidopsis plants for ∼25 days. The wheat plants imposed an increased water production load on the environmental control system (i.e., ECS) and an increased water demand load on the root zone watering system of APH (i.e., WRADS). The wheat canopy tested if the APH subsystems used for controlling chamber CO2 concentration and water fluxes were sized appropriately to maintain environmental setpoints when large plants are grown under microgravity conditions.Lighting System Determining the light level regime within the growth chamber is important for interpreting photosynthetic measurements made in the APH because plant height changes during development. The GLA setpoints of the APH correspond to a light intensity measured 10 cm below the LED panel. However, the actual light intensity at plant height is determined by the degree of light attenuation versus height within the GC and by the height of the plants. The Arabidopsis plants were grown at a light level of 150 μmol m–2 s–1 with a spectral quality composed of blue, green, and red LED illumination (Figure 3A, BGR, black line), similar to that of Veggie (Figure 2I). The wheat/Arabidopsis canopy in the APH was grown at 600 μmol m–2 s–1 using a 1:1 ratio of white and red LEDs (Figure 3A, WR, red line). Two additional spectral compositions were used to study the light regime and to illustrate the spectral range provided by the APH GLA: (1) white LED supplemented with red and blue LEDs (Figure 3B, WRB red line), and (2) red and blue LEDs (Figure 3B, RB, black line). A comparison between the WRB and RB spectra shows that white LEDs supply additional blue and red light plus substantial amounts of green light, which penetrates deeper into plant canopies than red and blue light (Kim et al., 2006). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab APH GLA spectra using White, Blue, Green, and Red LEDs: (A) Spectral quality during Arabidopsis (BGR, black line) and wheat (WR, red line) plant tests. (B) Spectral quality during the CO2 drawdown experiment (WRB, red line). Comparing the WRB and RB (black line) spectra shows that white LEDs supply additional blue and red light plus substantial amounts of green light.The APH ground unit was used to measure the degree of light attenuation for several GLA setpoints (900, 600, and 300 μmol m–2 s–1) of WRB (Figure 4, inset, solid lines) and RB (Figure 4, inset, dashed lines) illumination. These light attenuation curves show that light level below the GLA decreases in a linear fashion. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Light attenuation and plant height within APH. Light attenuation under WRB (solid lines) and RB (dashed lines), measured at 900 (blue), 600 (yellow), and 300 (green) μmol m– 2 s– 1 GLA setpoints, decreases linearly in APH. Wheat canopy height was measured using the grid of the APH door cover. Wheat was 15, 23, and 37 cm tall at 11, 20, and 31 DAP, respectively. The wheat plants were harvested after 33 DAP by Astronaut Norishige “Nemo” Kanai (Image Courtesy NASA used for informational purposes without explicit permission).The plant height during development of the wheat canopy on ISS was estimated from images acquired using the side-facing IR camera. The height of the wheat canopy was measured using the grid placed on the inside of the APH door cover (Figure 4, bottom panel). The grid measures the height from the bottom of the GC to the GLA (45 cm), and the SC occupies 5 cm inside the GC, which leaves 40 cm between the top of the SC to the GLA. The plants were 15 cm tall (25 cm below the GLA) at 11 DAP; 23 cm tall (17 cm below GLA) at 20 DAP; wheat heads were observed at 37 cm (3 cm below GLA) on 31 DAP (Figure 4). For example, the plant heights at 11, 20, and 31 DAP correspond to upper canopy light levels of 337, 459, and 533 μmol m–2 s–1 at a GLA setting of 600 μmol m–2 s–1 under WRB illumination.CO2 Drawdown Experiments Chamber Leak Rate A CO2 drawdown experiment was performed following installation of the dry SC root module on the ISS to determine chamber leak rate of the APH GC. Chamber CO2 was raised to 2,000 μmol mol–1, CO2 control and ethylene scrubbing were disabled for 3 hr and chamber leak rate was measured according to Acock and Acock (1989). The leak rate of APH on ISS was 5% h–1, which is consistent with leak rates measured during ground studies. The leak rate must be known to correct changes in chamber CO2 during the CO2 drawdowns used to measure canopy photosynthesis.CO2 Drawdown Technique The CO2 drawdown technique is a non-destructive and non-invasive gas exchange technique for measuring photosynthetic rates from changes in chamber CO2 concentration. The CO2 control system operates the GC as a closed gas exchange system to determine: (1) daily canopy photosynthetic rates, and (2) response curves of photosynthesis to chamber CO2 concentration and to light intensity. During a CO2 drawdown curve, chamber CO2 is raised to 2,000 μmol mol–1, the plants are allowed to acclimate at the desired light level for ∼1 h, then chamber CO2 and ethylene control are disabled and a photosynthetic CO2 drawdown occurs. Ethylene control must be disabled because the permanganate-filled Purafil SP beads used to control ethylene absorb significant amounts of CO2 (Purafil, Inc., Doraville, GA, United States). Net photosynthetic carbon uptake consumes CO2 and chamber CO2 is reduced at a rate that is proportional to the incident light level. The change in CO2 concentration between 2,000 to 1500 μmol mol–1 is used to calculate canopy photosynthesis at a saturating CO2 concentration. For a CO2 drawdown experiment, repeating drawdown curves are conducted at descending light levels ending in a measurement of dark respiration.Daily Canopy Carbon Fluxes in APH After the 1st week of wheat growth, a single CO2 drawdown curve was programmed into the daily experiment profiles to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis at a saturating CO2 concentration of 1500 μmol mol–1. During the 4 h dark period, CO2 control was disabled for 2 h, allowing CO2 concentration to rise rapidly above 2,000 μmol mol–1. The initial rise in CO2 concentration vs. time during this period provided a measure of canopy dark respiration rate (Figure 5, APH Rdark, blue circles). During the remaining 2 h of darkness, CO2 control was enabled at a setpoint of 1700 μmol mol–1. When the lights came on, CO2 control and ethylene scrubbing were disabled to initiate the drawdown curve. After 1 h, CO2 and ethylene control were enabled to re-establish a setpoint of 1500 μmol mol–1. The decrease in CO2 concentration vs. time during the drawdown period is a measure of maximal canopy net photosynthetic rate (Figure 5, APH Pnet, open circles). A 1 h limit for the daily CO2 drawdown was used because at high light the canopy can deplete CO2 rapidly, and it is imperative to prevent chamber CO2 concentration from dropping below the CO2 compensation point (∼100 μmol mol–1), which may cause photooxidative damage to the plants. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Daily photosynthesis and respiration measurements. Daily APH Pnet measured from daily CO2 drawdown curves and dark respiration (Rdark) rates increased with time as the wheat plants grew and fixed more CO2. The wheat/Arabidopsis canopy had similar gas exchange rates as wheat plants grown in spaceflight during BPS 2002 and on the ground by Wheeler, 1996.The daily canopy photosynthetic rates (Figure 5, APH Pnet, open circles) include CO2 fixation from 48 wheat and 14 Arabidopsis plants contained within the APH GC, each planted in 0.1 m2 (i.e., 50%) of the root module (Figure 5, inset 19 DAP APH). Donahue et al. (1997) reported a photosynthetic rate of 10–12 μmol m–2 s–1 for Arabidopsis grown at the same light intensity. Using these values, the Arabidopsis is estimated to have contributed between 40–58% of APH Pnet observed during the first 15 DAP of wheat growth. The actual contribution from the Arabidopsis plants may have been less because they were senescing. After 20 DAP, the canopy photosynthesis was assumed to be primarily (∼80–90%) from the wheat plants, as watering of the two Arabidopsis SC quadrants had been discontinued and the Arabidopsis plants were beginning to desiccate. APH Pnet after 26 DAP was entirely from wheat because the Arabidopsis plants were removed from the GC, however, dark respiration was probably influenced by root respiration from the desiccating Arabidopsis roots. The daily canopy net photosynthetic rates measured in APH were compared to two wheat canopy photosynthetic experiments. The first is a wheat ground study conducted at a light intensity of 500 μmol m–2 s–1 using High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps (Figure 5; Wheeler 1996, red triangles). Wheeler (1996) reported photosynthetic rates of 7, 12, 20, and 25 μmol m–2 s–1 at 15, 20, 25, and 30 DAP, respectively. The second study is the 2002 PESTO spaceflight experiment conducted in the BPS using Cool White Fluorescent (CWF) lamps at a light intensity of 280 μmol m–2 s–1 (Figure 5, BPS 2002, black line) (Monje et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2005). The daily APH Pnet rates from 7 to 15 DAP (Figure 5, white circles) were slightly lower than the rates measured in BPS (Figure 5, BPS 2002, black line), probably due to higher root respiration from the deeper and larger APH root modules. From 15 to 29 DAP, the daily Pnet matches the photosynthetic rates of wheat grown at 500 μmol m–2 s–1 (Figure 5; Wheeler 1996, red triangles). After 15 DAP, daily Pnet remains higher than was observed in the BPS. Photosynthesis in BPS was constant from 15 to 21 DAP because the wheat flag leaves were larger than the height of the BPS chamber, which caused the upper leaves to fold over each other resulting in self-shading (Figure 5, inset 21 DAP BPS), thus preventing higher penetration of light into the canopy. In contrast wheat grown in APH allowed more light to penetrate into the canopy (Figure 5, inset 26 DAP APH), thus Pnet increases with age at a rate similar to that reported by Wheeler (1996). After 26 DAP, daily Pnet was lower because the photosynthetic contribution from Arabidopsis was removed. These observations suggest that the wheat/Arabidopsis canopy grown during the first plant test of the APH had similar gas exchange rates as wheat plants grown on the ground.APH CO2 Drawdown Experiment A CO2 drawdown experiment was conducted to verify that the APH can measure responses of canopy photosynthesis to CO2 concentration and light intensity. The CO2 drawdown experiment was conducted when the wheat plants were 24 days old and the Arabidopsis plants were 41 days old at the daily settings of air temperature (23°C) and chamber humidity (75%). Two CO2 drawdown experiments were conducted on consecutive days to determine the repeatability of these measurements. Each experiment consisted of a series of seven CO2 drawdown curves at decreasing light levels. The experiment profile changed the GLA setpoints for each LED (Table 4), as well as, enabled/disabled CO2 control and disabled ethylene scrubbing functions automatically. The plants were illuminated with WRB LEDs that provided a constant red:blue ratio of 5 (Figure 3B, WRB, red line). The incident radiation at canopy height (PPFD, Table 4) was held constant during each drawdown. The PPFD was estimated using the image analysis described in section “Lighting System” (Figure 4). TABLE 4. Setpoints for the APH CO2 Drawdown Experiment1.

The first drawdown curve at the highest GLA setpoint (900 μmol m–2 s–1) was conducted after the dark period from the previous day (4 and 28 hrs; Figure 6B). During subsequent drawdowns, the CO2 control system was enabled for 1 hr to raise chamber CO2 back to 2,000 μmol mol–1 (Figure 6A, gray box), and CO2 was indeed injected during those times (Figure 6A, orange line). However, the CO2 injection rate during the second and third drawdowns (at the 800 and 600 μmol m–2 s–1 light intensities) was not sufficient to overcome the rapid photosynthetic rates at the high light levels (7 and 10 hrs, Figure 6B, black line), and chamber CO2 concentration did not reach the CO2 setpoint (Figure 6B, green line) in 1 h. As PPFD decreased, chamber CO2 reached the setpoint and even increased above it due to respiration. The same trends were observed on the second day. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab APH CO2 Drawdown Experiment. (A) Stepwise changes in GC light intensity (blue line) and (B) CO2 concentration (black line) during the two consecutive CO2 Drawdown experiments. The CO2 control switch [(A,B), gray line] enabled CO2 injections [(A), orange line] to raise chamber CO2 to 2,000 μmol mol– 1 before each drawdown. CO2 concentration decreased when CO2 control was disabled due to photosynthetic CO2 uptake. The CO2 injection rate during the second and third drawdowns was not sufficient to overcome canopy Pnet at higher light levels and chamber CO2 concentration [(B), black line] did not reach the CO2 setpoint [(B), green line] in 1 h. As PPFD decreased, chamber CO2 reached the setpoint and even increased above it due to respiration.The drawdown curves obtained at each light level were used to calculate Pnet from the change in chamber CO2 concentration during each 5 s interval (Figure 7, inset, dCO2 5s–1). The dCO2 data was plotted vs. CO2 concentration, fitted with a logarithmic curve, and converted to a photosynthetic CO2 response curve assuming a 0.1 m2 planted area and a 100 L volume for the APH chamber. For simplicity, the approach used did not correct the dCO2 data for chamber leak rate, and it was assumed that the Arabidopsis plants did not contribute to the photosynthetic CO2 uptake. The resulting response curves of canopy photosynthesis to CO2 concentration for the four highest light levels are shown in Figure 7. The response curves measured during the first and second days are shown as solid and dashed lines, respectively. These CO2 response curves show that photosynthetic CO2 uptake is limited at lower CO2 concentrations, and that maximal rates of photosynthesis are affected by the incident radiation absorbed by the canopy (Figure 7). For comparison, the CO2 response curve measured during PESTO at 280 μmol m–2 s–1 PPFD (Figure 7, BPS 2002, black circles) is shown (Stutte et al., 2005). A single data point for the net photosynthetic rate of wheat measured at the same stage of development using HPS lamps at 1400 μmol m–2 s–1 PPFD and 1200 μmol mol–1 CO2 (Figure 7, blue triangle) shows that canopy photosynthesis can increase further at higher light levels (Monje and Bugbee, 1998). FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab CO2 response curves of canopy photosynthesis during the CO2 drawdown experiment: Changes in chamber CO2 concentration (inset, dCO2 5s– 1) from drawdown curves measured at constant PPFD were plotted vs. CO2 concentration, fitted with a logarithmic curve, and converted into photosynthetic CO2 response curves. Response curves measured during consecutive days are shown as solid and dashed lines. For comparison, the CO2 response curve measured during PESTO is plotted (BPS 2002, black circles) and Pnet of wheat increases at higher light levels (Monje and Bugbee, 1998, blue triangle).Canopy light response curves describe how canopy photosynthetic rates, and therefore, crop growth rates vary as a function of incident radiation (Bugbee and Salisbury, 1988). They also provide information on the maximum photosynthetic capacity and CQY. A light response curve for the wheat/Arabidopsis canopy was constructed by plotting the gross photosynthetic CO2 uptake rate vs. absorbed radiation (Figure 8). Gross photosynthesis was calculated from the sum of Pnet at 1500 μmol mol–1 CO2 (Figure 7) and the measured canopy dark respiration (Rdark). The absorbed radiation was calculated assuming the wheat plants absorbed 95% of the incident radiation (Monje and Bugbee, 1998). The CQY, the slope of the plot of gross photosynthesis vs. absorbed PPFD, represents the photosynthetic conversion of absorbed radiation into fixed CO2. The CQY of the wheat/Arabidopsis canopy measured in APH (0.055; Figure 8, WRB LEDs, purple open circles) was compared to values of wheat CQY reported in the literature: Wheeler, 1996 (0.051; Figure 8, HPS lamps, red diamonds), BPS 2002 (0.035; Figure 8, CWF lamps, black squares), and Monje and Bugbee, 1998 (0.053; Figure 8, HPS lamps, blue triangle). The CQY values used in this comparison were determined from reported values of Pnet, Rdark, and incident PPFD (Wheeler, 1996; Monje and Bugbee, 1998; Stutte et al., 2005). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Light response curves of APH canopy photosynthesis: The APH CQY, the slope of gross photosynthesis vs. absorbed PPFD, represents the photosynthetic conversion of absorbed radiation into fixed CO2. The CQY of the wheat/Arabidopsis canopy measured in APH (WRB LEDs, purple open circles) is higher than reported in BPS 2002 (CWF lamps, black squares), but comparable to literature values of wheat CQY: Wheeler, 1996 (HPS lamps, red diamonds), and Monje and Bugbee, 1998 (HPS lamps, blue triangle).The calculated APH CQY is higher than that measured in the BPS, probably because the wheat plants in the BPS were self-shaded. It is also slightly (4–8%) higher than the CQY of wheat grown under HPS lamps at 1g. The reason for these differences is that the gas exchange data collected includes error in the estimated incident radiation at the top of the canopy, error in the photosynthetic and respiration rates introduced by neglecting the leak rate correction, and errors from assuming that Arabidopsis did not contribute to the photosynthetic CO2 uptake measured in the APH. Another source of error in CQY is introduced from inclusion of the two partial drawdown curves because the photosynthetic rates obtained from those drawdown curves were not measured at the desired 1700 μmol mol–1 CO2 setpoints (Figure 6B). In spite of these shortcomings, the APH CQY measured in microgravity is in general agreement to CQY values obtained in wheat canopies grown on Earth at similar light intensities.Significance of the First Plant Test The first plant test demonstrated the capabilities of the APH facility to conduct fundamental plant research in microgravity onboard the ISS. The hardware validation test verified that all subsystems of the APH were fully operational after it was assembled in the Kibo module. The first plant test demonstrated how two plant species requiring different optimum environmental conditions and with vastly different growth rates can be accommodated in the APH. Although there was minimal crew time for tending the plants, and no provisions for bringing plant samples for further analysis on the ground, the APH was able to measure plant responses to CO2 concentration and to light levels using non-destructive gas exchange techniques. The growth of the plants was accomplished via teleoperated commanding from the EMA at KSC, and the pre-programmed CO2 drawdown experiments were conducted using experiment profiles that controlled the setpoints required for measuring these responses. Admittedly, the gas exchange data collected during the first plant test was not repeated on the ground, thus it cannot be used to make any conclusions regarding plant growth in space. However, this effort demonstrated that the APH has expanded the capabilities of spaceflight plant growth chambers both in the size of the growth area, the higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations possible, as well as in their ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) that can be used to measure plant growth during spaceflight. These capabilities will undoubtedly expand our knowledge of plant growth during spaceflight, which is needed for supporting the sustainable and long-term human colonization of space.Conclusion The APH Facility was installed, assembled and its ability for conducting fundamental plant research on ISS was evaluated and demonstrated. Wheat and Arabidopsis plant canopies were successfully grown from seed and harvested after 6 weeks and after 33 days of growth on ISS, respectively. No pre-flight testing was performed on the ground, thus design team recommended settings were used throughout the operation of the APH during the validation test. The planting, germination, and watering protocols for the two species were demonstrated on ISS. The ability to grow Arabidopsis stems, flowers and siliques was accomplished in 6 weeks and the APH’s ability to contain debris during harvest was demonstrated during harvest of the mature Arabidopsis plants. Environmental and non-destructive plant growth data was collected and used to validate the ability of APH to measure photosynthesis, respiration and CQY of a plant canopy during spaceflight.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.Author Contributions BO, ND, HL, JR, and OM contributed to the conception and design of the study.

    "introduction": "Introduction In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological roles in planta are considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies (1). The entry point into presumed phenoxy radical-radical coupling to the 8–8′ lignan class involves one electron oxidation of the monolignol, e.g. coniferyl alcohol (Fig. 1A, 1), which in the presence of a specific type of dirigent protein (DP; from the Latin dirigere, to guide or to align)2 (3), can undergo distinct forms of stereoselective coupling to afford either the (+)- or the (−)-antipode of pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a or 2b) (1, 3–6). Mechanistically, one electron oxidation (e.g. catalyzed by laccases, peroxidases) is envisaged to generate the corresponding coniferyl alcohol (1)-derived free radical intermediate (CA•), which then binds to the DPs. Bound substrate orientation subsequently occurs in such a way as to enable 8–8′ coupling at the si-si face with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford (+)-pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a), such as in Forsythia intermedia (3), Thuja plicata (4), Schizandra chinensis (5), or pea (Pisum sativum) (7), or alternatively re-re coupling to give the (−)-antipode (Fig. 1A, 2b) as in Arabidopsis (1, 5, 6) and flax (Linum usitatissimum).3 Of these, the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP in pea is annotated as PsDRR206 (9), and the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis thaliana is named AtDIR6 (5). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Pinoresinol-forming dirigent proteins. A, proposed biosynthesis mechanism to afford (+)- or (−)-pinoresinols (2a or 2b) in DP-guided stereoselective couplings with coniferyl alcohol (1) as substrate. B, amino acid sequence alignments of mature (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs with their structural homologue AtAOC2. Secondary structures of PsDRR206 (orange) and AtAOC2 (blue) are also drawn. Loop residues in the PsDRR206 structure absent in the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs are indicated with green dashed lines in the sequences. In this investigation, determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP PsDRR206 is reported. These results are discussed with regard to previously proposed mechanisms for DP-mediated CA• coupling (10) and a published homology model of AtDIR6 (11), as well as existing x-ray structures of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) (12, 13). AOC is a plant enzyme that forms 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, an intermediate in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, from a reactive allene oxide precursor, 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate (14). AOC shares distant sequence similarity to DPs.",

Results: (+)-Pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) three-dimensional structure was obtained at 1.95 Å resolution. Conclusion: The tightly packed trimeric DP has three putative substrate binding sites spatially far apart, suggesting that each site involves monomer coupling directly. Significance: New insights into monolignol radical-radical coupling in planta. Keywords: Crystallography, Homology Modeling, Molecular Docking, Protein Crystallization, Secondary Metabolism, Dirigent Proteins, Phenoxy Radical Radical CouplingAbstract Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.Introduction In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological roles in planta are considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies (1). The entry point into presumed phenoxy radical-radical coupling to the 8–8′ lignan class involves one electron oxidation of the monolignol, e.g. coniferyl alcohol (Fig. 1A, 1), which in the presence of a specific type of dirigent protein (DP; from the Latin dirigere, to guide or to align)2 (3), can undergo distinct forms of stereoselective coupling to afford either the (+)- or the (−)-antipode of pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a or 2b) (1, 3–6). Mechanistically, one electron oxidation (e.g. catalyzed by laccases, peroxidases) is envisaged to generate the corresponding coniferyl alcohol (1)-derived free radical intermediate (CA•), which then binds to the DPs. Bound substrate orientation subsequently occurs in such a way as to enable 8–8′ coupling at the si-si face with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford (+)-pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a), such as in Forsythia intermedia (3), Thuja plicata (4), Schizandra chinensis (5), or pea (Pisum sativum) (7), or alternatively re-re coupling to give the (−)-antipode (Fig. 1A, 2b) as in Arabidopsis (1, 5, 6) and flax (Linum usitatissimum).3 Of these, the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP in pea is annotated as PsDRR206 (9), and the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis thaliana is named AtDIR6 (5). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Pinoresinol-forming dirigent proteins.

Loop residues in the PsDRR206 structure absent in the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs are indicated with green dashed lines in the sequences.In this investigation, determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP PsDRR206 is reported. These results are discussed with regard to previously proposed mechanisms for DP-mediated CA• coupling (10) and a published homology model of AtDIR6 (11), as well as existing x-ray structures of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) (12, 13). AOC is a plant enzyme that forms 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, an intermediate in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, from a reactive allene oxide precursor, 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate (14). AOC shares distant sequence similarity to DPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PsDRR206 The PsDRR206 gene (GenBankTM accession number U11716) was isolated from pea (P. sativum cv. Alcan) genomic DNA using PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 forward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206 reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector construction and transformation were carried out using biolistic bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne et al. (7), as was expression and purification of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture.Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection Initial crystallization conditions for the PsDRR206 protein were obtained using the microbatch under oil method employing 1536-well microassay plate high throughput screening (15) at the Hauptman Woodward Institute (Buffalo, NY). Four conditions from preliminary screening produced microcrystals: condition 265, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m CAPS pH 10, PEG8000 20% (v/v); condition 1006, 0.1 m NH4Br, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, PEG 400 40% (v/v); condition 1077, 5% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.09 m Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 27% PEG 3350; and condition 1474, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, PEG 400 80% (w/v). Initial “hits” were scaled up in-house as hanging drop vapor diffusion methods on VDX 24-well plates (Hampton Research, CA) incubated at 22 °C with a drop size of 3 μl consisting of equal volumes of protein at a concentration of 4–5 mg/ml in 40 mm MES, pH 5, 20 mm Na2SO4, 20% glycerol, and reservoir solution. Each drop was equilibrated against a 500-μl reservoir and monitored periodically. Crystallization conditions were further optimized using grid screening. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained from the final optimized crystallization condition 1077, comprising 4% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.1 m Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 35% PEG 3350. Crystals appeared within 5–10 days and grew to the size of 170 × 170 × 150 μm within 10 weeks. The PsDRR206 crystals were subsequently flash cooled in a cryoprotectant crystallization buffer, stored in cryovials, and shipped to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource for data collection. Native PsDRR206 crystals, diffracting to ∼1.95 Å resolution, belong to the rhombohedral space group H32 (see Table 1). A complete data set comprising 600 images with a rotation angle of 0.2° was collected from a single PsDRR206 crystal on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource Beamline BL12-2 using x-rays at 12,658 eV (0.98093 Å) and a PILATUS 6 m PAD detector running in the shutterless mode. The data were processed with XDS (16) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs (17). The Matthews coefficient (18) assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit was 2.0 Å3/Da (39% solvent content). The final data collection statistics are given in Table 1 (19). TABLE 1.

Data Processing, Structure Determination, and Refinement PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the homology model generated for the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP AtDIR6 from A. thaliana (PM0078038 (11)), which was derived from an x-ray structure of A. thaliana AOC2 (AtAOC2; PDB code 2BRJ (12)). The sequences of PsDRR206 and AtDIR6 were aligned and the AtDIR6 model was converted into a pseudo-DRR206 model using the program CHAINSAW (20) from the CCP4 suite (17). Identical residues in the two sequences were retained, and those that differed were truncated at the Cβ atom. A weak molecular replacement solution, with a weighted R factor of 0.61, and a score of 0.42 was obtained with the program MOLREP (21). This solution was refined for 15 cycles using REFMAC (22) giving crystallographic R factor and Rfree values of 0.48 and 0.54, respectively, and 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps were calculated. Inspection of the electron density showed that the molecular replacement solution was correct, with side chains truncated by CHAINSAW clearly visible in the 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps. Refinement of PsDRR206 structure was completed with the PHENIX suite of programs (23) and manual building of the model using the molecular graphics program COOT (24). Water molecules were added at structurally and chemically relevant positions, and the atomic displacement parameters for all atoms in the structure were refined isotropically. The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for PsDRR206 were deposited to the Protein Data Bank (25) with PDB code 4REV. Superpositions were performed using the SSM procedure (26) as implemented in COOT (24) and the program LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite (17). The figures were generated using PyMOL (27). The surface topography was analyzed with CASTp (28) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Conserved residues were mapped onto the structure using ConSurf (29).Computational Docking Experiments PsDRR206 and two ligands were prepared in AutoDockTools4 (30) with default bonded and nonbonded parameters. One ligand approximated the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA•), with C7 and C8 set to be trivalent, trigonal planar carbon atoms coplanar with the ring carbon and quinone oxygen atoms. A second ligand was the 8–8′ linked bis-quinone methide. Both syn and anti isomers, referring to the relationship between C8 and the methoxyl group, were used in the docking experiments, and rotation about the C7-C8 bond was not allowed in CA•, reflecting its partial double bond character in the resonance hybrid. Flexibility was allowed for the side chains of residues Asp40, Phe79, Tyr101, Ser111, Leu113, Ile161, Thr163, and Leu174. The grid box was centered upon the ligand with sufficient size to cover the ligand, and all flexible residues and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. Autodock Vina (31) was used to perform the docking calculations.Homology Modeling Homology models of AtDIR6 were built in SWISS-MODEL (32).RESULTS Fungally challenged pea (P. sativum) pods have an overall non-host disease response that includes induction of a gene called PsDRR206 (Disease Resistance Response 206), whose protein biochemical function until recently (7) was unknown (33–35). PsDRR206 shares 54% sequence identity with AtDIR6 over the extent of the mature polypeptide. For its study in vitro, recombinant PsDRR206 was constitutively expressed using the strong CaMV 35S promoter of pART17 (5). Large scale (3 liters) suspension culture of transformed tomato (Solanum peruvianum) cells was obtained by gradually increasing the culture volume (starter volume, 40 ml) with fresh liquid medium for 4 weeks at weekly subculturing intervals. Proteins were isolated using a series of strong cationic column chromatographic steps (7) with ∼400 μg of PsDRR206 protein obtained from the 3-liter culture. Detailed biochemical characterization next established it to be a (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (7), and a homologue to our much earlier discovery of this protein type and its physiological function from Forsythia species (3). Thus we have now discovered DPs producing both pinoresinol antipodes, with the recent discovery of a (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis (AtDIR6) (1, 5). Interestingly, the function of AtDIR6 was also reported independently by others (6). Of the various DPs under investigation thus far, however, crystallization conditions have only been identified for PsDRR206, the focus of this investigation. Overall Structure PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.95 Å resolution (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis and connected by a single salt bridge between Glu169 and Arg173. Molecule A comprises residues 28–43, 65–105, 110–135, 138–166, and 169–184, whereas molecule B contains residues 28–42, 66–104, 109–135, 138–166, and 168–184 (see PDB code 4REV for details). Superposition of the two independent molecules gives a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.4 Å for 124 matching Cα atoms. The structure of the PsDRR206 monomer (Fig. 2A) can be best described as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-meander forming a β-barrel. The displacement (shear number) at the suture between β1 and β8, caused by twisting of the β-sheet, is ten residues. The gaps in the structure correspond to the seven N-terminal residues and loops between strands β1–β2, β3–β4, β5–β6a, and β7–β8. In all of these gaps, the electron density was either very weak or missing completely, such that the residues in the loops could not be fitted. Interestingly, the four missing loops are all at one end of the β-barrel, designated here as the top of the molecule (Fig. 2, A and B). N-Linked glycans assumed to be present at Asn50 and Asn120 in PsDRR206 based on their occurrence at the equivalent residues in AtDIR6 (11) are also missing in the electron density map. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Structure of the PsDRR206 monomer. A, ribbon representation of the eight-stranded β-barrel rainbow-colored from the N terminus (blue) to the C terminus (red), showing the secondary structure labeling. B, the PsDRR206 monomer rotated 90° about a vertical axis and colored to show the two component β-sheets in blue (β-sheet 1) and red (β-sheet 2). The location of the domain-swapped strand β2′ from a neighboring PsDRR206 molecule making up the trimer is shown as a transparent gray strand. The two long loops between strands β2/β3 and β6/β7 are colored green.Alternatively, the β-barrel can be viewed as two highly curved anti-parallel sheets formed by strands β2, β3, β4, and β5 (β-sheet 1) and by strands β6, β7, β8, and β1 (β-sheet 2) (Fig. 2B), respectively. Moreover, strand β6 is divided into two shorter strands such that the first part of the strand (β6a) forms the outer strand of β-sheet 2, whereas the C-terminal end (β6b) adds a fifth strand to β-sheet 1. The bifurcation of β6 occurs at a β-bulge at residues Val145-Thr146; a similar bulge is present at the equivalent position in AOC. Analysis of the crystal symmetry shows that PsDRR206 forms a tightly packed trimer, with the trimer axis being orientated along the 3-fold axis of the H32 space group (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, formation of the trimer buries almost 2500 Å2 of surface per monomer and over 30% of the total surface of each monomer. Calculation of the electrostatic surface of the PsDRR206 monomer shows that the outer surface is hydrophilic (left side of Fig. 4A), whereas the inner surface involved in trimer interface formation is predominantly hydrophobic (Fig. 4A, right side, and B). Along with a large number of hydrophobic contacts at the trimer interface, the monomers are also held together by six hydrogen bonding interactions (three for each monomer-monomer pair), and two electrostatic interactions (not shown). Inspection of the trimer shows that the loop between the first two strands is involved in a domain-swapping event (Fig. 3B), wherein the loop does not simply reverse direction and become the second β-strand in the same monomer. Instead, it traverses the interface into the neighboring monomer, such that the N-terminal half of the first strand β2 is inserted into the second monomer next to its strand β2 (Fig. 3, A and B), adding a sixth strand to β-sheet 1. The electron density in this region clearly shows the N-terminal extension of this strand (Fig. 3C). This extension of strand β2 provides an additional nine hydrogen bonds, which include seven main chain interactions with strand β2 from the second monomer and two interactions with side chain atoms from the β2-β3 loop (Fig. 3C). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Structure of the PsDRR206 trimer. A, the trimer viewed down the 3-fold c-axis of the H32 space group. The a- and b-axes are indicated. B, the trimer rotated 90° about the a-axis. One of the extended β2 strands (blue) traverses the trimer interface into neighboring monomer (green), and this region is highlighted by the black oval. C, final 2Fo − Fc electron density, contoured at 1.0 σ, in the vicinity of the domain-swapped β2 strand from the blue monomer. This extended β2 strand makes a typical anti-parallel hydrogen bonding network with the β2 strand from the green monomer, along with interactions with two residues from the omega loop between strands β2 and β3 (Gln93 and Arg96). Some residues in the blue and green β2 strands are indicated.FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Surface representation of PsDRR206. A, the outer (solvent exposed, left panel) and the inner (buried in trimer formation, right panel) electrostatic surfaces of the monomer. The surface potentials range from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue). B, the electrostatic surface of two of the monomers, X and Y, with the third monomer (Z) indicated as a semi-transparent green ribbon. The inner surface of the Z monomer is represented by the right panel in A, rotated 180° about a vertical axis relative to the orientation of the green ribbon. C, the electrostatic surface of one of the monomers orientated to view down into the putative active site. The other two monomers making up the trimer are colored red and blue, and the orientation of the trimer is a 60° rotation about the a-axis relative to A.At the top of each barrel and slightly toward the outside of the trimer is a substantial pocket lined mostly with hydrophobic residues (Figs. 4C and 5, A and B). Several conserved residues cluster around this pocket including strictly conserved charged polar residues Asp40 and Arg141 (Fig. 5A). This narrow pocket is approximately 12 Å deep, 12 Å wide, and 5 Å across. The solvent excluded molecular surface area (Connolly surface) of the pocket is 339 Å2, and its volume is 463 Å3. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Residues lining the interior of the active site pocket. A, several of these residues are conserved, although in only one or the other but not both of the groups of known (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs as indicated in Fig. 1B, suggesting a role in determining substrate orientation. The omega loop is also labeled to indicate proximity to the back side of the active site. B, surface rendering of the active site pocket and surrounding area from the same perspective as A, with residues shown as sticks in A now shown as colored spheres visible under the transparent surface.Adjacent to Asp40 and on the opposite side of the β-sheet is found His39, one of three conserved residues in an unusual cluster of highly conserved residues that also includes Thr84 and Ser91. The latter two residues occur in an omega loop between strands β2 and β3 that folds back upon the exterior of the barrel (Figs. 2B and 5A). An omega loop is a nonregular secondary structure element characterized by a loop of varying structure with its N and C termini located on adjacent secondary structure elements, typically β-strands, close together in space (36).Comparison of PsDRR206 to AOC A Dali search of the PDB (37) identified several β-barrel proteins as being closely related to PsDRR206, including AOC (the first nine hits with Z scores ranging from 12.1 to 11.5), followed by five proteins of unknown function (PDB codes 2Q03, 3G7G, 2OOJ, 3C5O, and 4PUX) with Z scores between 10.5 and 7.8. Unlike AOC, these latter proteins do not form trimeric structures. The Dali search also identified numerous structures from the avidin/streptavidin fold family, but all with Z scores less than 7.0. Like AOC, these are eight-stranded β-barrel proteins with shear number 10; however, they meander in the opposite direction around the barrel. A structure-based sequence alignment of PsDRR206 and the highest scoring Dali hit, Physcomitrella patens AOC (PpAOC2; PDB code 4H69) (13) with bound inhibitor, identified 109 residues within spans of 151 and 164 residues in the PsDRR206 and AOC crystal structures, respectively, that could be aligned with 2.2 Å RMSD for the backbone atoms (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar alignments can also be generated with AtAOC2 structures (12). Most of the aligned residues constitute the common core barrel structure of both proteins, whereas the unaligned portions are in loops linking β-strands. Many of these loops also have substantial insertions and deletions, relative to their counterparts in the other structure. However, the prominent pocket or cleft on each PsDRR206 monomer aligns well with its counterpart in the AOC structure. The shapes of the PsDRR206 and AOC pockets are somewhat similar (Fig. 6A), and their volumes are also quite similar. The size and length of AOC ligands such as vernolic acid (PDB code 2DIO) are comparable with pinoresinol (2). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab PsDRR206 comparison with AOC. A, PsDRR206 (magenta) superposition with P. patens AOC (4H69, chartreuse; with ligand, spheres), with RMSD ∼2.1–2.2 Å over 102 residues. B, aligned (pairwise Dali) residues only, Cα trace, for one monomer. All 102 residues are in the core β-barrel.Computational Docking Studies Because the putative substrate for PsDRR206 is a reactive radical species, experimental investigation of the protein-substrate complex is not straightforward. Accordingly, computational docking studies were conducted using the PsDRR206 x-ray structure and models of both the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA•) and the 8–8′ bis-quinone methide, with the latter being the putative intermediate in pinoresinol (2) formation following (CA•) radical coupling prior to cyclization of the furan rings (Fig. 1A). These docking studies suggest that the binding site can accommodate at least one CA• (Fig. 7A) and that its dimensions are appropriate for the long axis to span the distance from Arg141 to Asp40, with the quinone oxygen and the 9-OH potentially interacting favorably with these charged residues. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Docked models of substrates en route to (+)-pinoresinol (2a), in the putative active site of PsDRR206. A, coniferyl alcohol radical (CA•) in the syn configuration bound such that the re face is exposed, the orientation that would lead to coupling with the re face of another CA• to give the R,R-stereoisomer of 8–8′ bis-quinone methide, the putative initial product from coupling of two coniferyl alcohol radicals as shown in B. In this particular model of the bis-quinone methide, the 3 and 3′-methoxy groups are anti with respect to C8 and C8′; models with syn regiochemistry were also docked. The torsion angle about the 8–8′ bond was restricted to values in which cyclization to form the furan rings of pinoresinol (2) would produce the correct configuration at C7 and C7′. PsDRR206 side chains allowed to be flexible in the docking simulation are labeled and shown as sticks.DISCUSSION The study herein obtained the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) in crystalline form, and at 1.95 Å resolution. In this regard, determination of the PsDRR206 three-dimensional structure, and its analysis suggests that the corresponding trimer has three identical substrate binding sites that are spatially distributed so that intermolecular coupling apparently cannot occur between two distinct substrate binding sites in the trimer model. Furthermore, this trimer observation is in agreement with our earlier studies (3), where the Forsythia DP was considered as a ∼78-kDa trimer based on gel filtration analyses, in contrast to subsequent mass spectrometric data obtained, which had suggested a dimeric protein (38). As indicated above, we also established that PsDRR206 is an eight-stranded β-barrel with the same β-meander topology and remarkably similar trimeric quaternary structure as AOC. Together with the previously mentioned low (∼17% identity), but likely meaningful, sequence similarity between DP and AOC protein families, this suggests a possible common ancestor for these functionally distinct proteins. Although there are striking structural similarities between PsDRR206 and AOC, it remains to be seen whether there are mechanistic similarities as well. Studies of AOC with and without a bound inhibitor suggested that conformational changes in the binding pocket upon formation of a tight enzyme-substrate complex precede the catalytic cycle and that steric restrictions in the active site determine the stereoselectivity of the cyclization reaction (12, 13). Both of these characteristics could be seen to be important in a protein guiding stereoselective phenoxy radical coupling. Conceivably, the trimeric β-barrel DP/AOC scaffold is well suited for these roles. DP Surface Features and Patterns of Conserved Residues We hypothesize that the prominent outward facing pocket near the top of each barrel is the substrate binding (active) site located within the internal cavity of the barrel, based upon comparison with the structures and similar dimensions of P. patens AOC1 and AOC2 with bound substrate analog (PDB codes 4H69 and 4H6B (13)). We further propose that this is the binding site for one or possibly two coniferyl alcohol phenoxy radicals (CA•) in PsDRR206. Conserved residues Thr163 and Phe172 line the edge of the putative binding pocket (Fig. 8, A–D) (29), and disordered loop residues for which electron density is missing occur around the edge of the pocket. Two polar residues, Asp40 and Arg141, conserved in all pinoresinol-forming DPs but not AOCs, are also located at either end of the pocket (Figs. 5A and 7A). The span between them is ∼12–14 Å, suitable for a single trans coniferyl alcohol molecule or quinone methide radical, whose lengths are ∼8–10 Å. Residues in the interior of the pocket are less conserved, however, possibly because they help determine substrate specificity. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab Surface features and conserved residues.

C, view directly into the active site, at ∼45° away from the top view shown in A and B. D, same view as in C, but with residues colored according to ConSurf. The network of conserved residues formed by the omega loop and by residues on the back side of the active site pocket is visible.In PsDRR206, but not AOC, an omega loop consisting of approximately eight residues (Leu85–Lys92) occurs at the bottom of the trimer between β2 and β3 and folds back upon the outside of the barrel (Fig. 5A). A cluster of three highly conserved polar residues (His39, Thr84, and Ser91) also occur (Fig. 8D) where this loop contacts the exterior surface of the barrel. These three residues are conserved in all characterized (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs (Fig. 1B), whereas they are not conserved in AOCs. The cluster adjoins the active site pocket, and indeed His39 neighbors conserved residue Asp40 in the putative active site region, although on the opposite side of the strand in the β-barrel (Fig. 5A). This proximity of conserved residues thus provisionally suggests the omega loop may be the site of an interaction that modulates either substrate orientation or binding in the active site. As indicated above, because the proposed pockets point outwards relative to the trimer axis, a substrate in one pocket is unlikely to be able to couple with those in other pockets elsewhere in the trimer. Another notable residue conserved in DPs, although not in AOCs, is Phe73 (Tyr in FiDIR and some other DPs), which lies near its symmetry mates on the exterior surface of the barrel at its topmost point and near the rim of the putative active site. This positioning suggests it may serve as a hydrophobic anchor point (Figs. 5 and 8 (A and B)). Its conservation and location on the surface suggest it is maintained there by selective pressure. Because they do not appear likely to be necessary for stabilization of the structure, these conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic side chains might instead indicate interaction site(s) for an oxidase, other dirigent proteins, or perhaps even a surface such as that of an actively growing lignin polymer. Several other conserved residues in DPs are also found buried in the trimer interface, supporting the idea that the trimer is the functional form of this and probably other DPs.Comparison of Amino Acid Sequences for DPs with Opposite Stereoselectivities and Homology Models of AtDIR6 In our earlier work (5) and that of others (11), homology models of ScDIR and AtDIR6, (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs, respectively, were made using the very distantly related AOC structures as potential templates. The x-ray structure of PsDRR206, however, now allows construction of accurate homology models of AtDIR6 (∼50% amino acid identity to PsDRR206). Modeling of missing loop residues permits consideration of loop regions surrounding the putative active site where weak or missing electron density prevented fitting of the structure. All of the known (+)-pinoresinol-forming DPs have six more residues in the longest of these loops, between strands β1 and β2 (Leu42 to Gly74 of PsDRR206), than the (−)-pinoresinol DPs. This difference is conserved in various plant species (Fig. 1B). This correlation with stereoselectivity may indicate a role for this loop in binding or orientation of the substrate, for example by acting as a “lid” that closes on the active site as substrates bind. Furthermore, the precise residues essential for distinct stereoselectivities in PsDRR206 and AtDIR6 were of considerable interest, because previously this was only narrowed down to the Region B in the DPs (Fig. 1B) (5). That is, using a region swapping approach, we established regions in the DPs that affected different stereoselectivities resulting in formation of opposite antipodes of pinoresinol (2) (5). Our recent characterization of pea (7) and flax (8) DPs, however, now expands the number of DPs of known function to eleven in seven different plant species, namely F. intermedia, T. plicata, A. thaliana, S. chinensis, Piper regnellii, P. sativum, and L. usitatissimum. Among them, seven DPs (FiDIR, TpDIR5, TpDIR8, ScDIR, PrDIR, PsDRR206, and LuDIR1) afford (+)-pinoresinol (2a), whereas four others (AtDIR5, AtDIR6, LuDIR5, and LuDIR6) generate (−)-pinoresinol (2b). Interestingly, flax has both (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs (LuDIR1 versus LuDIR5 and LuDIR63, respectively). Although previously we had noted 14 residues differentially conserved in (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs (5), the recent identification of pea and flax DPs enabled us to narrow down candidate residues further to six. These now include Gly95, Leu113, Phe115, Phe117, Phe130, and Ile/Leu161 in the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DPs (numbering is based on PsDRR206), as well as Ala98, Phe116, Tyr118, Leu120, Ile133, and Phe164 in the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs; the numbering is based on AtDIR6 (Fig. 1B, with residues marked with green dots). Interestingly, except for Ile161 of PsDRR206 (and Phe164 in the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP), all of these residues are located in Region-B (Lys90–Leu138 of AtDIR6) that was previously found responsible for altered stereoselectivity by region swapping (5). Furthermore, residues Leu113 and Phe115 of PsDRR206 (Phe116 and Tyr118 of AtDIR6) are located within the putative active site region (Fig. 5, A and B), with both residues being on the β4 strand and having their side chains positioned at distances less than 10 Å to the conserved polar residues Asp40 and Arg141; the latter provisionally appears to be positioned in a way that could determine whether the si or re face of bound CA• is exposed and available for coupling. Accordingly, in the future, site-directed mutagenesis will examine whether one or more of the six residues determine distinct stereoselectivities.Homology Modeling of the Putative Active Site in (−)-Pinoresinol-forming AtDIR6 The backbone RMSD between PsDRR206 and the published AtDIR6 homology model of Pickel et al. (11) is ∼5 Å, varying depending on which residues are superimposed. Three β-strands are out of register by two residues each with respect to their counterparts in the experimentally determined x-ray structure. Although the same side chains occupy the core of the β-barrel, they are misplaced because of incorrect alignment of neighboring strands. Our own models (5) were similarly poor. Such results are not unexpected given the low sequence similarity (∼17% identity in the core β-barrel) between AtDIR6 and AtAOC2, the template used to generate the homology model. Nonetheless, the model of Pickel et al. (11) was sufficient to obtain a molecular replacement solution for the PsDRR206 crystal structure. This is because the core β-barrel of the template, AtAOC2 (PDB code 2BRJ) aligns very well with that of PsDRR206 (RMSD 3.2 Å over 113 residues). The structure has a RMSD 2.2 Å with P. patens AOC (PpAOC2, PDB code 4H69; Fig. 6B, which itself has a 1 Å RMSD alignment with AtAOC2). More specifically, because side chain atoms are not typically used in finding structure solutions by molecular replacement, the misalignment of several β-strands did not matter in this instance so long as positions of backbone atoms in the barrel are not perturbed by the misalignment. Using the PsDRR206 x-ray structure as a template, a new homology model of AtDIR6 was thus constructed to investigate the basis for differing stereoselectivities in pinoresinol-forming DPs. (Fig. 9). Five of the six residues that are differentially conserved among (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs from a range of plant species cluster together in the deep interior of the putative active site pocket. A seventh active site residue (Val176 in PsDRR206), not included in the original set because it is substituted with Thr in one (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, becomes Met in (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs. These residues are located opposite each another on either side of the pocket, in the center of one or the other of the two highly curved antiparallel β-sheets that form the β-barrel. Other active site residues nearer the mouth of the pocket are strictly conserved, such as Asp40, Arg141, and Thr163. We propose that the two different sets of differentially conserved residues force CA• to bind such that only the si (for (+)-pinoresinol (2a)) or the re (for (−)-pinoresinol (2b)) face is exposed and available to couple with a second CA• (or possibly CA), which itself must be oriented properly, perhaps by residues in the β1-β2 loop. Uncovering specific details of the mechanism, such as the actual roles of Asp40 and Arg141 and the orientation of each substrate, will likely require structural characterization of DPs with substrate or product analogues. Missing residues in loops surrounding the putative active site at the top of the β-barrel were also modeled to establish the range through which their motion can occur assuming the core barrel structure remains intact (Fig. 10). In particular, the 23 missing residues in the β1-β2 loop span a distance of ∼32 Å, conceivably providing ample potential to adopt a range of conformations. FIGURE 9.

Differentially conserved active site side chains from (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs are shown and labeled in terms of the PsDRR206 residue type and number then the equivalent AtDIR6 residue type. (Valine 176 is substituted with threonine in the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP ScDIR (5).)FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab PsDRR206 structure with residues in missing loops built in as disordered polypeptide chains (black) and subjected to backbone torsion minimization. Putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn50 and Asn120) are indicated with red asterisks.Mechanistic Considerations The trimeric DP structure shows that each active site is isolated from the others and will not allow two substrates bound at two different active sites to interact. In light of this finding, the most likely mechanism is that a single active site binds two substrates that combine to form product. The putative PsDRR206 binding pocket would thus bind two CA• in an orientation allowing si-si coupling to form the (+)-pinoresinol antipode (2a), whereas the homologue AtDIR6 would afford the corresponding (−)-enantiomer (2b) through re-re coupling. However, a variation in which one CA• and one coniferyl alcohol (1) bind and react cannot be ruled out. Docking studies (Fig. 7) suggested that two CA• substrates could bind in the active site, as could an 8–8′ bis-quinone methide (Fig. 1A). Although two positions of the methoxy group (syn or anti) with respect to C8 are possible in the quinone methide, discrimination of si and re faces that determine the stereochemistry at C8/8′ in pinoresinol (2) does not require the methoxy group to be in one position or the other. After the bis-quinone methide is formed, each of the 9/9′ -OH groups could nucleophilically attack the C7/C7′ quinone methide moieties to form the pinoresinol furanofuran product. Both cyclizations apparently occur stereospecifically, with no rotation about C7-C8, because this would instead lead to 7-epi-pinoresinol (or bis 7-epi-pinoresinol if a 180° rotation about both C7-C8 bonds occurred). This suggests that the bis-quinone methide intermediate is not released from the active site and that both substrates are bound such that both 8–8′ coupling and C7-O9′ and C7′-O9 ring closure occur in the bound state. Pinoresinol (2) formation probably concludes with protonation of the quinone oxygen after rearomatization to form a phenol. Residue Asp40 in the putative binding pocket could be the source of this proton. Alternatively, if CA• is bound in the opposite lengthwise orientation, the positively charged side chain of Arg141 could stabilize the quinone form of the phenolic oxygen in CA•, helping to localize the radical at C8 and favor coupling there. Indeed, binding in either orientation potentially provides ample opportunity for π-stacking interactions with aromatic residues in the active site (Fig. 7B). Asp40 and Arg141 are conserved in all DPs, whereas AOC does not have the corresponding residues, suggesting that they are required for substrate binding and activity specific to DPs, rather than for structural stability. The 2-fold rotational symmetry of the pinoresinol molecule may have helped shape previous hypotheses (10, 11) for the mechanism of its formation involving a DP dimer with a single CA• substrate bound to each monomer. The structure presented here is not consistent with such a mechanism, without invocation of a substrate-induced head to head joining of two trimers, for which there is currently no evidence. Interestingly, in addition to stereoselective control over monolignol coupling in lignan biosynthesis, another study has also reported DP domain involvement in lignification in the root Casparian strip (39). Although this is in conceptual agreement with our earlier considerations of DPs and proteins harboring dirigent (substrate binding) sites/domains for lignan biosynthesis and lignification (8, 40), respectively, it must be emphasized that most DPs still await discovery of their true physiological functions, as well as in terms of chemical structural and in vitro function analyses. In due course, we will obtain definitive mechanistic models for substrate binding, orientation, coupling, intramolecular cyclization, and product release.Acknowledgments We thank Marlisa Burton, Terri Lincoln, Mia Ryckman, and Paul Ziegler for assistance in DP purification.

Copyright notice ID: 5933128 PMID: 29523714 Modulation of arogenate dehydratase in Arabidopsis causes changes in secondary metabolism, transient overaccumulation of starch, and lower photosynthetic electron transport rates.Abstract Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in ADT mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement. Arogenate dehydratases (ADTs) catalyze the dehydrative decarboxylation of arogenate to Phe (Jung et al., 1986; Siehl and Conn, 1988; Cho et al., 2007) in the stroma of chloroplasts and plastids in vascular plants (Rippert et al., 2009). In terms of carbon allocation from photosynthesis, only a very small fraction of this Phe resides in proteins. Phe downstream metabolism is instead targeted largely toward generating substrates/precursors of lignin biopolymers and an enormous array of compounds that are predominantly phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid acetate metabolites, such as flavonoids (Supplemental Fig. S1; Corea et al., 2012). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has a six-member ADT gene family. However, it is not well understood (1) to what extent specific ADT genes are differentially regulated as to carbon allocation into distinct downstream metabolic branches and/or (2) what effect differential gene expression might have on metabolism overall, including upstream effects on photosynthesis capacity and source/sink relationships. As shown previously, knockout mutants of the Arabidopsis ADT gene family were associated with different degrees of reduction of lignin content (Corea et al., 2012). These plant lines were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of light) from germination to maturation (8–10 weeks), which induced stem elongation (bolting) and lignification. From the eight knockout lines generated, single knockouts of ADT1 and ADT3 had no apparent impact on bolting stem lignin content, whereas the ADT4 knockout resulted in a slightly higher lignin stem content and the ADT5 knockout had decreased lignin stem content by ∼18%. The adt4/5 line displayed a further reduction in lignin content of ∼38%, as did the triple knockouts adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5, which displayed ∼50% reductions. The quadruple knockout adt3/4/5/6 possessed the greatest magnitude of lignin reduction of ∼70% and was unable to maintain bolting stem structural integrity. The double mutant adt4/5 and the triple mutants adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 also displayed some visual evidence of bolting stem structural weakening. Due to this important role in cell wall lignin biosynthesis, ADT is a potentially attractive target for metabolic engineering of lignin contents in plants (Corea et al., 2012). However, remodeling of plant metabolism by genetic tools has to take into account the fact that biochemical reactions in the cell are interconnected, meaning that the manipulation of one specific pathway can potentially have several systemic consequences. Understanding such interdependencies is essential for metabolic engineering approaches to, for example, improve traits of interests in crop plants and forestry species. To explore the consequences of ADT modulation, the effects on the reactions biochemically upstream of photosynthetic energy conversion and overall metabolism were examined in ADT mutants. Here, we describe a high-throughput phenotyping system (phenomics; Puthiyaveetil et al., 2014; Tietz et al., 2015) that allowed us to monitor changes in photosynthetic performance and growth over almost the entire vegetative growth period of Arabidopsis wild-type and ADT knockout mutant plants. For photosynthesis, this high-throughput approach was based on non-invasive optical determination of key photosynthetic parameters derived from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (Kramer et al., 2004; Baker, 2008; Brooks and Niyogi, 2011). Metabolomics analyses performed following photosynthetic parameter assessments (i.e. plants analyzed 44 days after sowing [DAS]), as well as later (70 DAS), focused on both targeted and non-targeted (polar) secondary metabolites using hyphenated liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry approaches. Real-time atmospheric monitoring-mass spectrometry (RTAM-MS) also was employed to evaluate net CO2 uptake rates. The significance of our findings is described below. RESULTS Selection of Growth Conditions Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant; its flowering is delayed under short-day conditions (Haughn et al., 1995; Koornneef et al., 1998). In our previous studies, ADT knockout mutants (adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6) and wild-type plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of light and 8 h of dark), with lignifying stems beginning to bolt by about 3 weeks (Corea et al., 2012). For the photosynthetic studies described herein, plants were grown under short-day conditions (9 h of light), which are typically employed in Arabidopsis photosynthetic studies. That is, plants did not form inflorescence stems (Fig. 1A) within the study time frame, as this developmental stage is delayed under short-day conditions. The overall purpose here was to simultaneously study, in our phenomics facility, the effect of altered ADT activity on photosynthetic efficiency, plant growth parameters, and secondary metabolism. Photosynthetic and growth parameters were thus measured every 2 d. These measurements were complemented by the determination of starch content and other metabolomics analyses as well as the analysis of net CO2 uptake of plants at the completion of the phenomics analyses that were still in the vegetative growth phase.

Photographs at right are examples of the different growth phases (indicated by blue arrows). Bar = 2 cm.Establishing Phenomics Capability Large-scale phenotyping of plants is an important emerging field in plant biology and agricultural research (Tester and Langridge, 2010; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Fahlgren et al., 2015). However, it is a challenge to ensure uniform environmental conditions over the entire growth facility, as small heterogeneities in microclimates often occur that lead to artificial differences in plant physiological responses. To minimize such potential differences, a block approach was applied that consisted of one wild-type and eight ADT mutant plants per block (Fig. 1A). In this way, data gained from the mutants can be normalized to the corresponding wild-type plant in the same block. Since the block size is small (26 × 26 cm), microclimate differences can be considered to have a negligible effect. Starting with the block arrangement, the entire phenomics facility was filled as shown in Figure 1B, thereby permitting each genotype to be measured in 12-fold replicates. To further enhance the statistical significance of comparisons between ADT mutants and the wild type, four independent sets of measurements were performed (Fig. 1C), creating 40 biological replicates per genotype. Furthermore, for the automated determination of physiological parameters from chlorophyll fluorescence data, areas belonging to the plant were separated from non-plant areas. This was readily achieved by thresholding chlorophyll fluorescence values (i.e. when the fluorescence intensity of a pixel is above a certain level, it counts as part of the plant). Accordingly, plant and nonplant areas can be separated seamlessly (Fig. 1D). An advantage of noninvasive optical screening is that plants can be observed over long time periods without perturbing growth/development. Wild-type and ADT mutant plants were thus screened for over 4 weeks in the phenomics facility starting from 20 DAS (Fig. 1F), with plant size estimated as total pixel size that represents the projection of all plant leaves during the vegetative growth period studied (Fig. 1D). The growth curves of the four individual sets of plants (Fig. 1E) displayed quite high congruence that justified averaging the four sets (Fig. 1F). Additionally, the 4-week growth measurement in the phenomics facility (Fig. 1, E and F) covers almost the entire vegetative life span from young seedlings to mature plants, but prior to the onset of inflorescence stem growth. Since the photosynthetic phenotypes were most pronounced in the adt3/4/5/6 quadruple knockout relative to the wild type (Fig. 2A), we concentrated on functional analysis of this mutant for additional insights into effects on the photosynthetic apparatus. This is detailed in the next section. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Comparison of growth characteristics and photosynthetic parameters in wild-type (WT) and adt3/4/5/6 plants.

Data are means ± se calculated from the four measuring sets. C and D, qE (C) and 1-qL (D). Data are derived as in A. For details, see text. In B to D, histograms at right depict means ± se averaged over the entire measuring period, with significant differences indicated by red stars (Student’s t test; one star, P < 0.05; three stars, P < 0.001).Phenomics Analysis with the adt3/4/5/6 Mutant The consequences of impaired carbon flux into lignin and potentially other phenylpropanoid metabolites with regard to photosynthetic primary reactions are unknown. To address this, a comparison between adt3/4/5/6 and wild-type plants was performed, with total leaf areas plotted in Figure 2A. For young seedlings (20–30 DAS) and older plants (40–50 DAS) prior to inflorescence stem development, no significant differences in leaf growth were apparent between both lines. However, at midgrowth phase (30–40 DAS), where plants show the most rapid increase in biomass, adt3/4/5/6 plants displayed a somewhat diminished growth relative to wild-type plants (Fig. 2A, with statistically significant differences marked by red stars). To further study the impact of ADT modulation on photosynthesis, a chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was conducted in parallel to the growth measurements. In this regard, the ΦII parameter measures the photochemical energy conversion efficiency of PSII and is a measure of linear photosynthetic electron flux (Genty et al., 1989; Kramer et al., 2004; Baker, 2008). ΦII is determined by two parameters: photoprotective high-energy quenching (qE) and the fraction of PSII reaction centers that are open (qL; Kramer et al., 2004; Baker, 2008). The latter is a measure of electron backpressure in the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain (expressed as the fraction of closed centers: 1-qL) and depends on the efficiency of NADPH + H+ consumption by downstream metabolic reactions (mainly the Calvin-Benson cycle). Over the measurement period, ΦII fluctuated randomly by about ±10% without a time-dependent trend (Fig. 2B), although ΦII tended to be slightly smaller for the adt3/4/5/6 line. This became statistically significant when ΦII was averaged over the entire measuring period (Fig. 2B, right). When these measurements were performed with plants at the end of the night period (night-adapted [NA] plants), essentially the same effect for ΦII was obtained for day-adapted (DA) plants (measured around noon), as shown in the histogram at right in Figure 2B. The qE mechanism is induced by acidification of the thylakoid lumen that is caused by light-induced proton pumping of PSII and the cytochrome b6f complex (Ruban et al., 2012). As for ΦII, both qE and 1-qL fluctuated randomly over the measurement period (Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, they were averaged over the entire time frame to identify significant changes (Fig. 2, C and D, right). Comparison of both parameters revealed that the reason for the lower ΦII in adt3/4/5/6 was an increased qE but not a change in redox status of the PET chain (no change in 1-qL). The higher qE in the mutant line is indicative of a higher ΔpH across thylakoid membranes. These data provisionally suggested that ATP, generated from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) during photosynthesis, was less efficiently consumed by energy-dependent metabolic processes in adt3/4/5/6 (i.e. ΔpH increased because substrates for the ΔpH-consuming ATPase [ADP + Pi] became limiting due to inefficient consumption of ATP). Impairment in metabolizing ATP in adt3/4/5/6 would be in accordance with the observed overaccumulation of starch in the DA samples acting as an ATP sink in adt3/4/5/6 plants (Fig. 3A). This was supported further by measurements of ATP/ADP ratios (see “Materials and Methods”). For both the DA and NA light conditions, the ATP/ADP ratios for adt3/4/5/6 were higher compared with those in the wild type (0.77 and 0.6 for adt3/4/5/6 versus 0.62 and 0.52 for the wild type, respectively), which suggested restricted ATP consumption in adt3/4/5/6.

Data are means ± se, collected for DA and NA plants. nd, Not detected.PET and Electrochromic Shift Measurements To characterize photosynthetic energy conversion in more detail, light saturation curves were recorded under laboratory conditions (Fig. 4). The measurements utilized NA leaves adapted to different light intensities with the dark-interval-relaxation kinetics (DIRK) method (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). The determination of qE requires a dark period after illumination that is impractical for measuring a light saturation curve (constant changes of light intensities). Therefore, the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) parameter was measured instead, this being dominated by the qE component (Baker, 2008). NPQ can be used as a proxy for qE (herein, for the sake of simplicity, the term NPQ will be used also if qE is measured). As expected, increasing light intensity led to reduction in ΦII (Fig. 4A) because of electron backpressure from the Calvin-Benson cycle (saturation of biochemical pathways) and down-regulation of PSII activity by NPQ. The ΦII values for the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 at 200 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 were between 0.35 and 0.4, which is in good agreement with the data collected for NA plants in the phenomics facility (∼0.32) for the same light intensity (Fig. 2B). Activation of NPQ with increasing light intensity was clearly observed (Fig. 4B). Comparing the wild type with adt3/4/5/6 showed a small decrease in ΦII (5%–10%) and a small increase in NPQ (5%–15%), mainly at moderate light intensities (120–300 μmol quanta m–2 s–1; i.e. approximately the light intensity of the 200 μmol quanta m–2 s−1 used in the phenomics facility). Plotting ΦII as a function of NPQ showed an almost linear correlation with no significant differences observed between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 (Fig. 4C). This high congruence gave strong evidence that the sensitivity of linear electron transport flux on the NPQ mechanism was unchanged in adt3/4/5/6. Figure 4.

B, NPQ. C, Linear correlation between ΦII and NPQ. Data are means ± se, with significant differences indicated by red stars (Student’s t test, P < 0.05).To understand why NPQ was higher in adt3/4/5/6, the proton motive force (PMF) across the thylakoid membrane was measured by employing electrochromic shift (ECS) measurements on intact leaves. The ECS measurement is a noninvasive optical absorption method that quantifies the magnitude of the light-generated PMF in thylakoid membranes (Bailleul et al., 2010), with an apparent peak absorption at 520 nm (Witt, 1979; Bailleul et al., 2010). For relative fast absorption measurements (faster than 1 s), the A520 is almost free of other signal components that could interfere. It was next measured in the DIRK measuring mode on NA plants. Typical measurements for different light intensities (ranging from 70 to 850 μmol quanta m–2 s–1) are shown in Figure 5A. The actual ECS signal for a given light intensity (ECS total) is given as the difference of absorption level in the light minus the level in the subsequent dark pulse (see the arrow in Fig. 5A, for 850 µmol quanta m–2 s–1). Figure 5B shows a statistical analysis of ECS amplitude as a function of light intensity. Increasing the latter led to higher ECS, because the rate of light-induced proton pumping by PSII and the cytochrome b6f complex increased. The ECS was saturated at around 400 μmol quanta m–2 s–1. Importantly, the ECS was higher in adt3/4/5/6 compared with wild-type leaves. Thus, the higher light-generated PMF in adt3/4/5/6 was most likely the reason for its elevated NPQ (Figs. 2C and 4B). The higher PMF in adt3/4/5/6 agrees with data described above that indicate restricted ATP consumption. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Energization of thylakoid membranes measured by ECS.

WT, Wild type.Metabolomics of the Wild Type and ADT Mutants Two sets of metabolomics analyses of the rosette leaves were carried out. The first set corresponded with the completion of the photosynthetic (phenomics) study at 44 DAS, whereas the second was at 70 DAS, when all plant lines were still in vegetative growth (i.e. they were not senescing).Metabolic Analysis of Rosette Leaves (70 DAS) Nine plants for all of the different lines were harvested for both DA and NA treatments 70 DAS. This was partly in order to establish whether, under short-day conditions, the different ADT knockout mutants displayed similar trends in terms of modulating (reducing) levels of soluble low-Mr phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid acetate metabolites, as noted previously for lignins when grown under long-day conditions (Corea et al., 2012). In addition, analyses of both DA and NA plant lines were aimed at determining specific changes that could potentially be affected by the circadian rhythm. Non-targeted metabolomics analyses were first conducted. Using freely available computational tools (XCMS, CAMERA, DeviumWeb, and MeV; see “Materials and Methods”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (UPLC-qTOF)-electrospray ionization chromatograms were processed for retention time correction and integration, resulting in ∼540 detected features (i.e. unique m/z versus retention time signals). Initially, we focused on comparing wild-type plants with adt3/4/5/6 plants, the latter being hypothesized to display the most dramatic effects on metabolism given the phenotype observed. In this comparison, we identified 304 and 250 features that were altered significantly (P ≤ 0.05, after normalization to the internal standard naringenin recoveries) following comparison of DA and NA plants, respectively. Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the features detected with corresponding statistical analysis for all individual features. An initial global assessment of the metabolomics data also was performed using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA), after peak intensities were normalized to internal standard naringenin recoveries, centered, and standardized. This initial analysis was used for rapid visualization of overall metabolic effects and trends across the different ADT mutants and time of harvest (i.e. DA and NA plants) as well as for the selection of those metabolites most significantly affected by ADT modulation, thereby helping guide subsequent annotation efforts. It was next instructive to establish (to the extent possible) the identities of significantly altered features. Accordingly, our experimental approach focused on the known polar secondary metabolites found in Arabidopsis. These included flavonoids, phenylpropanoids (i.e. sinapoyl esters and lignans), benzenoids, and glucosinolates (D’Auria and Gershenzon, 2005; Nakabayashi et al., 2009), as detected in chromatograms of leaf extracts (Supplemental Fig. S2). In this regard, compounds were identified either through the use of authentic standards or were annotated based on comparisons with the literature and/or public spectral libraries of known Arabidopsis metabolites (D’Auria and Gershenzon, 2005; Glauser et al., 2008; Nakabayashi et al., 2009; Matsuda et al., 2010). In addition, a third group of features was provisionally annotated in terms of putative chemical class (Sumner et al., 2007), but their structures were not unambiguously determined (Supplemental Table S1). In the wild type, six flavonoids, some of the most characteristic and abundant metabolites in Arabidopsis (Veit and Pauli, 1999; Saito et al., 2013), were detected.

(2007): 1, identified compounds with authentic standards; 2, compounds with putative annotations based on spectral similarity with spectral libraries; and 3, compound classes with putative annotations (i.e. compounds not fully characterized/identified). Empty cells indicate where metabolites were not detected under these conditions. Another abundant metabolite class in Arabidopsis extracts was the glucosinolates (Brown et al., 2003). These included the known Phe-derived gluconasturtiin (2-phenethylglucosinolate), three indole-derived glucosinolates (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, 1-methoxyglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin), and seven aliphatic glucosinolates (glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucoalyssin, glucohesperalin, glucoibarin, glucohirsutin, and hexyl glucosinolate or 4-methylpentyl glucosinolate; Supplemental Fig. S3B; Table I). The extracts also contained several other known phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites, corresponding to monomeric or dimeric (lignan) phenylpropanoid metabolites (D’Auria and Gershenzon, 2005; Seneviratne et al., 2015). The former included three known malate-containing compounds (5-hydroxyferuloyl malate, sinapic acid malate ester, and sinapoyl malate) as well as three glycosides (coniferin, 1,2-di-O-sinapoyl-β-d-Glc, and sinapic acid glucoside; Supplemental Fig. S3C). The dimeric phenylpropanoids (lignans) included two known pinoresinol derivatives (pinoresinol-4,4ʹ-di-O-β-d-glucoside and pinoresinol-4-O-β-d-glucoside; Supplemental Fig. S3D; Seneviratne et al., 2015); however, there were four other putative lignans detected (Table I; Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). These were generically annotated as lignan glucosides (Table I), but with no precise structure being determined due to the lack of sufficient material for unambiguous structure determination. Three putative galactolipids also were detected. These were annotated previously in Arabidopsis (Glauser et al., 2008), based on comparison of high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra, as sn1-O-(12-oxophytodienoyl)-monogalactosyl monoglyceride, sn1-O-(12-oxophytodienoyl)-digalactosyl monoglyceride, and sn2-O-(di-nor-oxophytodienoyl)-monogalactosyl monoglyceride (Supplemental Fig. S3E; Table I). Finally, three putative phenolic glucosides were detected, including one hydroxybenzoic acid glucopyranoside and two isomers of dihydroxybenzoic acid-O-pentoside (Table I). Quadruple, Triple, and Double ADT Knockouts Statistical comparison of individual metabolite levels in adt3/4/5/6, the most greatly affected mutant line, versus the wild type can be found in Table I. For the flavonoids mentioned above, significant changes in levels were observed in adt3/4/5/6, with reductions of ∼40% and ∼30% in NA and DA plants compared with wild-type plants. Compared with levels in the wild type, the adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 triple knockouts also had very similar flavonoid reductions of ∼40% and ∼26% in NA and DA plants, whereas the double knockout adt4/5 had smaller flavonoid reductions of ∼17% (Fig. 6A). By comparison, under these growth conditions, the flavonoid reduction levels in adt3/4/5/6 were just over half of those observed for long-day-grown plant lines. Figure 6.

All values are relative to the internal standard naringenin. *, 0.01 < P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01.Monomeric phenylpropanoid and lignan contents followed somewhat comparable trends, with multiple ADT knockouts having the most pronounced effects (Fig. 6, B and C, respectively). For the monomeric phenylpropanoids, their amounts in triple and quadruple knockouts were reduced by ∼25% and ∼20% in NA and DA plants, respectively, relative to that in the wild type. A slightly lesser effect (i.e. a reduction of ∼12%) was observed in adt4/5. Lignans displayed a similar pattern, with highest reductions in triple and quadruple knockout lines, reaching reductions of ∼64% to 68% and ∼58% to 67% in NA and DA plants, respectively. In adt4/5, slightly lower reductions of ∼58% were observed for NA plants and 55% for DA plants. Significant differences were observed in levels of other metabolite classes not derived directly from Phe. Putative phenolic glucoside levels were reduced significantly (Fig. 6D), reaching reductions of ∼31% and ∼44% for NA and DA adt3/4/5/6 plants, respectively, relative to that in the wild type. In addition, the triple knockout adt1/4/5 had reductions of ∼21% and ∼40% for NA and DA plants, respectively, whereas adt3/4/5 displayed reductions of ∼35% for both NA and DA plants. The double knockout adt4/5 had a somewhat smaller reduction in phenolic glucosides of ∼28%. Another striking observation was with the levels of the 11 glucosinolates that were detected at significantly lower levels in ADT knockouts relative to the wild type (Fig. 6, E and F). Of these, the reduction in levels of gluconasturtiin (Fig. 6F) could be anticipated, since it is partly derived from Phe (Underhill, 1968). Indeed, its levels were very much affected, reaching reductions of ∼77% in both NA and DA adt3/4/5/6 plants. The triple knockout adt3/4/5 also had ∼77% and ∼58% reductions in NA and DA plants, respectively, whereas adt1/4/5 had ∼65% and ∼70% reductions, relative to the wild type. The double knockout adt4/5 additionally displayed some levels of reduction, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, with reductions of ∼54% and ∼60% in NA and DA plants, respectively. Although less pronounced, significant overall reductions in the levels of all other glucosinolates also were detected (Fig. 6E), with ∼39% and ∼42% reductions in adt3/4/5/6 NA and DA plants and ∼36%/∼31%, and ∼27%/∼16% reductions in adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 NA and DA plants, respectively. The double mutant adt4/5 displayed a reduction of ∼37% in total glucosinolate in DA plants, but no significant reduction (∼6%) was observed in NA plants (Fig. 6E). We also detected several metabolites with significantly higher levels in ADT-deficient plant lines. Of these, we annotated three putative galactolipids that were presumed to be abundant in the thylakoid membrane and that could be related to altered photosynthetic parameters (Kobayashi et al., 2013). The relative amounts of these compounds displayed a clear circadian rhythm pattern (i.e. barely detectable in DA plants versus significantly higher contents in NA plants; Fig. 6G). Besides that, their contents in NA plants also were affected significantly by changes in ADT, with levels increasing further from single to multiple knockouts. Of these, the most markedly altered were those in adt3/4/5/6 plants, where the amounts detected were approximately double the content observed in wild-type plants.Single Knockouts While multiple knockout lines had the most dramatic effects in reductions in levels of most metabolites detected, the single knockouts had differing effects for different metabolite classes. For combined total flavonoid levels (also for each individually), adt1 had the most pronounced reductions in comparison with the wild type (∼30% change [P = 0.016] and ∼20% [P = 0.006] in NA and DA plants, respectively) of the various single knockout lines (Fig. 6A; Supplemental Table S1). Monomeric phenylpropanoid levels followed the same trend somewhat, with the adt1 line also having highest reductions in comparison with the wild type (∼30% [P = 0.003] and ∼10% [P = 0.02] in NA and DA plants, respectively; Fig. 6B; Supplemental Table S1). Lignan content, however, was not affected significantly in any single knockout line in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 6C; Supplemental Table S1). In contrast, phenolic glucoside levels in single knockouts were reduced more significantly in adt4 and adt5 plants in comparison with wild-type plants, with ∼35% (P = 0.01) and 25% (P = 0.02) reductions, respectively, in NA plants and ∼28% (P = 0.05 for adt4 plants and P = 0.03 for adt5 plants) reductions in DA plants (Fig. 6D; Supplemental Table S1). While in the adt1 plants, no significant differences were observed in phenolic glucoside contents in NA plants, the DA plants had a significant (P = 0.014) level of reduction (∼40%). On the other hand, adt3 plant lines were not significantly different from the wild type. Glucosinolate levels in NA plants were mainly significantly different in the comparison of adt4 and adt5 with wild-type lines, with reductions of ∼36% (P = 0.0001) and 26% (P = 0.02), whereas the corresponding DA plants had greater reductions of ∼52% (P = 0.01) and ∼47% (P = 0.03), respectively (Fig. 6E; Supplemental Table S1). Finally, for putative galactolipid levels, the adt4 line potentially had the second highest increase among all lines relative to wild-type levels (∼60%), although this was not statistically significant due to the variability observed (P = 0.115; Fig. 6G; Supplemental Table S1). A group of molecules with masses consistent with molecular structures having 19 carbon atoms and eight oxygen atoms also were detected at higher levels in ADT knockouts relative to the wild type. We provisionally postulate that they belong to the apocarotenoid metabolite class (Matsunami et al., 2009) and perhaps may have a direct relationship with the photosynthetic effects observed (i.e. given carotenoid roles in light harvesting and photoprotection, as hormones and growth regulators, and in other environmental interactions; Ruiz-Sola and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2012). The unequivocal annotation of these compounds requires a complete structural characterization that was not possible here due to their low abundance.Metabolic Analysis of Rosette Leaves (44 DAS) The analysis of leaves of DA wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants, harvested 44 DAS, showed comparable trends to those at 70 DAS. When compared with DA wild-type plants, DA adt3/4/5/6 plants at 44 DAS showed significant (P < 0.01) decreases in levels of the lignan glucosides M565T765, M521T765, and M519T836 (for compound names, see Table I) by ∼34%, 63%, and 57%, respectively; the corresponding DA plants at 70 DAS had ∼58 to ∼67% reductions. We also detected reduced levels of the monomeric phenylpropanoids M385T589, M339T796, and M339T808 by ∼40%, 24%, and 18%, respectively, but the first with P < 0.05 only; DA plants at 70 DAS had ∼20% reductions. Flavonoids were decreased slightly in amounts: M739T610 and M593T713 by ∼7% and ∼17%, respectively, compared with ∼30% in DA plants at 70 DAS. As before, we observed increases in the levels of putative galactolipids (M545T1236, M735T1343, and M573T1455 by ∼25%, 24%, and 13%, respectively), which correspond favorably to those in DA plants at 70 DAS.RTAM-MS of CO2 From our starch measurements, we discovered that starch accumulation in adt3/4/5/6 was higher in DA plants than in the wild type (Fig. 3A), and this was inversely correlated to linear electron flux (Fig. 7). Thus, we further investigated whether there was also a significant difference in respiration rate of net carbon fixation in relation to the different starch levels observed. To do this, we measured CO2 absorption and release rates in adt3/4/5/6 and wild-type plants with large starch reserves (DA) or in plants depleted of starch (NA). A real-time atmospheric mass spectrometer was used to measure CO2 levels of wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants under both DA and NA conditions. The DA and NA plants were then subjected to a period of dark or light in order to observe whether there was a differential rate of respiration or carbon fixation between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Relationship between starch content and ΦII in wild-type (WT) and ADT mutant plants. A, Starch content (red outlined bars, right axis) and ΦII (gray bars) of the various genotypes. The red horizontal line indicates wild-type values for comparison. B, Linear correlation between starch content and ΦII. All data are means ± se.Figure 8 shows the median CO2 levels fixed by wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants under NA and DA conditions. For NA plants, the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, when exposed initially to light, presumably begin to fix CO2, but this initial rate of CO2 uptake appears to not yet be at a level to offset night time respiration rates. These measurements occurred 50 min after the light change, and all photosynthetic and respiration machinery may not be fully switched over yet between light and dark conditions, which could explain the negative CO2 uptake. Whereas adt3/4/5/6 plants seemed to have a higher CO2 uptake rate than wild-type plants at the time point measured, a Student’s t test performed between the two groups of measurements indicated no significant difference (P = 0.20). In plants that have high levels of accumulated starch (DA conditions) and that are subjected to the dark when respiration pathways would dominate, there appeared to be a higher rate of respiration in adt3/4/5/6 compared with the wild type, but this increased rate also was not statistically significant. Figure 8. Open in a new tab CO2 levels in wild-type (WT) and adt3/4/5/6 plants following the depletion (NA) or accumulation (DA) of starch reserves. Measurements were made after a steady-state adjustment period of 50 min in the dark (for DA plants) and 50 min in the light (for NA plants). Data are means ± se. No significant differences exist between wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 values (Student’s t test, P = 0.194 and 0.993 for the NA and DA data sets, respectively).DISCUSSION Plant Growth/Development, Photosynthetic Performance, ATP, and Carbon Sinks Our high-throughput phenomics platform (Figs. 1 and 2) allowed the detection of small but significant changes in physiological parameters and photosynthetic performance. The analysis of PET showed significantly decreased rates for linear electron flux, measured as ΦII, in the ADT mutants relative to the wild-type plants (Figs. 2B and 4A). Detailed analysis of this PET reduction revealed that it resulted from an elevated qE (Figs. 2C and 4B), which causes heat dissipation of the harvested sunlight no longer available for photosynthesis. Further analyses indicated that the increased qE in adt3/4/5/6 resulted from a higher ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane, as measured by ECS (Fig. 5B). Our data also indicated that transitory starch in chloroplasts could serve, at least in part, as an alternative carbon sink in ADT-deficient plants. That is, in the adt3/4/5/6 knockout, the starch content was increased by more than 60% in DA plants and all other knockouts also had elevated starch contents even after 70 DAS (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, comparing starch contents (Fig. 3A) with secondary metabolite data (Fig. 3, B–E) revealed an inverse relationship that provisionally suggested the redirection of fixed carbon from phenylpropanoid metabolites into starch. Yet, the growth curve for adt3/4/5/6 (Fig. 2A) also indicated that additional carbon used from transitory starch reserves in the night was not utilized to increase plant growth in the mutant. In fact, growth was retarded slightly in the quadruple mutant as compared with wild-type plants. This could be interpreted as an indication that the excess carbon/energy (i.e. by reduced metabolism into phenylpropanoid metabolites/lignins) was not used for enhanced plant growth. Indeed, the carbon stored was transitory, as the starch was fully metabolized when photosynthesis was shut down in the NA period (Fig. 3A, left). Where this catabolized fixed carbon ends up is currently unknown. A potential direct connection between secondary metabolism produced by carbon processing through ADT and photosynthesis is ATP. Metabolic pathways leading to lignin and other phenylpropanoids utilize considerable amounts of ATP (Lewis and Yamamoto, 1989). It is not clear, however, whether this ATP comes from respiration, photosynthesis, or both. Yet, with the ADT-catalyzed conversion of arogenate to Phe being localized in the chloroplast, it is possible that ATP produced by photosynthetic light reactions makes a major contribution. Increased starch content is in line with an expected reduction in the putative ATP consumption in ADT knockouts (i.e. since starch synthesis requires ATP; Geigenberger et al., 2005). Thus, it seems that the transient accumulation of starch could be related to the diminished level of ATP required for phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignin biosynthesis in ADT knockouts. The photosynthetic performance measurements of adt3/4/5/6 also indicated that starch synthesis only partly compensated for the reduced demand for ATP consumption. This became apparent by analyzing the correlation between starch contents and linear electron transport (measured as ΦII) for the wild type and all ADT knockouts (Fig. 7B). Higher starch accumulation in the different knockouts was accompanied by a lower linear photosynthetic electron flux. This suggests a limited consumption of extra ATP produced in the mutants by the formation of transitory starch with feedback to electron transport by an increased PMF (Fig. 5). The quadruple mutant, though, still has higher ATP levels, as indicated by elevated ΔpH that leads to higher qE and lower electron flux and the elevated ATP/ADP ratio. In this way, reduced phenylpropanoid biosynthesis can be envisaged to have two interconnected consequences for photosynthesis: (1) reduced consumption of fixed carbon by the Calvin-Benson cycle, leading to an increase in transitory starch; and (2) lowered consumption of ATP, leading to slightly lower electron transport rates via an increase in the feedback regulation of qE.Metabolomics As anticipated, some of the most marked effects observed at the end of the photosynthetic measurement period were the reductions in levels of metabolites derived directly from Phe (i.e. flavonoids, monomeric phenylpropanoids, and lignans). In contrast, the levels of the phytohormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid were below detection limits under the conditions employed (data not shown). For those metabolite classes detected, the largest reductions were observed in the multiple ADT knockout mutants, whereas the smallest reductions were associated with single knockouts (i.e. adt1, adt3, adt4, and adt5). More specifically, in the quadruple knockout adt3/4/5/6, levels of the Phe-derived lignans (Figs. 3D and 6C) and gluconasturtiin (Fig. 6F) were most affected (∼67% and ∼77% reductions, respectively), which was comparable to the lignin content reductions of ∼70% in adt3/4/5/6 plants under long-day growth/development (Corea et al., 2012). By contrast, compared with those in the wild type, Phe-derived flavonoid (Figs. 3B and 6A) and phenolic glucoside (Figs. 3E and 6D), as well as overall glucosinolate (Fig. 6E), levels in adt3/4/5/6 were reduced by only ∼30% to ∼45%, and those of phenylpropanoids (Figs. 3C and 6B) were reduced by only by 25%. Nevertheless, under short-day growth conditions, the knockout of individual ADT genes led to somewhat different outcomes than those observed for lignin contents in long-day-grown plants (Corea et al., 2012). Specifically, the adt1 knockout displayed the greatest reduction in levels of metabolites derived directly from Phe, especially for monomeric phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Conversely, lignin contents under long-day growth/development were reduced the most in adt5, whereas there was no detectable effect on lignin contents in adt1 plants (Corea et al., 2012). Additionally, glucosinolate levels were most reduced in adt4 (Fig. 6E), whereas they had no reduction in lignin contents (Corea et al., 2012). These data apparently suggest quite a distinct role in metabolic pathway carbon allocation and could indicate a specific role for ADT4 in, for example, gluconasturtiin biosynthesis. Although the reduction in Phe-derived gluconasturtiin content described above was expected, the reductions in the levels of other glucosinolates were striking. That is, partial blockage of Phe biosynthesis also led to reduced levels of glucosinolates that are biosynthetically independent of Phe. This pleiotropic effect (i.e. when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits) is nevertheless consistent with previous research suggesting possible cross talk between glucosinolate and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways (Hemm et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2015; Mach, 2015). Furthermore, this class of Brassicaceae metabolites (Matthäus and Luftmann, 2000), characteristic of Arabidopsis, is used as defense compounds and has long been linked directly to responses to wounding and insect herbivory. Their effectiveness is due to the release of toxic isothiocyanates (Grubb and Abel, 2006; Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006; Beekwilder et al., 2008). Clearly, a reduction in the levels of both phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates could potentially lessen overall chemical defenses of ADT-deficient plants, thus causing negative effects regarding fitness. Lastly, the global metabolomics analysis of leaf tissue extracts from the various ADT mutants and the wild type, initially used for the selection of metabolites of interest, is revisited by focusing on the annotated compounds among the hundreds of significantly altered features (Supplemental Table S1). HCA (Fig. 9A) and PLSDA (Fig. 9B) analyses can be presented in a form that provides a comprehensive view of the data, clearly illustrating the trends observed. In this regard, HCA groups features that are based on trends across samples, with above-average features in red and below-average features in green. In Figure 9A, we can clearly observe two main groups of opposite behavior, namely those that accumulate to lower levels in ADT knockout lines and those that accumulate to higher amounts. The first and largest group contains flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, lignans, phenolic glucosides, and glucosinolates. The second group consists of the putative apocarotenoid compounds that are present in higher amounts in the knockout lines and the putative galactolipids, with the latter subject to a pronounced circadian rhythm effect (Fig. 6G). The PLSDA analysis simplifies multiple variables (features) into two orthogonal components that clearly distinguish between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 and between DA and NA plants (Fig. 9B). In this analysis, we can see not only separation of the different groups of samples but, with the overlaid loadings for the different annotated metabolites, we can also rapidly visualize those metabolites that are characteristic of the different lines and harvest times. The strongest effect is in the separation of the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, with the Phe-derived compounds, phenolic glucosides, and glucosinolates being characteristic of the wild type and galactolipids and putative apocarotenoids associated with adt3/4/5/6. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Metabolite profiling in the wild type (WT) and ADT mutants. A, Metabolite heat map generated using MeV version 4.8 from data normalized using naringenin as an internal standard and transformed to have zero mean and unit variance. The heat map displays major trends observed in the levels of annotated metabolites, with clustering based on feature intensity patterns across samples. B, PLSDA analysis of wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 DA and NA plants based on annotated metabolites, with clear separation of sample groups and time of harvest. The loadings show those metabolic features that are more characteristic of the sample groups.Carbon Fixation and Respiration Rates Our data show higher levels of starch accumulation but do not show significantly higher rates of carbon fixation in Arabidopsis plants with compromised ADT activity. This corroborates the additional observation that we do not see overall significant biomass differences between wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants. Photorespiration is typically thought of as a mechanism for a plant to mitigate the accidental fixation of oxygen instead of CO2. Our data (Fig. 8), however, show no significant difference in the rates of overall CO2 release between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6. Since we only detected the overall net release of CO2 from the plant, we cannot determine whether this CO2 came from respiration or photorespiration. Future RTAM-MS focusing on oxygen uptake flux analysis, such as using 18O2, may be an interesting extension of this study to see if any utilization of starch accumulation results in significant variations in photorespiration rates in the wild type compared with adt3/4/5/6.CONCLUSION Our high-throughput phenomics approach allowed us to visualize small changes in photosynthetic and growth performance in ADT knockouts. The data established that reduced metabolism through Phe, leading to reductions in the levels of various phenylpropanoids and other metabolites, has a moderate impact on PET that is most likely caused by impaired recycling of ADP + Pi. Additionally, the metabolomic analysis significantly increased our understanding of the effects of ADT modulation in Arabidopsis, as partial blockage of this crucial biosynthetic pathway has significant and widespread metabolic effects. We established significant reductions in the contents of several phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites, including flavonoids, lignans, and glucosinolates, at both harvesting points (44 and 70 DAS). Our metabolomic analysis also revealed a number of systemic pleiotropic effects of the genetic manipulations. These effects included reductions in glucosinolate and phenolic glucoside contents, with related increases in the levels of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. The small impairment of photosynthetic energy conversion, however, indicates that the metabolic engineering of lignin biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism demonstrated here could be a viable strategy to improve, for example, biofuel crops. Examples exist where only small changes in photosynthetic performance visible under controlled greenhouse conditions translate to much more pronounced effects in field-grown plants (Lawson et al., 2012). A good example is the PsbS knockout mutant (impaired in qE) that displays a similar electron transport rate in the laboratory but significantly reduced fitness under field conditions (Külheim et al., 2002). Thus, the small changes measured in this study may have greater effects in field conditions. This highlights the need in future studies to assess changes in physiological parameters under both greenhouse and field conditions and to determine to what extent, if any, plant fitness is compromised. The results of this study show that engineering one pathway alone may not be sufficient to improve certain traits. In particular, further improvements of ATP consumption can be a follow-up approach to make ADT mutants an interesting model for the improvement of, for example, biofuel conversion efficiencies.MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Optima-grade water, acetonitrile, and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Quercetin-3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside, quercetin-3-glucoside-2ʹʹ-rhamnoside-7-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-glucoside-2ʹʹ-rhamnoside-7-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3,7-dirhamnoside, coniferin, sinapic acid glucoside, sinapoyl malate, pinoresinol-4,4ʹ-di-O-β-d-glucoside, and pinoresinol-4-O-β-d-glucoside were isolated and identified by comparison with authentic standards isolated previously by our group. The glucosinolates glucoraphanin, gluconasturtiin, and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin were identified by comparison with authentic standards kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Giddings Vassão.Plant Growth and Measurements in the Phenomics Facility Wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) and mutants (adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6, generated as described [Corea et al., 2012]) were sown and grown in a growth chamber for 20 d and then moved to the phenomics facility. Plants were grown in eight to 12 blocks in four independent sets (Fig. 1, A–C), with each set having a randomized arrangement of genotypes per block. They were monitored in the phenomics facility for 15 to 30 d after being transferred. Both chambers utilized a 9-h photoperiod at 200 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 illumination, with daily temperatures of 23°C/21°C (light/dark). Measurements were performed daily, once in the middle of the photoperiod (day) and once in the middle of the dark period (night). Measurements were taken by utilizing a movable camera unit, the Fluorcam XYZ (PSI). This instrument is a mobile, programmable fluorescence imaging robot capable of moving throughout the growth chamber on a gantry, performing automated measurements utilizing blue (455 nm) and red (618 nm) LEDs to excite fluorescence, with a light intensity of 200 μmol quanta m2 s–1. Fluorescence was captured by a Fluorcam 2701 LU camera equipped with a fluorescence filter. The software then automatically calculates and exports many parameters, such as Fv/Fm (maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry), ΦII, NPQ, qE, and qL (fraction of open PSII reaction centers; i.e. with reduced primary quinone acceptor QA) according to the following formulae: where Fm and Fm′ are maximal fluorescence from NA and DA leaf, respectively; Fm′′ is the maximal fluorescence in the dark after illumination; Fo and Fo′ are minimal fluorescence from NA and DA leaf, respectively; and Fs is steady-state fluorescence emission from DA leaf. DA measurements of photosynthetic parameters were done at the middle of the light period. The camera carrier moved over the plants with carrier lights on that matches the light intensity in the growth room. Thus, plants were illuminated all the time. For the NA samples, we used a standard protocol of 3 min that includes Fm measurements. After 3 min of illumination, photosynthetic parameters do not change significantly (i.e. a steady state is reached).Measurements in the Flash Spectrometer Flash spectrometry measurements were performed in a laboratory setting on wild-type and knockout plants grown in the phenomics facility and harvested 6 weeks after sowing. Plants were adapted to each of the six different light intensities of 70, 120, 200, 300, 500, and 850 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 and then measured using a DIRK approach. DIRK is used to quantify steady-state electron fluxes through photosynthesis in light-adapted samples by analyzing the kinetics of the relaxation of spectroscopic signals (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000). This relaxation of spectroscopic signals occurs during short dark intervals that are achieved by shuttering off the actinic light (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000). Minimum fluorescence was determined for 2 s at 2 μmol quanta m–2 s–1, and Fm and Fm′ were determined with a 0.6-s light pulse at 2,000 μmol quanta m–2 s–1. The photosynthetic parameters ΦII and NPQ were calculated as above. For ECS measurements, plants were preilluminated for 10 min at 100 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 and then adapted for 2 min to six light intensities (70, 120, 200, 300, 500, and 850 μmol quanta m–2 s–1). For each light intensity, the ECS was measured as absorption change at 520 nm (Witt, 1979; Bailleul et al., 2010). The maximal ECS amplitude (reflecting the maximal PFM) was determined as the difference of the 520-nm absorption signal in the light minus the 520-nm signal in the subsequent dark pulse (arrow in Fig. 5A). This was repeated for all light intensities (Fig. 5). ECS measurements were tested in the direction of increasing light intensity followed directly by decreasing light intensities. As no hysteresis effect was apparent between both directions, measurements were performed with decreasing light intensities for all genotypes.ATP and ADP Determination Wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 mutant plants were dark adapted overnight or taken from the phenomics facility after 6 h of illumination. Ten leaf discs (with 45.6 mm2 surface area) were harvested from DA and NA plants, pooled in one e-cup, and shock frozen immediately in liquid N2. Each harvested and frozen plant material was homogenized in the TissueLyserII (Qiagen) before the addition of 200 μL of ATP or ADP buffer of the ATP/ADP calorimetric assay kit (BioVision). Samples were individually sonicated with a Sonicator Microtip (Sonicator S 4000; Branso) for 3 × 30 s (at 30–50 J) to ensure complete extraction of the aqueous phase from the leaf discs. After centrifugation, an aliquot (30 μL) of each supernatant was added to 40 μL of ATP or ADP buffer and mixed with 50 μL of the reaction mix from either the ATP or ADP kit. The reaction mix contained either the ATP or ADP probe, ATP or ADP converter, and ATP or ADP developer (BioVision). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, each absorption was measured at 570 and 600 nm to account for the chlorophyll signal. Subtraction of the chlorophyll signal at 600 nm led to the corrected absorption value at 570 nm that was used for the calculation of ADP or ATP amount (nmol) using the respective ADP or ATP calibration curve. The calibration curve for ATP was generated using 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 nmol final concentration of the ATP standard. The calibration curve for ADP was generated using 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 nmol final concentration of the ADP standard. Data were averaged from six to eight biological replicates per genotype.Plant Harvesting and Metabolite Extraction Two sets of Arabidopsis plants were subjected to metabolomics analyses, one at 44 DAS and the second at 70 DAS, where, in each case, leaf tissues from nine individual plants of each genotype were collected, at the end of the light (DA) and dark (NA) periods, respectively, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then freeze dried and kept at −80°C until subjected to solvent extraction. Freeze-dried samples were weighed (∼14–23 mg) and individually ground to fine powder using the TissueLyserII (Qiagen) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz. Methanol:water (70:30, v/v) containing 0.05 mm naringenin (Aldrich) as an internal standard was individually added at a ratio of 1 mL to 50 mg of tissue powder. Samples were vortexed for a few seconds, sonicated at room temperature for 10 min, vortexed again, and finally centrifuged at 16,000g (4°C for 15 min). Supernatants were individually transferred to 1.5-mL screw-cap glass vials and stored at −80°C until analysis. The pellets in each case also were stored at −80°C prior to starch analysis.UPLC-qTOF-MS Analysis Metabolite analyses were performed using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters) equipped with a photodiode array eλ detector (Waters) and coupled to a Xevo G2 QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies) using MassLynx (version 4.1) software. Separation of metabolites was performed using a BEH C18 column (Waters; 100 × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 µm particle size). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (phase A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B). The linear gradient program was as follows: 100% A over 0.5 min, 0% to 45% (v/v) B over 25 min, 45% to 100% (v/v) B over 1 min, held at 100% B for a further 3.5 min, then returned to the initial conditions (100% A) in 0.5 min, followed by reconditioning at 100% A for 10 min. The flow rate was 0.2 mL min−1, with column temperature kept at 25°C and samples at 5°C. Spectra were recorded between 200 and 500 nm with a resolution of 1.2 nm. The masses of eluted compounds were detected using an electrospray ionization source in the negative ion mode. The following settings were applied: capillary voltage at 2.2 kV, cone voltage at 20 eV, and collision energy at 6 and 30 eV; argon was used as the collision gas. For LC-MS/MS analyses (Supplemental Table S2), 5- to 50-, 30-, and 30- to 60-eV collision energies were used. The m/z range was 50 to 1,000 D. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using sodium formate, and Leu enkephalin was employed as the lock mass. The injection volume was 2 μL for LC-MS analysis and 4 μL for LC-MS/MS.Metabolomics Data Processing Chromatograms obtained from UPLC-photodiode array-qTOF-MS analysis were inspected visually in MassLynx software (Waters) with obvious outliers excluded. In order to conduct subsequent data processing, .RAW data files were converted to NetCDF using MassLynx’s Databridge software. NetCDF files were then processed in RStudio (version 0.9.332) using the package XCMS (Smith et al., 2006; https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu) for feature (unique mass/retention time signals, MxxxTxxx) detection and retention time correction, followed by the CAMERA package (Kuhl et al., 2012; https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html) for features grouping together and for partial annotation. XCMS-based feature detection and integration were performed using the Centwave method (Tautenhahn et al., 2008) with the following parameters: prefilter = c(0,0), snthr = 2, ppm = 15, peakwidth = c(5,20), and nSlaves = 4. Retention time correction was performed twice via the obiwarp method with the following parameters: bw = 2, minfrac = 0.5, mzwid = 0.015, and plottype = c(‘deviation’). The CAMERA package was used with the following parameters: perfwhm = 0.6 and groupCorr, findIsotopes, and findAdducts with polarity = ‘negative’. Pairwise comparison in XCMS was conducted after setting the two groups, one including all wild-type samples (both DA and NA) and one including all mutant line samples (both DA and NA). After initial XCMS and CAMERA processing, TSV and CSV files generated were combined and further analyzed manually (Supplemental Table S1). Feature lists were normalized to the internal standard naringenin (integrated in XCMS results as feature M271T1196, Rt 19.93, m/z 271.0608 [calculated 271.0606 for C15H11O5]) for statistical analysis. Comparisons between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 (either from DA or NA plants) were performed separately for the selection of statistically significant features subjected to annotation efforts. Box plots were made using Excel with the following results obtained: P value (−log10 [P]) and fold change for pairwise comparison between the wild type and each ADT mutant (NA and DA) and for NA versus DA in the wild type and each ADT mutant (Supplemental Table S1). For HCA and PLSDA, data were transformed to zero mean and unit variance. The annotated features (after the removal of isotopes, adducts, and fragments) were imported to MeV version 4.8 and subsequently clustered using the following settings for hierarchical clustering: tree selection = gene tree, ordering optimization = optimize gene leaf order, distance metric selection = optimize gene leaf order, linkage method selection = average linkage clustering. PLSDA of NA_wild type, DA_wild type, NA_adt3/4/5/6, and DA_adt3/4/5/6 was performed using DeviumWeb (version 0.4; Grapov, 2014).Metabolite Identification and Annotation Information obtained from computational processing was used as a starting point for manual peak identification. Metabolites were then identified by comparison with standard compounds of their retention time, UV spectra, and MS/MS fragmentation. Other metabolites were putatively annotated using the following two approaches: (1) putative molecular formulae calculated from accurate mass and isotopic pattern recognition were used to screen the Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/index.php) and SciFinder Scholar (SciFinder Scholar 20##, https://scifinder.cas.org/scifinder/login.jsf) metabolite databases as well as other sources, including KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and the Plant Metabolic Network (http://www.plantcyc.org/) databases; and (2) MS/MS fragmentation of metabolites (Supplemental Table S2) was compared with candidate molecules found in databases (ReSpect for Phytochemicals [http://spectra.psc.riken.jp/] and Massbank [http://www.massbank.jp/]) and verified with earlier literature, especially for metabolites reported previously in Arabidopsis.Starch Quantification Following the extract preparation for metabolomic analyses above, the corresponding pellets were individually subjected to starch quantification. Each pellet sample was next washed three times with 1 mL of ethanol: water (80:20, v/v) with sonication at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 16,000g, with solvent discarded. A 0.2 n potassium hydroxide solution in water was then added to each sample at a ratio of 1 mL to 40 mg of sample (i.e. the freeze-dried plant material, prior to metabolite extraction), and gelatinization was conducted at 85°C for 45 min. After cooling down to room temperature, acetic acid (1 n) was added for neutralization at a ratio of 0.2 mL to 40 mg of sample (as above), and samples were individually vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000g and 25°C for 15 min. Amyloglucosidase solution (A-1602; Sigma) was prepared at 100 units mL–1, and digestion proceeded by adding the solution (40 μL) to each supernatant (60 μL) and incubating for 15 min at 60°C in a shaking water bath. Acetonitrile (100 μL) was added immediately to each sample after digestion. Finally, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000g at 4°C for 15 min. Supernatants (180 μL) and 10 mg mL–1 Xyl solution (20 μL) were transferred into screw-cap glass vials and analyzed. Released Glc was quantified using an HPLC device (2695; Waters) coupled to an evaporative light-scattering detector (2424; Waters) equipped with a Supercosil LC-NH column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 µm; Supelco). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: water (75:25, v/v), the flow rate was 0.5 mL min−1, with nebulizer temperature of 70°C and N2 pressure at 50 p.s.i. The injection volume was 5 μL. Xyl in each sample solution was used as an internal standard. By using isocratic elution, Xyl and Glc were resolved and eluted at 11.2 and 13.6 min, respectively. A control recovery test was performed using starch standard powder (S5296; Sigma), giving 100% ± 10% recovery. Calibration curves for Glc exhibited good polynomial expression, with correlation coefficients of 0.9993 (0.125–0.5 mg mL–1) to 0.9985 (0.5–1.5 mg mL–1). A standard solution containing 1 mg mL–1 Xyl and 0 to 2 mg mL–1 Glc was used (5-μL injection volume) to monitor the evaporative light-scattering detection reproducibility throughout the runs.RTAM-MS of CO2 Wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants (56 DAS) were placed in an in-house-built isolation/exposure chamber (Supplemental Fig. S4) and were sealed. The chamber was made of clear polycarbonate for light penetration and was modified with three Swagelock connection ports in the lid to allow air flow in and to control air/gas flow to a vacuum or to a Shimadzu QP2010 single quad mass spectrometer with an electron-impact source for analysis. NA plants were kept in the dark for 12 h to consume all starch reserves, and DA plants were kept in the light for 12 h within an environmental growth chamber to allow for starch accumulation. A flow rate of 200 mL min–1 was used to initially purge the chamber and to maintain a constant atmospheric CO2 level throughout each plant acclimation period. The mass spectrometer was calibrated by running a series of volumetrically prepared CO2 standards. Data acquisition began with the analysis of just the room air CO2 concentration for 15 min, then a valve was switched and the plants that had acclimated for 12 h in either the light (DA) or dark (NA) were analyzed by measuring the air that passes around the plant and that enters the mass spectrometer. The flow rate of this analysis was set at 2 mL min–1 CO2 concentration and was monitored over 30 min to allow the CO2 concentration measurement to stabilize and arrive at a steady state. The average concentration at the last 5 min of the 30-min period was used to calculate the total CO2 concentration of the air plus what was released or fixed by the plant. Then, the light was either turned on for the NA plants or turned off for the DA plants, and the CO2 concentration was allowed to stabilize and reach a steady state for another 50 min. The last 5 min of this period was used to determine the CO2 released or absorbed under light or dark conditions in plants depleted of starch (NA) or in which starch accumulated (DA). After analysis, the aboveground portion of the plant was dried and weighed to normalize the measurements to dry weight. Plantless pots with soil also were evaluated under the same conditions. CO2 levels attributed to release from the soil and room atmosphere were subtracted from the experimental CO2 measurements to obtain the levels attributed to just the plant.Accession Numbers Accession numbers are as follows: At1g11790 (ADT1), At3g07630 (ADT2), At2g27820 (ADT3), At3g44720 (ADT4), At5g22630 (ADT5), and At1g08250 (ADT6).Supplemental Data The following supplemental materials are available.

    "title": "New insights into lignification via network and multi-omics analyses of arogenate dehydratase knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185232/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants. Keywords: lignin, arogenate dehydratases, multi-omics, network analysis, Arabidopsis, ribocode",
    "introduction": "Introduction Arogenate is an important branch-point to either tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe) in vascular plants, whose formation from arogenate (Agn) is catalyzed by arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), respectively (Figure 1). The Phe so formed can then be incorporated into either proteins or massively utilized in the phenylpropanoid pathway to produce lignins, as well as other related metabolites (e.g., lignans, allyl/propenyl phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthocyanins) depending upon the species. In our earlier studies, homozygous single and multiple Arabidopsis ADT knock-out (KO) lines with homologous T-DNA insertion mutations were obtained, with the most extreme phenotypes showing an ∼70% reduction in lignin content as compared to wild type (WT) plants (Corea et al., 2012a, b, c). Phenotypes of the former also displayed prostrate stems and lowest stem dry weights/heights. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Simplified metabolic pathways linking photosynthesis, carbon fixation and lignin biosynthesis, as well as placement of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) between the chorismate-shikimate, aromatic amino acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways in vascular plant systems. Selected metabolites are illustrated along with enzymes depicted by arrows. Differentially varying lignin levels as above, obtained through systematic manipulation of the 6-membered Arabidopsis ADT gene family (ADT1, At1g11790; ADT2, At3g07630; ADT3, At2g27820; ADT4, At3g44720; ADT5, At5g22630, and ADT6, At1g08250), thus offered the opportunity to investigate the holistic nature of such perturbations on overall Arabidopsis systems biology. To do this, we carried out multi-omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analyses of leaf and stem tissues of single (adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, and adt6), double, triple and quadruple (adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6) KO mutant and WT lines, at 4 weeks of growth/development. In this study, multi-omics “normalization” strategies were employed to enable direct integration and visualization of the disparate “omics” datasets of related transcripts, proteins and metabolites, thereby allowing for greater understanding, confidence and validation of resulting systemic biological perturbations observed. Network analysis (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) was also used to (a) identify enzymes or processes most highly correlated to different lignin levels, and (b) reveal potentially novel enzymes or processes related with lignin level regulation and biosynthesis. This analysis resulted in our provisionally deducing novel transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulatory processes, when carbon flux was reduced in the phenylpropanoid pathway and which profoundly affected lignin deposition. Many proteins identified in our network analysis have not been reported as potentially linked to lignin biosynthesis regulation. For example, several ribosome subunits with high correlations to lignin level profiles were identified, suggesting the possible presence of a “ribocode.” These proteins, as well as other ribosome-interacting mRNA processing proteins detected in our network analysis, indicate that vascular plant lignin levels are not only controlled at the point of transcription but work together with modulating factors at a post-transcriptional and translational level as described below.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Chemicals For metabolomics analyses, OptimaTM grade water, acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, United States). Authentic standards used for secondary metabolite metabolomics are described in Höhner et al. (2018). For proteomics and RNA-Seq sample preparation, nanopure water was used and all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States) and were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted. Arabidopsis T-DNA Knock Out (KO) Insertion Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Columbia) T-DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL)1. Individual ADT KO mutant lines were created in homozygous form, with individual lines crossed to ultimately provide double, triple, and quadruple homozygous ADT KO mutants (Corea et al., 2012c). Plant Growth and Harvesting Conditions A. thaliana WT (Columbia) and KO mutant lines were grown in Institute of Biological Chemistry (Washington State University) greenhouses with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 27–28°C/24–26°C, respectively. Nitrogen-based fertilizer (200 ppm) was added five times a week. Plants were harvested at 4 weeks after planting with rosette leaf and stem tissues individually collected and immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2. Each sample was stored at −80°C until further analysis. Primary Metabolite Derivatization Nine individual plants of each line were frozen in liquid N2 and freeze-dried. Dry plant tissues were ground into fine powders using a tissue-lyzer II (Qiagen, Germany) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz at −80°C. Powdered freeze-dried Arabidopsis leaves or stems (20 mg) were individually suspended in 500 μL of methanol:2-iso-propanol:water (5:2:2, v/v/v). After adding 13C labeled ribitol standard (1.5 μg), each material was extracted by vortexing for 10 min, followed by sonication for 5 min. Extracts were individually centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, with supernatants transferred to a new vial and subsequently dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually re-suspended in water:acetonitrile (500 μL, 1:1 v/v), and re-extracted by sequential vortexing and sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min with supernatants then removed and dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually suspended in O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (40 mg mL–1 in pyridine, 5 μL, Sigma) and incubated for 90 min at 30°C at 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer). Subsequently, samples were individually derivatized with MSTFA (45 μL) with 1% TMCS (Thermo-Pierce) for 30 min at 37°C and 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer). Primary Metabolite Analysis Using Gas Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Analyses were performed using a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO) equipped with a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and an Agilent 7890A oven. Derivatization products were separated on a (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. ×0.25 μm) Rxi®-5Sil column (Restek) with an IntegraGuard® pre-column using ultrapure He at a constant flow of 1 mL min–1 as carrier gas. The linear thermal gradient started with 1 min at 50°C, followed by a ramp to 330°C at 20°C min–1. Final temperature was held for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions and mass spectra were collected at 17 spectra s–1. The injection port was held at 250°C, and an aliquot of the sample (1 μL) was injected. GC-MS Data Processing Peak annotation employed the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind et al., 2009), where an identity score cutoff of 600 was used. Peak alignment and mass spectra comparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare feature of the ChromaTOF® software (LECO). Surrogate standard 13C ribitol and original tissue weight were used for normalization. Secondary Metabolomic Analysis Using Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried material from each individual plant tissue (10 mg) as described (Lu et al., 2017) in 200 μL of methanol:water (70:30, v/v) containing naringenin (Aldrich) as an internal standard. Samples were vortexed, sonicated for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Supernatants were individually stored at −80°C until analysis. Samples were analyzed using a Waters AcquityTM Ultra Performance LC system as described in Lu et al. (2017) with the following modifications: Liquid chromatography was performed using a 100 × 2.1 mm i.d. (1.7 μm particle size) UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters). Masses of eluted compounds were detected using an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the negative ion mode with capillary voltage at 2.2 kV; cone voltage at 20 eV; collision energy at 6 eV and at 30 eV. Chromatograms and spectra were inspected, and raw data files and metabolite assignments were determined as described previously (Lu et al., 2017). Before statistical analysis, feature integration results were normalized to internal standard naringenin (M271T1197_1, retention time 1197 s and m/z (average) 271.0609 and calculated 271.0606, for C15H11O5). Many metabolites were unambiguously identified by comparison with retention times, UV spectra and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of authentic standard compounds. Other metabolites were putatively annotated based on accurate mass, isotopic pattern recognition, and MS/MS spectra. These were searched in both the literature and publicly available mass spectral databases [i.e., Metlin, ReSpect2, Massbank3, and HMDB4 ]. RNA Extraction and Illumina HiSeq Analysis For each sample, liquid nitrogen frozen tissue sample (100 mg) was ground using a mortar and pestle cooled in presence of liquid nitrogen. A SpectrumTM Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was employed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control was performed on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop with all 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm readings above 1.8. Illumina TruSeq RNA libraries were constructed per the manufacturer’s protocol, with quality evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Six lanes were multiplexed with five samples per lane in the single ended, 50 bp configuration. A mean of 41 M reads passing quality filters was obtained for each sample (min. 31 M, max. 50 M). Cluster generation used the cBot SR Cluster Gen Kit (V3) and the flow cell used was SR FC Information (V3). RNA-Seq Data Workup CyVerse (formerly iPlant Collaborative)5 (Goff et al., 2011), was used for analysis and evaluation of the HiSeq data. Once all FASTQ files produced from the Illumina sequencing were uploaded into the Discovery Environment (DE), the TopHat2-SE App, which comprised TopHat 2.0.9 and Bowtie 2.1.0, was used to align the RNA-Seq reads to the A. thaliana TAIR10 genome using the short read aligner Bowtie which is capable of analyzing the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons. The reference genome and reference annotations used the A. thaliana TAIR10 genome (A. thaliana Ensembl 19). Default analysis options were used with the exception of the FASTQ quality scale of Illumina 1.3-1.8 (PHRED64). Anchor length: 8; Maximum number of mismatches that can appear in the anchor region of spliced alignment: 0; The minimum intron length: 70; the maximum intron length: 50000; Minimum isoform fraction: 0.15; Maximum number of alignments to be allowed: 20; Minimum intron length that may be found during split-segment (default) search: 50; Maximum intron length that may be found during split-segment (default) search: 500000; Number of mismatches allowed in each segment alignment for reads mapped independently: 2; Minimum length of read segments: 20. Next, Cufflinks2 (an interface for Cufflinks version 2.1.1) located in the DE of CyVerse was used to link short read RNA-Seq alignments found from the TopHat analysis to the reference annotations from the TAIR10 genome. Cufflinks identified sequences that did not align with the annotated genome and labels them with novel identifiers. Default settings were used in Cufflinks. These parameters included abundance estimation options of: Number of importance for samples generated for each locus: 1000; Number of iterations allowed during MLE (maximum-likelihood estimates) of abundances: 5000; Prefix for transcripts in reported GTF (General Transfer Format): Cuff; Minimum isoform fraction: 0.1; Pre-mRNA fraction: 0.1; Maximum intron length: 300000; Alpha value for the binomial test used during false positive spliced alignment filtration: 0.001; Small anchor fraction: 0.09; Minimum fragments per transfrag: 10; The number of bp allowed to enter the intron of a transcript when determining if a read or another transcript is map-able with it: 8; Maximum genomic length allowed for a given bundle: 3500000; Minimum intron length: 50; Minimum average coverage required to attempt 3′ trimming: 10; The fraction of average coverage below which to trim the 3′ end of an assembled transcript: 0.1. Next, the HTSeq-with-BAM-input app in the CyVerse site was used to produce count data from the BAM files using default parameter values. Protein Extraction and Digestion Ice cold 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol (10 mL) and β-mercaptoethanol (250 μL) were added to each pulverized powder sample (ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle) followed by vigorous shaking for 15 s. For stem tissues, a Polytron homogenizer was used for about 30 s at a speed of 30 to further homogenize them. Samples were individually placed in a −20°C freezer for 2 h, and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4°C. Each supernatant was next removed and discarded. The above addition of ammonium acetate/methanol solution and centrifugation steps were repeated four more times to remove metabolites and lipids from each sample. Excess methanol was removed by drying the pellets gently under a flow of nitrogen for ∼2 min. A protein solubilization solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 5 mM of neutralized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Bond-Breaker, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, United States) was added to each sample to completely cover each pellet, plus 500 μL more. Samples were then individually incubated at 4°C overnight. Debris from each was physically mixed into solution with a pipette tip and the slurry sonicated in a Hielscher UTR200 ultrasonic processor for 10–20 s at 100% amplitude. Protein slurries were next individually incubated at 60°C for 30 min, with samples vortexed and sonicated in the sonoreactor again for about 30 s. Each sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4°C. A Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States), using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard, was next conducted on individual supernatants to estimate protein contents. Afterward, denatured samples were diluted tenfold with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). CaCl2 was added to a concentration of 2 mM and trypsin (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) was added at a trypsin:sample ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Samples were individually digested overnight at 37°C and then alkylated with chloroacetamide at a concentration of 5 mM in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Peptides from each treatment were desalted with an SCX SPE (SUPELCO Supelclean) using 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0), 25% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, to remove CHAPS, and then a 80:15:5 (v/v/v) methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M) was used to elute peptides. C-18 SPE columns (SUPELCO Discovery) were employed to remove ammonium salts, using a 0.1% TFA (v/v) in nanopure water to wash the peptides and a 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile:water with 0.1% (v/v) TFA solvent to elute peptides. Peptides were quantified using a BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States) with a BSA standard. iTRAQ Peptide Labeling Peptides were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQ (AB Sciex, Redwood City, CA, United States) reagents: Each peptide sample (30 μg) was placed in a new tube and dried down. Dissolution buffer (iTRAQ buffer kit, 13 μL) was added to each sample, these being vortexed into solution and centrifuged briefly to draw sample to the bottom of each tube. iTRAQ reagent (10 μL) was diluted further with isopropanol (35 μL), and this was added to each sample. Each reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (200 μL) added to quench each reaction. After 1 h, contents from all iTRAQ channel reactions were added to one tube and then the sample was vortexed and dried down in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. Offline Fractionation of Peptides and Preparation of Proteome Samples Labeled peptides were separated using an off-line high pH (pH 10) reversed-phase (RP) separation with a Waters XBridge C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) and a guard column (4.6 mm × 20 mm) using an Agilent 1200 HPLC System. Each sample loaded onto the C18 column was washed for 15 min with Solvent A [10 mM ammonium formate, adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M)]. The gradient started with a linear increase of 0% Solvent B [10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v)] to: 5% Solvent B over 10 min, 45% Solvent B over 65 min, and then to 100% Solvent B over 15 min. Solvent B was held at 100% for 10 min, and then this was changed to 100% Solvent A, this being held for 20 min to recondition the column. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1. A total of 48 fractions were collected for each sample into a 96 well plate throughout the above LC gradient. The high pH RP fractions were then combined into 12 fractions using the concatenation strategy previously reported (Wang et al., 2011). Peptide fractions were dried down and re-suspended in nanopure water at a concentration of 75 ng μL–1 for mass spectrometry analysis using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos MS (Thermo Scientific) system as described below. Mass-Spectrometry Based Analysis of Peptide Samples The LC system was custom built using two Agilent 1200 nanoflow pumps and one Agilent 1200 cap pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States), various Valco valves (Valco Instruments Co., Houston, TX, United States), and a PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC, United States). Full automation was made possible by custom software that allows for parallel event coordination and therefore near 100% MS duty cycle through use of two trapping and analytical columns. Reversed-phase columns were prepared in-house by slurry packing 3 μm Jupiter C18 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, United States) into 40 cm × 360 μm o.d. ×75 μm i.d. fused silica (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ, United States) using a 1-cm sol-gel frit for media retention (Maiolica et al., 2005). Trapping columns were prepared similarly by slurry packing 5-μm Jupiter C18 into a 4-cm length of 150 μm i.d. fused silica and fritted on both ends. Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) operated at 300 nL–1 min with a linear gradient profile as follows (min:%B): 0:5, 2:8, 20:12, 75:35, 97:60, 100: 85. Sample injections (5 μL) were trapped and washed on the trapping columns at 3 μL min–1 for 20 min prior to alignment with analytical columns. Data acquisition lagged the gradient start and end times by 15 min to account for column dead volume that allowed for the tightest overlap possible in a two-column operation. The two-column operation also allowed for columns to be “washed” (shortened gradients) and re-generated off-line without any cost to duty cycle. The LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode acquiring higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) scans (R = 7,500, 5 × 104 target ions) after each full MS scan (R = 30,000, 3 × 106 target ions) for the top ten most abundant ions within the mass range of 300 to 1,800 m/z. An isolation window of 2.5 Thomson units (Th) was used to isolate ions prior to HCD. All HCD scans used normalized collision energy of 45 and maximum injection time of 1000 ms. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 60 s and charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned and singly charged ions. Peptide Identification and Quantification For peptide identification, MS/MS spectra were searched against a decoy A. thaliana protein TAIR106 database using the algorithm SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994). Search parameters included: no enzyme specificity for proteome data and trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleaves, ±50 ppm precursor mass tolerance, ±0.05 Da product mass tolerance, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines and iTRAQ labeling of lysines and peptide N-termini as fixed modifications. Allowed variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and proline. MS-GF (Kim et al., 2008) spectra probability values were also calculated for peptides identified from SEQUEST searches. Measured mass accuracy and MS-GF spectra probability were used to filter identified peptides to <0.4% false discovery rate (FDR) at spectrum level and <1% FDR at the peptide level using the decoy approach. iTRAQ reporter ions were extracted using the MASIC software (Monroe et al., 2008) with a 10 ppm mass tolerance for each expected iTRAQ reporter ion as determined from each MS/MS spectrum. Protein and Transcript Relative Fold-change, Z-score and P-value Determinations For the protein data, relative abundances of peptides were determined using iTRAQ reporter ion intensity ratios from each MS/MS spectrum. Individual peptide intensity values were determined by dividing the base peak intensity by the relative ratio associated with each reporter ion. Each iTRAQ experiment references a pool of peptides so that all experiments could be linked. All peptide data were combined into a single data table and were transformed to a log2 value, following which each data row of each iTRAQ experiment was shifted so that the reference pool value in each iTRAQ experiment was equal. Then each column of data representing each channel of each iTRAQ experiment was mean centered. All peptide values were next transformed to undo the log2, by calculating 2 to the power of each data point. Peptide abundance values were then separated into two datasets, one of peptides unique to a single protein and peptides which are shared between two or more proteins. Peptides were rolled up to a protein value by summing the peptides that belong to each protein in each dataset. Where the same protein was calculated in both datasets, only one protein value was selected in a final protein rollup table with the protein value from the unique peptide rollup given preference if identified in all channels. Individual protein roll-up calculations from the unique or shared peptide table were designated in the final protein roll-up table. KEGG Orthology protein family groups (KEGOs) were also determined for both protein and transcript data. Protein KEGOs were calculated by summing all unique peptide values found within a KEGO. Transcript KEGOs were calculated by summing all transcript count data within a like KEGO. All protein, transcript and KEGO values were converted to a log2 value. Log2 values below 2 in all protein datasets were removed as these primarily represent noise signals which interfere with z-score calculations. All replicates were averaged, and MA plots were constructed for each comparison between the average value of each WT and mutant line. All fold change pairs analyzed in MA plots, were combined into a single dataset and the values obtained in the A axis were ranked from lowest to highest. A sliding window which represented 10% of the total number of data point was used to calculate the z-score value along the A axis for each data point (in the MA plot). Z-score (z = x-μ/σ = (datapoint–median)/standard deviation). This standardized the log2 fold change distribution among all data points (low and high abundance alike). From the normal distribution of all log2 fold changes, a p-value was calculated for each log2 fold change comparison using the normsdist function in Excel. Network Analysis All proteins with a high Spearman rank correlation (rho > 0.85) to the monomeric guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignin-derived moieties, and which had a z-score ratio value no more than ±0.5 in the adt1 versus WT analysis, were identified in WT and adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6 mutants, and were entered into the STRING network analysis algorithm7 (Szklarczyk et al., 2017) searching against the A. thaliana database. STRING returned protein-protein associations, type of association, and strength of association. Known interactions from either curated databases or which were experimentally determined were considered, along with predicted interactions from gene fusion, gene co-occurrence, gene neighborhood experiments, as well as from text mining, co-expression datasets and protein homology datasets. Node interactions were selected only if STRING returned a minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher and for nodes with at least one interaction. These data were then exported into an interaction table, this then being made into a SIF document and uploaded into Cytoscape 3.4.0 (Smoot et al., 2011). In Cytoscape, the layout attribute Organic was selected under yFiles Layout. Nodes in close proximity were further clustered together manually based on either like KEGG or a gene ortholog (GO) term functional category if no KEGG category existed. Nodes were represented by rectangles colored by a red-blue color scheme to represent z-scores of log2 ratios (ADT KO mutant/WT), where red represents proteins higher in abundance in ADT KO mutants compared to WT, white symbolizes no change, and blue represents proteins higher in abundance in WT compared to ADT KO mutants. The thickness of the edge represents strength of relationship between nodes/proteins, as determined by the final combined score output of STRING. A more focused STRING analysis was carried out just on ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA processing involved proteins to view the putative specific connections. Only associations related to known and predicted interactions were considered. A minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher was used for nodes with at least one interaction.",
    "results": "Results A multi-omics evaluation of Arabidopsis ADT KO mutant lines (compared to WT plants) was conducted at 4 weeks of growth/development, when the plants had fully developed rosette leaves and had stems about 10–20 cm high (∼1/3 height at maturity). For both tissue types, full RNA-Seq transcriptomics, iTRAQ 8-plex multiplexing proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS, together with primary (GC-MS) and secondary (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed. Data interrogation resulted in confident detection (1% FDR) of 27,181 transcripts, 8,672 proteins, together with 132 primary and 30 secondary metabolites. Normalization of Expression Data for Multi-Omics Integration Each biomolecular class (i.e., transcripts, proteins, and metabolites) was measured using disparate workflows. Since only a few replicate analyses were feasible, as is typical for RNA-Seq and proteome analysis, variance estimations were offset by “borrowing” information from genes or proteins across the entire analysis (Subramaniam and Hsiao, 2012). The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM (Tusher et al., 2001), limma (Ritchie et al., 2015), and VAMPIRE (Hsiao et al., 2005)]. We applied this approach to log2 fold change transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data between each ADT KO mutant and WT analysis. Data were first processed as MA-plots (Dudoit et al., 2002; Labbe and Dudoit, 2012) (Supplementary Figure 1), an approach that distributes log2 fold change data (M = y-axis) according to average abundance (A = x-axis) of the two measurements being compared. Log2 fold change calculations for any type of expression data (gene/protein/metabolite) typically form a normal distribution, with subsequent utilization of localized data (or a sliding window of log2 fold change data with similar abundances) enabling calculation of more accurate z-scores and p-values for significance estimations. Resulting z-score calculations then allowed for normalization of data into units of standard deviation (away from an average or zero-fold change value). This normalization then permits integration of datasets obtained on disparate platforms (i.e., Illumina sequencing, mass spectrometry) to be compared directly. Metabolomics Analysis Metabolite profiles represent the ultimate molecular phenotypic indicator of an organism at a specific growth/developmental stage. Metabolites often function as cofactors, energy sources, signaling molecules, polymer precursors (e.g., to cellulose, lignins, proteins, DNA), as well as defense, attractant and effector molecules. In the context of plant bioengineering, metabolomic analyses provide the ultimate validation as to which metabolites are increased or decreased in quantity in response to a genetic change or other perturbation. Here we used two mass spectrometric methods to evaluate the differences between each ADT KO mutant and WT in terms of both primary and secondary metabolism. Supplementary Figures 2, 3 show heat maps displaying z-scores of log2 fold changes between ADT KO mutants and WT for the metabolites identified by GC-MS (i.e., primary metabolites) and LC-MS (i.e., secondary metabolites), respectively. Data were grouped by functional categories, as defined by KEGG8 (Kanehisa et al., 2017), when available. Z-score values pertaining to Supplementary Figures 2, 3 are found in Supplementary Table 1. The GC-MS results (Supplementary Figure 2) are shown as a heat map displaying z-score of the log2 fold change values of each metabolite found in each ADT KO mutant compared to WT. The largest primary metabolite classes identified were related to carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids. Fold-changes found in the carbohydrate class included on average decreases in ascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 2.3 in stem) and dehydroascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 1.5 in stem). While not detected in leaf tissue, melibiose (3.2 fold), and xylitol (2.3 fold) were lower in abundance in the stems. In both leaf and stem tissues, the most significant change of all metabolites identified from GC-MS data was that of an increase in sorbitol (5.9 fold in leaf, 152 fold in stem). Knocking out even a single ADT isoform in Arabidopsis has profound effects on sorbitol biosynthesis, and perhaps on a plant-wide level. Jain et al. (2010) reported that treatment of maize seedlings with increased concentrations of sorbitol (a) decreased total chlorophyll, protein and RNA contents, while increasing proline levels and nitrate reductase activity; and (b) induced a stress response that overall inhibited maize growth. By producing so much sorbitol in vivo, ADT KO mutants may too be experiencing changes in chlorophyll, protein and RNA levels. Moreover, these plant lines may also be under increased levels of stress relative to WT plants. Glycolic acid (2.1 fold in leaf and 2.3 fold in stem) additionally was found to be increased in ADT KO mutants versus WT. Glycolic acid is produced when ribulose bisphosphate (RuBisCo) fixes O2 instead of CO2. The increased presence of glycolic acid in both leaf and stem tissues suggests increased photorespiration pathway utilization, which results in a release of CO2 back to the atmosphere. In stem tissue, other carbohydrates such as D-glyceric acid (2.8 fold), 6-deoxy-D-glucose (10.1 fold), and fructose-6-phosphate (4.1 fold) also had higher levels in ADT KO lines versus WT, whereas significantly increased levels of D-glucoheptose (36.1 fold), allose (4.0 fold), gluconic lactone (3.5 fold), sorbose (2.5 fold), threonic acid (7.3 fold), and glucose-1-phosphate (3.9 fold) were observed in leaves. Amino acids with the most increased levels in the ADT KO mutants versus WT stem tissues included allothreonine (4.2 fold), alanine (2.3 fold), and glutamate (2.2 fold). By contrast, decreases in the ADT KO lines were found for oxoproline (2.4 fold) in the stems. Interestingly, shikimate which is a key metabolite located in the aromatic amino acid/shikimate chorismate pathways upstream of ADT, was, on average, increased (2.6 fold) in ADT KO mutant leaves, but decreased (8.3 fold) in abundance in stem tissues. The LC-MS metabolomics analysis of hydro-alcoholic extracts of leaves and stems led to the detection of numerous important secondary metabolites (Supplementary Figure 3). This approach was chosen based on previous knowledge of important and characteristic metabolites produced by A. thaliana, which include flavonoids, phenylpropanoids (e.g., sinapate esters, lignans) and glucosinolates. We found that putative galactolipids and carotenoids generally increased in abundance in both tissues, whereas most of the identified flavonoids, 1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl sinapate, 5-hydroxyferuloyl malate and lignans (e.g., putative dimeric coniferyl-OH hexoside), generally decreased in abundance most prominently in the stem tissues, with the greatest reductions being in stems with single or multiple KOs of ADT5. Nine glucosinolates, which are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing metabolites synthesized by plants as defense against herbivory and pathogens, were also identified. Glucosinolates derived from homomethione (i.e., glucoiberin, glucohirsutin, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate, and glucohesperalin) generally decreased in abundance in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT, whereas those derived from Trp or Phe showed mixed abundance changes depending on the ADT KO mutant and tissue type. Glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, all derived from Trp, showed increases and decreases depending on the specific ADT KO mutant analyzed. 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin (Trp derived) increased in abundance in most ADT KO mutants leaf samples, and in most of the double/triple/quadruple ADT KO mutants as well as in adt5. Ties between glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids, with lignin being synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway, have been previously documented in the literature, suggesting that there is a strong link between these two pathways. For example, Kim et al. (2015) identified an indole glucosinolate which limits phenylpropanoid accumulation via an inhibitory effect on early steps of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis Various metabolites can often be synthesized or metabolized by one or more isoenzymes contained in distinct plant compartments and/or expressed at different times within a plant’s lifespan. This makes metabolite identification and quantification alone not entirely sufficient to convey key information on specific gene/enzyme targets necessary for full understanding of a system or for bioengineering purposes. For this reason, transcriptomics and proteomics prove to be invaluable for identifying significantly affected pathways, specific gene/enzyme targets, gene regulation events, and tissue specific and/or subcellular compartment-specific target enzyme information. Supplementary Figure 4 shows RNA-Seq counts observed in leaves and stems for each line investigated. In WT plants, the relative order of transcript abundance in stems (where lignin deposition is greatest) was determined to be ADT5 > ADT4 > ADT3 > ADT1 > ADT6. Earlier phylogenetic evaluation showed that ADT3, ADT4 and ADT5 are all part of the same phylogenetic subgroup. It was also determined that these three ADTs correspond to proteins that exclusively utilize arogenate as a substrate (Cho et al., 2007), whereas ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 showed a preference for arogenate but could potentially, albeit less efficiently, use prephenate in synthesizing Phe. Our findings that ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5 were highest in abundance in 4 week old stems was corroborated by similar findings of RT-PCR levels found in 5 week old Arabidopsis stem tissues (Corea et al., 2012c) and separate Northern blot analyses (Rippert et al., 2009) in 4 week old WT Arabidopsis. The latter showed that ADT4 and ADT5 were highest in abundance in stem and root tissues. RNA-Seq data also indicated an increase in ADT expression between ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5, when one of the ADTs in that subgroup was knocked-out. Large increases of ADT5 were observed in the stems when ADT3 and ADT4 were knocked out, showing ∼2 fold and ∼4 fold increases in the adt3 and adt4 knockout lines, respectively. When ADT5 was knocked out, ADT4 was expressed in greater amounts (∼2 fold increase). Overall, these data showed that, especially in stem tissue, ADT mRNA expression between ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5 seemed to be coordinated, as remaining ADTs in the ADT3/ADT4/ADT5 subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. In leaf tissue, only modest effects were observed within this subgroup. To view coverage and relative amounts (i.e., counts) of mRNA fragments identified in each RNA-Seq analysis (in reference to each ADT in leaves or stems), location of the various T-DNA insertions used to produce the KOs and peptides identified from the proteomics analysis, gene product data for each gene were illustrated side by side. The IGV Browser (Robinson et al., 2011; Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013) was used to map out reads to the gene, and using a PNNL developed script9, the peptide data were converted into BED files which could then be used by any genome viewer software. This allowed visualization of proteomics data in relation to the gene alongside the RNA-Seq data. Supplementary Figure 5 displays an example of gene-transcript-peptide visualization comparisons detected in WT and ADT KO lines for ADT5. Comparisons of all other ADTs in all RNA-Seq and proteomics data can be accessed at the MassIVE and ProteomeXchange data repository sites (Accession numbers MSV000081518 and PXD007701, respectively). Read sequences downstream of transcription from T-DNA insertions displayed vastly decreased levels as expected. The proteomics data also showed that few peptides from ADTs were identifiable in the high throughput analysis here, which indicated that the ADTs were likely low in abundance relative to the entire proteome in the leaves. By contrast, in stem tissues, more ADT transcripts and peptides were generally identifiable, supporting the hypothesis that ADT genes, as well as proteins, were relatively higher in abundance in stem tissues compared to leaves. This is likely due to stem tissues needing to biosynthesize lignin in greater relative amounts compared to leaves. We next examined what proportion of each KEGG functional category, on average, contained the most significantly (p-value < 0.05) changed proteins and transcripts in both leaf and stem tissues in all ADT KO lines (Supplementary Figure 6). Categories with the greatest proportion of significantly changed proteins/transcripts were involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, α-linolenic acid metabolism, nitrogen, carotenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism. These findings are in high agreement with the significant changes observed in the metabolomics data (Supplementary Figures 2, 3). Protein and transcript analyses of the putative carotenoid biosynthesis pathway showed a high degree of significantly changed (p-value < 0.05) protein/transcript members (Supplementary Figure 6) when ADT content was reduced. Metabolite measurements of putative carotenoids also showed an almost universal increase in abundance in all ADT KO lines in both leaves and stems (Supplementary Figure 3). Carotenoids function in plants as accessory pigments in plastid membranes and in chloroplasts they are thought to contribute to energy dissipation and can act as protective agents against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Nisar et al., 2015). Carotenoids and their cleavage apocarotenoid products, which may also serve as signaling molecules, are important in assembly of photosynthesis and antenna proteins for photosynthesis and photoprotection (Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010). Protein analysis of photosynthesis and antenna protein biosynthesis pathways showed a relatively high proportion of significantly changed proteins (p-value < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 6A) in ADT KO mutants suggesting that knocking out ADTs in plants also affects photosynthesis. While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe. We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT (Tzin and Galili, 2010), and that ADT KOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp (Corea et al., 2012a). We thus hypothesize that in ADT KO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism (Zhao, 2010). Another phytohormone potentially altered in ADT KO mutants may be jasmonic acid (JA). While we did not specifically detect JA or any other phytohormone in the untargeted metabolomics data, changes in JA precursors may be indicative of potential changes in the downstream phytohormone levels. JA is derived from α-linolenic acid (Weber, 2002) and α-linolenic acid metabolism pathways were highly changed at both the transcript and protein level (Supplementary Figure 6). α-Linolenic acid is not only a precursor to JA, but also aids in photosynthetic thylakoid membrane fluidity (Yashroy, 1987) potentially acting as another contributor to alterations affecting photosynthesis. Other studies indicated that JA levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. Denness et al. (2011) showed that both JA-isoleucine production and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other’s production and influence lignin accumulation. Given there were lower levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate levels in the metabolomes derived from both leaf and stem tissue of ADT KO mutants compared with WT, it may be that ROS is higher in concentration in ADT KO mutants given that there is less ascorbate to scavenge ROS. This along with altered levels of JA could potentially be contributing signals affecting lignin biosynthesis. Ascorbate is also a cofactor for biosynthesis of several other phytohormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid (Pastori et al., 2003). Due to the potential for all these various phytohormones to be altered in amounts when ADT is knocked out, we hypothesize this may be why we see multiple pathway enzymes and metabolite levels affected and not just those directly upstream or downstream of ADT. Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis Figure 2A shows Pearson’s Pairwise log2 abundance dataset correlations between each WT and ADT KO mutant, as compared to every other ADT KO mutant between both proteins and transcripts at the gene product (protein or transcript) and KEGG ortholog (KEGO) enzyme family levels. Transcripts and proteins had an average correlation of 0.394 and 0.369 in leaf and stem data, respectively. Correlations increased, however, when data were further collapsed into KEGO comparisons, with abundance correlations on average being 0.615 and 0.645. Only about 30 and 28% of the transcriptome was detected at the protein level in leaf and stem data (Figure 2B), respectively, whereas KEGO level coverage was about 65%. About 17% of proteins had no detectable transcript, and about 8% of protein KEGOs had no corresponding detectable transcript KEGOs. Overlap percentages between detectable transcripts and proteins also varied due to the KEGG functional category of which they were a member (Figure 2C). Proteins present which no longer have a detectable transcript might represent long-lasting proteins or protein degradation products remaining in the cells after degradation of the corresponding mRNA have occurred. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Proposed correlations of transcript and protein data. (A) Pearson pairwise correlation plots of each log2 abundance ratio data between each ADT KO mutant versus WT dataset compared with all others in both the transcript and protein data. The two leftmost plots are from transcript and protein data, and the last two plots represent collapsed transcript and protein KEGG ortholog data (KEGO) for leaf or stem sample sets. (B) Venn diagram transcripts and proteins, and transcripts and protein KEGOs identified in leaf and stem data. (C) Transcript and protein overlap in all protein and transcript data according to KEGG functional category.To integrate transcript, protein and metabolomics data for a more direct comparison, KEGO values were compared. In this way, since protein and transcript values reflect an overall summed contribution to each enzymatic reactions, their comparisons are likely closer to metabolite abundance changes which themselves are tissue-wide summed values. Z-scores of each log2 abundance ratio transcript-metabolite-protein reaction set are displayed in Figure 3 (leaf data) and Supplementary Figures 7, 8 (stem data), respectively, with corresponding data in Supplementary Tables 2, 3. As shown in the transcript-metabolite-protein heatmaps, there are multiple enzyme KEGOs that can utilize the same substrate, but which could produce different metabolite products. Moreover, sometimes there are multiple KEGOs which carry out the same reaction. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Transcript-metabolite-protein heatmap displaying z-score comparisons of the log2 ratio pairs (ADT KO mutant/wild type, WT) of identified metabolites found to have a corresponding KEGG Ortholog Gene Family (KEGO) member which utilizes that specific metabolite as a substrate, and which were detected in both transcript and proteomics data. Each KEGO is displayed with substrate and product metabolite formed by that KEGO enzyme family. Data is further sorted into clusters that show: (A) Cluster 1–Transcripts, metabolites and proteins which all on average increased or decreased in the ADT KO mutants together compared to WT. (B) Cluster 2–Transcripts decreased, while metabolites and proteins in the ADT KO lines, on average, increased in abundance. (C) Cluster 3–Transcripts and metabolites on average in the ADT KO lines increased, and proteins decreased in abundance compared to WT. (D) Cluster 4–Transcripts and proteins decreased, and metabolites on average increased in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT. In each cluster, entries are further grouped by whether or not Metabolite 1 is a substrate or product in a unidirectional reaction or if it can be utilized in a reversible reaction. Reactions are then ordered from highest average metabolite z-score to lowest metabolite z-score. Red represents metabolites higher in abundance in the ADT KO mutant compared to WT, blue represents metabolites higher in abundance in WT compared to the ADT KO mutant, white represents metabolites unchanged in abundance between WT and the ADT KO mutant, and grey represents constituents not detected. Green squares indicate the highest average KEGO value associated with each detected metabolite. Grey circles represent KEGO reactions where there was only a single known reaction for that given substrate-product reaction. Blue circles represent log2 transcript data that is most highly correlated to log2 metabolite data across ADT KO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between transcripts and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadruple ADT KO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if the z-score values themselves were negative or positive. Orange circles represent log2 protein data that are most highly correlated to log2 metabolite data across ADT KO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between proteins and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadruple ADT KO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if the z-score values themselves were negative or positive.

Alongside z-score values for each KEGO and metabolite, indicators were added to show the reaction that represented the most abundant KEGO for multiple KEGO reactions for a given metabolite. Indicators were also added for which KEGO abundances were most highly correlated to metabolite abundances. Additionally, KEGO reactions were further grouped into categories of whether or not the detected metabolite was either substrate or product in each reaction, or if it could be involved in a reversible reaction (i.e., a metabolite that can serve as both substrate and product). Figure 4 shows distribution of reaction types (unidirectional substrate to product, or reversible) and proportion of each reaction type with KEGOs most correlated to metabolite levels, and KEGOs of greatest abundance (when there are multiple KEGOs for a given metabolite). Interestingly, for the protein KEGO data, where a given reaction type showed highest proportion of the most abundant KEGOs, it then had the least proportion of highest correlations between protein and metabolite abundances (Figures 4B,C). When comparing protein KEGO and metabolite abundance changes, we also observed that the most highly abundant KEGOs were not usually the most correlated with detected metabolite level (Figure 4), i.e., most abundant enzymes did not necessarily produce the most metabolite. Given that metabolite abundances are determined by multiple factors not represented by enzyme abundance alone (i.e., enzyme kinetics, differential degradation rates, and post-translational de/activation of enzymes), this observation is not surprising. Indeed, we can generalize that only ∼45–50% (Figure 4D) of the most abundant KEGOs produced metabolite levels that were most highly correlated to KEGO abundances. Metabolite levels controlled by other KEGOs, with low correlations to metabolite levels, may also be influenced by enzyme kinetics and post-translational activation/deactivation. Figure 4E showed that in Cluster 2 (i.e., transcripts are negatively correlated to proteins and metabolites) of the transcript-metabolite-protein comparisons, the most abundant KEGOs were present in both the leaves and stems. In contrast, Figure 4F had a negative correlation in both the leaves and stems, and in both transcript and protein data. Cluster 1 (i.e., transcript, proteins and metabolites are all positively correlated), and had the highest correlated KEGOs profiles to metabolite profiles. FIGURE 4.

Network Analysis Lignin levels were measured previously in the ADT KO mutant and WT lines by Corea et al. (2012c) A Spearman’s rank correlation between the ADT KO mutant and WT log2 ratios to these lignin levels in 4 week old stems was thus calculated here, with proteins identified with a non-parametric measure of rank correlation (rho) of at least ±0.85. Proteins identified as having a high positive or negative correlation to varying lignin levels across ADT KO mutants were entered into the on-line network analysis tool STRING (see text footnote 7) (Szklarczyk et al., 2017). Protein-protein interactions and associations identified from STRING were then used as input data into the network software Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Z-score data representing abundance changes between ADT KO mutants and WT were overlaid on proteins (nodes), with line thicknesses (edges) of connecting proteins representing potential protein association strength as calculated by STRING analysis. Proteins found to be proximal in the initial Cytoscape network analyses were further manually grouped into KEGG functional categories to highlight relationships between functional categories. Supplementary Figure 9B shows a stem network analysis showing the z-score changes of multiple ADT KO mutant versus WT analyses. As more ADTs (and specifically as ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5) were knocked out and lignin levels decreased (Supplementary Figure 9A), protein abundances deviated further away from WT levels as indicated by nodes appearing darker red or blue in color (Supplementary Figure 9B). Figure 5A specifically shows the network analysis of adt3/4/5 stem data as compared to WT, with the ADT KO mutant having greatest reduction in lignin (cleavable monomeric G + S) levels as measured in 4 week old Arabidopsis stems (Supplementary Figure 9A)–although the lignin level difference between adt3/4/5 and adt3/4/5/6 was not statistically different. Enzymes associated with aromatic amino acid, photosynthesis, carotenoid, and α-linolenic acid metabolism were found to be apparently correlated with reduced lignin levels, and this corroborated well with KEGG functional categories identified as being significantly changed (Supplementary Figure 6A). As our focus was in identifying potential lignin-associated proteins in post-transcriptional regulation, known and predicted interactions between mRNA processing and translation machinery proteins were highlighted (see Figure 5B). Figure 5C displays the heat map of corresponding log2 z-scores of transcript and protein data scrutinized from the mRNA processing and translation machinery for all 8 ADT KO lines (Figure 5B).

    "discussion": "Discussion To begin to put the analyses and discussion below in needed context, it is well known that transcripts and proteins are linked biologically by the central dogma which purports unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins (Crick, 1958). Indeed, comparisons between proteomic and transcriptomic data can highlight which proteins and transcripts have a co-regulatory response (i.e., a high transcript level with a high protein level). The central dogma though is extended in this study to include metabolomics, as many metabolites represent the final product(s) biosynthesized by specific cells/tissues under various environmental conditions or through stresses at specific times during the lifespan of an organism. Protein and Transcript Comparisons In this study, it was found that transcript and protein data between ADT KO mutants correlated well within their own groups (i.e., transcript to transcript or protein to protein comparisons). However, correlations on average were quite low for transcript to protein comparisons, being better but still relatively low for transcript to protein KEGO/gene family comparisons. Venn diagrams which depict the overlap between proteins and transcripts revealed that (a) most transcripts detected did not correspond to a detectable protein, likely due to dynamic range and sampling limits of the proteomics technology compared to the depth of coverage capable with RNA-Seq and (b) not all proteins detected corresponded to a detectable transcript (Figure 2) as could arise from differential mRNA and protein degradation rates. Lack of high correlations though between transcripts and proteins have been found to be typical. In many multi-omics evaluations, across eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, transcripts and proteins are only modestly correlated (Foss et al., 2007; Ghazalpour et al., 2011; Battle et al., 2015; Chick et al., 2016; Hasin et al., 2017). Two examples from plant and animal organisms highlight this point. In a multi-omics investigation of maize, Walley et al. (2016) observed that transcriptome and proteome abundance profiles showed little overlap. In a comparable study of human disease, Hasin et al. (2017) found that transcript levels often exhibited a poor correlation with protein levels, although it was considered that the proteomics data alone was more proximal to the disease mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolite levels did not show a dominant correlation with either transcripts or proteins. These data illustrate the limitations in using only a single omics evaluation to make systems level biological assessments. Comparisons between these omics datasets may thus reveal (a) what transcripts are actually translated and in what copy number, and (b) what metabolomics data help reveal which proteins or protein families are more or less active in producing the observed metabolites. The integrated “omics” analysis, as presented here, provides over-arching and molecule specific information, which is useful for understanding general molecular pathway trends, and for identifying targets of interest for bioengineering purposes or for follow-on analyses. Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources. Such analyses can utilize enzyme relationships derived from hundreds of sources (e.g., yeast two hybrid, co-localization, co-expression, literature text mining, etc.). In turn, this can help provide new insights into interconnections and significant relationships of proteins with known and as-of-yet unknown function. Since our main focus was on proteins potentially related to altered lignin levels (as determined by thioacidolysis analysis), we selected those with greatest positive and negative correlative trends to lignin amounts present in Arabidopsis stems of each line. Centrally located in the lignin correlated protein network data created (Figures 5A,B) were eleven ribosomal subunits that correlated with reduced lignin levels. This raised the possibility that lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or “ribocode” (Mauro and Edelman, 2002; Xue and Barna, 2012). That is, lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA. Recent studies have documented evidence for ribocodes, the concept of which suggests differential, temporal and spatial presence of specific ribosomal subunits which preferentially translate specific mRNAs, thus representing regulation at translation. Other observations of possible plant ribocodes include phosphate and Fe-deficiency studies by Rodríguez-Celma et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013), who both showed evidence for remodeled translational machinery in response to environmental signals in Arabidopsis. Liu et al. (2012) also reported that translational control was mRNA abundance independent, concluding that mRNA levels had less effect on gene activity than translational control mechanisms in Arabidopsis. Other potential targets of lignin biosynthesis regulation identified included those associated with purine metabolism, the spliceosome, RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance and general mRNA processing proteins. Post-translational modifications, protein transport, and targeting mechanisms also appeared correlated with varying lignin levels. Additionally, post-translational related protein processing involving the endoplasmic reticulum was identified, as well as ubiquitin proteolysis, phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and phosphatase proteins which may be connected to important processes related to lignin biosynthesis. In our analysis as to what connects the spliceosome, which edits native mRNA into mature translatable mRNA and the ribosomal subunits, was the spliceosome protein DRH1 (At3g01540) to the large ribosomal subunit RPL2.1 (ATCG00830) (Figure 5B). DRH1 is a ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase and polynucleotide-dependent ATPase (Okanami et al., 1998). Export of poly(A)(+) RNA has been shown to be greatly blocked in DRH1 mutants (Du et al., 2016). Presence or absence of this helicase could thus serve as a level of regulation, blocking or allowing export of mRNA into the cytosol. Connected to the identified spliceosome proteins was SAP18 (Song and Galbraith, 2006). In plants, this functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with ethylene-responsive element binding factors to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of stress. A SAP18 loss of function mutant produces a plant both more susceptible to salt and impaired in chlorophyll synthesis. These data indicate what we generally observed with our multi-omics data, namely that: (a) despite any significant presence of mRNA, there are additional factors which may prevent proper processing of mRNA into mature translatable form; (b) there are also other factors which may prevent any mRNA present from ever leaving the nucleus to be translated. Together, these data also highlight the importance of proteomics to illuminate what protein products are actually present and which are potentially functional. Furthermore, the vast majority of lignin biosynthesis regulation research thus far has focused on genes and transcriptional control (Nakano et al., 2015). From this body of knowledge, we know that lignin biosynthesis is influenced by a series of transcription factors, such as NAC master switches, which can activate or repress an array of other downstream transcription factors (e.g., MYBs). What is lesser known are what additional post-transcriptional controls of lignin or other phenylpropanoids exist. Due to our discovery that modulating ADTs produces differential lignin contents in Arabidopsis, the opportunity was presented where–through this multi-omics study–we could investigate molecular profiles with step-wise decreases or increases in lockstep to varying lignin levels. These results of our investigation suggest that there are potentially multiple processes, phytohormones and layers of regulation involved in lignin biosynthesis or in response to decreased carbon flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway. Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected by ADT composition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) (Stapleton and Walbot, 1994; Landry et al., 1995; Mazza et al., 2000; Clé et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2014), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids. Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants. Potential of a Lignin Regulating “Ribocode” Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These “specialized ribosomes” suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done by Williams and Sussex (1995), it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis were mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes (Ni and Snyder, 2001; Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs (Draptchinskaia et al., 1999). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs (Slavov et al., 2015). In our study, we used the STRING (see text footnote 7) algorithm to identify connections/associations between lignin profile correlated proteins. Our results returned interactions between nucleus and plastid proteins (e.g., RPL2.1 and DRH1). While there is currently no direct evidence in Arabidopsis that this association exists, there is growing documentation of interactions between homologs of these proteins in other organisms (e.g., humans, yeast, Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori) (Garcia-Gomez et al., 2011; Havugimana et al., 2012). Additional studies, however, would need to be performed to verify the actual association, if any, between eukaryotic and plastid translation-associated proteins in Arabidopsis. These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin “ribocode.”",

Copyright notice ID: 8185232 PMID: 34113365 Abstract Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants. Keywords: lignin, arogenate dehydratases, multi-omics, network analysis, Arabidopsis, ribocodeIntroduction Arogenate is an important branch-point to either tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe) in vascular plants, whose formation from arogenate (Agn) is catalyzed by arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), respectively (Figure 1). The Phe so formed can then be incorporated into either proteins or massively utilized in the phenylpropanoid pathway to produce lignins, as well as other related metabolites (e.g., lignans, allyl/propenyl phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthocyanins) depending upon the species. In our earlier studies, homozygous single and multiple Arabidopsis ADT knock-out (KO) lines with homologous T-DNA insertion mutations were obtained, with the most extreme phenotypes showing an ∼70% reduction in lignin content as compared to wild type (WT) plants (Corea et al., 2012a, b, c). Phenotypes of the former also displayed prostrate stems and lowest stem dry weights/heights. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Simplified metabolic pathways linking photosynthesis, carbon fixation and lignin biosynthesis, as well as placement of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) between the chorismate-shikimate, aromatic amino acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways in vascular plant systems. Selected metabolites are illustrated along with enzymes depicted by arrows.Differentially varying lignin levels as above, obtained through systematic manipulation of the 6-membered Arabidopsis ADT gene family (ADT1, At1g11790; ADT2, At3g07630; ADT3, At2g27820; ADT4, At3g44720; ADT5, At5g22630, and ADT6, At1g08250), thus offered the opportunity to investigate the holistic nature of such perturbations on overall Arabidopsis systems biology. To do this, we carried out multi-omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analyses of leaf and stem tissues of single (adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, and adt6), double, triple and quadruple (adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6) KO mutant and WT lines, at 4 weeks of growth/development. In this study, multi-omics “normalization” strategies were employed to enable direct integration and visualization of the disparate “omics” datasets of related transcripts, proteins and metabolites, thereby allowing for greater understanding, confidence and validation of resulting systemic biological perturbations observed. Network analysis (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) was also used to (a) identify enzymes or processes most highly correlated to different lignin levels, and (b) reveal potentially novel enzymes or processes related with lignin level regulation and biosynthesis. This analysis resulted in our provisionally deducing novel transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulatory processes, when carbon flux was reduced in the phenylpropanoid pathway and which profoundly affected lignin deposition. Many proteins identified in our network analysis have not been reported as potentially linked to lignin biosynthesis regulation. For example, several ribosome subunits with high correlations to lignin level profiles were identified, suggesting the possible presence of a “ribocode.” These proteins, as well as other ribosome-interacting mRNA processing proteins detected in our network analysis, indicate that vascular plant lignin levels are not only controlled at the point of transcription but work together with modulating factors at a post-transcriptional and translational level as described below.Materials and Methods Chemicals For metabolomics analyses, OptimaTM grade water, acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, United States). Authentic standards used for secondary metabolite metabolomics are described in Höhner et al. (2018). For proteomics and RNA-Seq sample preparation, nanopure water was used and all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States) and were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted. Arabidopsis T-DNA Knock Out (KO) Insertion Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Columbia) T-DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL)1. Individual ADT KO mutant lines were created in homozygous form, with individual lines crossed to ultimately provide double, triple, and quadruple homozygous ADT KO mutants (Corea et al., 2012c).Plant Growth and Harvesting Conditions A. thaliana WT (Columbia) and KO mutant lines were grown in Institute of Biological Chemistry (Washington State University) greenhouses with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 27–28°C/24–26°C, respectively. Nitrogen-based fertilizer (200 ppm) was added five times a week. Plants were harvested at 4 weeks after planting with rosette leaf and stem tissues individually collected and immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2. Each sample was stored at −80°C until further analysis.Primary Metabolite Derivatization Nine individual plants of each line were frozen in liquid N2 and freeze-dried. Dry plant tissues were ground into fine powders using a tissue-lyzer II (Qiagen, Germany) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz at −80°C. Powdered freeze-dried Arabidopsis leaves or stems (20 mg) were individually suspended in 500 μL of methanol:2-iso-propanol:water (5:2:2, v/v/v). After adding 13C labeled ribitol standard (1.5 μg), each material was extracted by vortexing for 10 min, followed by sonication for 5 min. Extracts were individually centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, with supernatants transferred to a new vial and subsequently dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually re-suspended in water:acetonitrile (500 μL, 1:1 v/v), and re-extracted by sequential vortexing and sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min with supernatants then removed and dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually suspended in O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (40 mg mL–1 in pyridine, 5 μL, Sigma) and incubated for 90 min at 30°C at 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer). Subsequently, samples were individually derivatized with MSTFA (45 μL) with 1% TMCS (Thermo-Pierce) for 30 min at 37°C and 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer).Primary Metabolite Analysis Using Gas Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Analyses were performed using a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO) equipped with a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and an Agilent 7890A oven. Derivatization products were separated on a (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. ×0.25 μm) Rxi®-5Sil column (Restek) with an IntegraGuard® pre-column using ultrapure He at a constant flow of 1 mL min–1 as carrier gas. The linear thermal gradient started with 1 min at 50°C, followed by a ramp to 330°C at 20°C min–1. Final temperature was held for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions and mass spectra were collected at 17 spectra s–1. The injection port was held at 250°C, and an aliquot of the sample (1 μL) was injected.GC-MS Data Processing Peak annotation employed the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind et al., 2009), where an identity score cutoff of 600 was used. Peak alignment and mass spectra comparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare feature of the ChromaTOF® software (LECO). Surrogate standard 13C ribitol and original tissue weight were used for normalization.Secondary Metabolomic Analysis Using Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried material from each individual plant tissue (10 mg) as described (Lu et al., 2017) in 200 μL of methanol:water (70:30, v/v) containing naringenin (Aldrich) as an internal standard. Samples were vortexed, sonicated for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Supernatants were individually stored at −80°C until analysis. Samples were analyzed using a Waters AcquityTM Ultra Performance LC system as described in Lu et al. (2017) with the following modifications: Liquid chromatography was performed using a 100 × 2.1 mm i.d. (1.7 μm particle size) UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters). Masses of eluted compounds were detected using an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the negative ion mode with capillary voltage at 2.2 kV; cone voltage at 20 eV; collision energy at 6 eV and at 30 eV. Chromatograms and spectra were inspected, and raw data files and metabolite assignments were determined as described previously (Lu et al., 2017). Before statistical analysis, feature integration results were normalized to internal standard naringenin (M271T1197_1, retention time 1197 s and m/z (average) 271.0609 and calculated 271.0606, for C15H11O5). Many metabolites were unambiguously identified by comparison with retention times, UV spectra and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of authentic standard compounds. Other metabolites were putatively annotated based on accurate mass, isotopic pattern recognition, and MS/MS spectra. These were searched in both the literature and publicly available mass spectral databases [i.e., Metlin, ReSpect2, Massbank3, and HMDB4 ].RNA Extraction and Illumina HiSeq Analysis For each sample, liquid nitrogen frozen tissue sample (100 mg) was ground using a mortar and pestle cooled in presence of liquid nitrogen. A SpectrumTM Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was employed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control was performed on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop with all 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm readings above 1.8. Illumina TruSeq RNA libraries were constructed per the manufacturer’s protocol, with quality evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Six lanes were multiplexed with five samples per lane in the single ended, 50 bp configuration. A mean of 41 M reads passing quality filters was obtained for each sample (min. 31 M, max. 50 M). Cluster generation used the cBot SR Cluster Gen Kit (V3) and the flow cell used was SR FC Information (V3).RNA-Seq Data Workup CyVerse (formerly iPlant Collaborative)5 (Goff et al., 2011), was used for analysis and evaluation of the HiSeq data. Once all FASTQ files produced from the Illumina sequencing were uploaded into the Discovery Environment (DE), the TopHat2-SE App, which comprised TopHat 2.0.9 and Bowtie 2.1.0, was used to align the RNA-Seq reads to the A. thaliana TAIR10 genome using the short read aligner Bowtie which is capable of analyzing the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons. The reference genome and reference annotations used the A. thaliana TAIR10 genome (A. thaliana Ensembl 19). Default analysis options were used with the exception of the FASTQ quality scale of Illumina 1.3-1.8 (PHRED64). Anchor length: 8; Maximum number of mismatches that can appear in the anchor region of spliced alignment: 0; The minimum intron length: 70; the maximum intron length: 50000; Minimum isoform fraction: 0.15; Maximum number of alignments to be allowed: 20; Minimum intron length that may be found during split-segment (default) search: 50; Maximum intron length that may be found during split-segment (default) search: 500000; Number of mismatches allowed in each segment alignment for reads mapped independently: 2; Minimum length of read segments: 20. Next, Cufflinks2 (an interface for Cufflinks version 2.1.1) located in the DE of CyVerse was used to link short read RNA-Seq alignments found from the TopHat analysis to the reference annotations from the TAIR10 genome. Cufflinks identified sequences that did not align with the annotated genome and labels them with novel identifiers. Default settings were used in Cufflinks. These parameters included abundance estimation options of: Number of importance for samples generated for each locus: 1000; Number of iterations allowed during MLE (maximum-likelihood estimates) of abundances: 5000; Prefix for transcripts in reported GTF (General Transfer Format): Cuff; Minimum isoform fraction: 0.1; Pre-mRNA fraction: 0.1; Maximum intron length: 300000; Alpha value for the binomial test used during false positive spliced alignment filtration: 0.001; Small anchor fraction: 0.09; Minimum fragments per transfrag: 10; The number of bp allowed to enter the intron of a transcript when determining if a read or another transcript is map-able with it: 8; Maximum genomic length allowed for a given bundle: 3500000; Minimum intron length: 50; Minimum average coverage required to attempt 3′ trimming: 10; The fraction of average coverage below which to trim the 3′ end of an assembled transcript: 0.1. Next, the HTSeq-with-BAM-input app in the CyVerse site was used to produce count data from the BAM files using default parameter values.Protein Extraction and Digestion Ice cold 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol (10 mL) and β-mercaptoethanol (250 μL) were added to each pulverized powder sample (ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle) followed by vigorous shaking for 15 s. For stem tissues, a Polytron homogenizer was used for about 30 s at a speed of 30 to further homogenize them. Samples were individually placed in a −20°C freezer for 2 h, and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4°C. Each supernatant was next removed and discarded. The above addition of ammonium acetate/methanol solution and centrifugation steps were repeated four more times to remove metabolites and lipids from each sample. Excess methanol was removed by drying the pellets gently under a flow of nitrogen for ∼2 min. A protein solubilization solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 5 mM of neutralized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Bond-Breaker, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, United States) was added to each sample to completely cover each pellet, plus 500 μL more. Samples were then individually incubated at 4°C overnight. Debris from each was physically mixed into solution with a pipette tip and the slurry sonicated in a Hielscher UTR200 ultrasonic processor for 10–20 s at 100% amplitude. Protein slurries were next individually incubated at 60°C for 30 min, with samples vortexed and sonicated in the sonoreactor again for about 30 s. Each sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4°C. A Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States), using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard, was next conducted on individual supernatants to estimate protein contents. Afterward, denatured samples were diluted tenfold with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). CaCl2 was added to a concentration of 2 mM and trypsin (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) was added at a trypsin:sample ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Samples were individually digested overnight at 37°C and then alkylated with chloroacetamide at a concentration of 5 mM in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Peptides from each treatment were desalted with an SCX SPE (SUPELCO Supelclean) using 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0), 25% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, to remove CHAPS, and then a 80:15:5 (v/v/v) methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M) was used to elute peptides. C-18 SPE columns (SUPELCO Discovery) were employed to remove ammonium salts, using a 0.1% TFA (v/v) in nanopure water to wash the peptides and a 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile:water with 0.1% (v/v) TFA solvent to elute peptides. Peptides were quantified using a BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States) with a BSA standard.iTRAQ Peptide Labeling Peptides were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQ (AB Sciex, Redwood City, CA, United States) reagents: Each peptide sample (30 μg) was placed in a new tube and dried down. Dissolution buffer (iTRAQ buffer kit, 13 μL) was added to each sample, these being vortexed into solution and centrifuged briefly to draw sample to the bottom of each tube. iTRAQ reagent (10 μL) was diluted further with isopropanol (35 μL), and this was added to each sample. Each reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (200 μL) added to quench each reaction. After 1 h, contents from all iTRAQ channel reactions were added to one tube and then the sample was vortexed and dried down in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator.Offline Fractionation of Peptides and Preparation of Proteome Samples Labeled peptides were separated using an off-line high pH (pH 10) reversed-phase (RP) separation with a Waters XBridge C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) and a guard column (4.6 mm × 20 mm) using an Agilent 1200 HPLC System. Each sample loaded onto the C18 column was washed for 15 min with Solvent A [10 mM ammonium formate, adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M)]. The gradient started with a linear increase of 0% Solvent B [10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v)] to: 5% Solvent B over 10 min, 45% Solvent B over 65 min, and then to 100% Solvent B over 15 min. Solvent B was held at 100% for 10 min, and then this was changed to 100% Solvent A, this being held for 20 min to recondition the column. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1. A total of 48 fractions were collected for each sample into a 96 well plate throughout the above LC gradient. The high pH RP fractions were then combined into 12 fractions using the concatenation strategy previously reported (Wang et al., 2011). Peptide fractions were dried down and re-suspended in nanopure water at a concentration of 75 ng μL–1 for mass spectrometry analysis using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos MS (Thermo Scientific) system as described below.Mass-Spectrometry Based Analysis of Peptide Samples The LC system was custom built using two Agilent 1200 nanoflow pumps and one Agilent 1200 cap pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States), various Valco valves (Valco Instruments Co., Houston, TX, United States), and a PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC, United States). Full automation was made possible by custom software that allows for parallel event coordination and therefore near 100% MS duty cycle through use of two trapping and analytical columns. Reversed-phase columns were prepared in-house by slurry packing 3 μm Jupiter C18 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, United States) into 40 cm × 360 μm o.d. ×75 μm i.d. fused silica (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ, United States) using a 1-cm sol-gel frit for media retention (Maiolica et al., 2005). Trapping columns were prepared similarly by slurry packing 5-μm Jupiter C18 into a 4-cm length of 150 μm i.d. fused silica and fritted on both ends. Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) operated at 300 nL–1 min with a linear gradient profile as follows (min:%B): 0:5, 2:8, 20:12, 75:35, 97:60, 100: 85. Sample injections (5 μL) were trapped and washed on the trapping columns at 3 μL min–1 for 20 min prior to alignment with analytical columns. Data acquisition lagged the gradient start and end times by 15 min to account for column dead volume that allowed for the tightest overlap possible in a two-column operation. The two-column operation also allowed for columns to be “washed” (shortened gradients) and re-generated off-line without any cost to duty cycle. The LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode acquiring higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) scans (R = 7,500, 5 × 104 target ions) after each full MS scan (R = 30,000, 3 × 106 target ions) for the top ten most abundant ions within the mass range of 300 to 1,800 m/z. An isolation window of 2.5 Thomson units (Th) was used to isolate ions prior to HCD. All HCD scans used normalized collision energy of 45 and maximum injection time of 1000 ms. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 60 s and charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned and singly charged ions.Peptide Identification and Quantification For peptide identification, MS/MS spectra were searched against a decoy A. thaliana protein TAIR106 database using the algorithm SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994). Search parameters included: no enzyme specificity for proteome data and trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleaves, ±50 ppm precursor mass tolerance, ±0.05 Da product mass tolerance, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines and iTRAQ labeling of lysines and peptide N-termini as fixed modifications. Allowed variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and proline. MS-GF (Kim et al., 2008) spectra probability values were also calculated for peptides identified from SEQUEST searches. Measured mass accuracy and MS-GF spectra probability were used to filter identified peptides to <0.4% false discovery rate (FDR) at spectrum level and <1% FDR at the peptide level using the decoy approach. iTRAQ reporter ions were extracted using the MASIC software (Monroe et al., 2008) with a 10 ppm mass tolerance for each expected iTRAQ reporter ion as determined from each MS/MS spectrum. Protein and Transcript Relative Fold-change, Z-score and P-value Determinations For the protein data, relative abundances of peptides were determined using iTRAQ reporter ion intensity ratios from each MS/MS spectrum. Individual peptide intensity values were determined by dividing the base peak intensity by the relative ratio associated with each reporter ion. Each iTRAQ experiment references a pool of peptides so that all experiments could be linked. All peptide data were combined into a single data table and were transformed to a log2 value, following which each data row of each iTRAQ experiment was shifted so that the reference pool value in each iTRAQ experiment was equal. Then each column of data representing each channel of each iTRAQ experiment was mean centered. All peptide values were next transformed to undo the log2, by calculating 2 to the power of each data point. Peptide abundance values were then separated into two datasets, one of peptides unique to a single protein and peptides which are shared between two or more proteins. Peptides were rolled up to a protein value by summing the peptides that belong to each protein in each dataset. Where the same protein was calculated in both datasets, only one protein value was selected in a final protein rollup table with the protein value from the unique peptide rollup given preference if identified in all channels. Individual protein roll-up calculations from the unique or shared peptide table were designated in the final protein roll-up table. KEGG Orthology protein family groups (KEGOs) were also determined for both protein and transcript data. Protein KEGOs were calculated by summing all unique peptide values found within a KEGO. Transcript KEGOs were calculated by summing all transcript count data within a like KEGO. All protein, transcript and KEGO values were converted to a log2 value. Log2 values below 2 in all protein datasets were removed as these primarily represent noise signals which interfere with z-score calculations. All replicates were averaged, and MA plots were constructed for each comparison between the average value of each WT and mutant line. All fold change pairs analyzed in MA plots, were combined into a single dataset and the values obtained in the A axis were ranked from lowest to highest. A sliding window which represented 10% of the total number of data point was used to calculate the z-score value along the A axis for each data point (in the MA plot). Z-score (z = x-μ/σ = (datapoint–median)/standard deviation). This standardized the log2 fold change distribution among all data points (low and high abundance alike). From the normal distribution of all log2 fold changes, a p-value was calculated for each log2 fold change comparison using the normsdist function in Excel.Network Analysis All proteins with a high Spearman rank correlation (rho > 0.85) to the monomeric guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignin-derived moieties, and which had a z-score ratio value no more than ±0.5 in the adt1 versus WT analysis, were identified in WT and adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5, adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6 mutants, and were entered into the STRING network analysis algorithm7 (Szklarczyk et al., 2017) searching against the A. thaliana database. STRING returned protein-protein associations, type of association, and strength of association. Known interactions from either curated databases or which were experimentally determined were considered, along with predicted interactions from gene fusion, gene co-occurrence, gene neighborhood experiments, as well as from text mining, co-expression datasets and protein homology datasets. Node interactions were selected only if STRING returned a minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher and for nodes with at least one interaction. These data were then exported into an interaction table, this then being made into a SIF document and uploaded into Cytoscape 3.4.0 (Smoot et al., 2011). In Cytoscape, the layout attribute Organic was selected under yFiles Layout. Nodes in close proximity were further clustered together manually based on either like KEGG or a gene ortholog (GO) term functional category if no KEGG category existed. Nodes were represented by rectangles colored by a red-blue color scheme to represent z-scores of log2 ratios (ADT KO mutant/WT), where red represents proteins higher in abundance in ADT KO mutants compared to WT, white symbolizes no change, and blue represents proteins higher in abundance in WT compared to ADT KO mutants. The thickness of the edge represents strength of relationship between nodes/proteins, as determined by the final combined score output of STRING. A more focused STRING analysis was carried out just on ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA processing involved proteins to view the putative specific connections. Only associations related to known and predicted interactions were considered. A minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher was used for nodes with at least one interaction.Results A multi-omics evaluation of Arabidopsis ADT KO mutant lines (compared to WT plants) was conducted at 4 weeks of growth/development, when the plants had fully developed rosette leaves and had stems about 10–20 cm high (∼1/3 height at maturity). For both tissue types, full RNA-Seq transcriptomics, iTRAQ 8-plex multiplexing proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS, together with primary (GC-MS) and secondary (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed. Data interrogation resulted in confident detection (1% FDR) of 27,181 transcripts, 8,672 proteins, together with 132 primary and 30 secondary metabolites. Normalization of Expression Data for Multi-Omics Integration Each biomolecular class (i.e., transcripts, proteins, and metabolites) was measured using disparate workflows. Since only a few replicate analyses were feasible, as is typical for RNA-Seq and proteome analysis, variance estimations were offset by “borrowing” information from genes or proteins across the entire analysis (Subramaniam and Hsiao, 2012). The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM (Tusher et al., 2001), limma (Ritchie et al., 2015), and VAMPIRE (Hsiao et al., 2005)]. We applied this approach to log2 fold change transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data between each ADT KO mutant and WT analysis. Data were first processed as MA-plots (Dudoit et al., 2002; Labbe and Dudoit, 2012) (Supplementary Figure 1), an approach that distributes log2 fold change data (M = y-axis) according to average abundance (A = x-axis) of the two measurements being compared. Log2 fold change calculations for any type of expression data (gene/protein/metabolite) typically form a normal distribution, with subsequent utilization of localized data (or a sliding window of log2 fold change data with similar abundances) enabling calculation of more accurate z-scores and p-values for significance estimations. Resulting z-score calculations then allowed for normalization of data into units of standard deviation (away from an average or zero-fold change value). This normalization then permits integration of datasets obtained on disparate platforms (i.e., Illumina sequencing, mass spectrometry) to be compared directly.Metabolomics Analysis Metabolite profiles represent the ultimate molecular phenotypic indicator of an organism at a specific growth/developmental stage. Metabolites often function as cofactors, energy sources, signaling molecules, polymer precursors (e.g., to cellulose, lignins, proteins, DNA), as well as defense, attractant and effector molecules. In the context of plant bioengineering, metabolomic analyses provide the ultimate validation as to which metabolites are increased or decreased in quantity in response to a genetic change or other perturbation. Here we used two mass spectrometric methods to evaluate the differences between each ADT KO mutant and WT in terms of both primary and secondary metabolism. Supplementary Figures 2, 3 show heat maps displaying z-scores of log2 fold changes between ADT KO mutants and WT for the metabolites identified by GC-MS (i.e., primary metabolites) and LC-MS (i.e., secondary metabolites), respectively. Data were grouped by functional categories, as defined by KEGG8 (Kanehisa et al., 2017), when available. Z-score values pertaining to Supplementary Figures 2, 3 are found in Supplementary Table 1. The GC-MS results (Supplementary Figure 2) are shown as a heat map displaying z-score of the log2 fold change values of each metabolite found in each ADT KO mutant compared to WT. The largest primary metabolite classes identified were related to carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids. Fold-changes found in the carbohydrate class included on average decreases in ascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 2.3 in stem) and dehydroascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 1.5 in stem). While not detected in leaf tissue, melibiose (3.2 fold), and xylitol (2.3 fold) were lower in abundance in the stems. In both leaf and stem tissues, the most significant change of all metabolites identified from GC-MS data was that of an increase in sorbitol (5.9 fold in leaf, 152 fold in stem). Knocking out even a single ADT isoform in Arabidopsis has profound effects on sorbitol biosynthesis, and perhaps on a plant-wide level. Jain et al. (2010) reported that treatment of maize seedlings with increased concentrations of sorbitol (a) decreased total chlorophyll, protein and RNA contents, while increasing proline levels and nitrate reductase activity; and (b) induced a stress response that overall inhibited maize growth. By producing so much sorbitol in vivo, ADT KO mutants may too be experiencing changes in chlorophyll, protein and RNA levels. Moreover, these plant lines may also be under increased levels of stress relative to WT plants. Glycolic acid (2.1 fold in leaf and 2.3 fold in stem) additionally was found to be increased in ADT KO mutants versus WT. Glycolic acid is produced when ribulose bisphosphate (RuBisCo) fixes O2 instead of CO2. The increased presence of glycolic acid in both leaf and stem tissues suggests increased photorespiration pathway utilization, which results in a release of CO2 back to the atmosphere. In stem tissue, other carbohydrates such as D-glyceric acid (2.8 fold), 6-deoxy-D-glucose (10.1 fold), and fructose-6-phosphate (4.1 fold) also had higher levels in ADT KO lines versus WT, whereas significantly increased levels of D-glucoheptose (36.1 fold), allose (4.0 fold), gluconic lactone (3.5 fold), sorbose (2.5 fold), threonic acid (7.3 fold), and glucose-1-phosphate (3.9 fold) were observed in leaves. Amino acids with the most increased levels in the ADT KO mutants versus WT stem tissues included allothreonine (4.2 fold), alanine (2.3 fold), and glutamate (2.2 fold). By contrast, decreases in the ADT KO lines were found for oxoproline (2.4 fold) in the stems. Interestingly, shikimate which is a key metabolite located in the aromatic amino acid/shikimate chorismate pathways upstream of ADT, was, on average, increased (2.6 fold) in ADT KO mutant leaves, but decreased (8.3 fold) in abundance in stem tissues. The LC-MS metabolomics analysis of hydro-alcoholic extracts of leaves and stems led to the detection of numerous important secondary metabolites (Supplementary Figure 3). This approach was chosen based on previous knowledge of important and characteristic metabolites produced by A. thaliana, which include flavonoids, phenylpropanoids (e.g., sinapate esters, lignans) and glucosinolates. We found that putative galactolipids and carotenoids generally increased in abundance in both tissues, whereas most of the identified flavonoids, 1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl sinapate, 5-hydroxyferuloyl malate and lignans (e.g., putative dimeric coniferyl-OH hexoside), generally decreased in abundance most prominently in the stem tissues, with the greatest reductions being in stems with single or multiple KOs of ADT5. Nine glucosinolates, which are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing metabolites synthesized by plants as defense against herbivory and pathogens, were also identified. Glucosinolates derived from homomethione (i.e., glucoiberin, glucohirsutin, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate, and glucohesperalin) generally decreased in abundance in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT, whereas those derived from Trp or Phe showed mixed abundance changes depending on the ADT KO mutant and tissue type. Glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, all derived from Trp, showed increases and decreases depending on the specific ADT KO mutant analyzed. 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin (Trp derived) increased in abundance in most ADT KO mutants leaf samples, and in most of the double/triple/quadruple ADT KO mutants as well as in adt5. Ties between glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids, with lignin being synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway, have been previously documented in the literature, suggesting that there is a strong link between these two pathways. For example, Kim et al. (2015) identified an indole glucosinolate which limits phenylpropanoid accumulation via an inhibitory effect on early steps of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis Various metabolites can often be synthesized or metabolized by one or more isoenzymes contained in distinct plant compartments and/or expressed at different times within a plant’s lifespan. This makes metabolite identification and quantification alone not entirely sufficient to convey key information on specific gene/enzyme targets necessary for full understanding of a system or for bioengineering purposes. For this reason, transcriptomics and proteomics prove to be invaluable for identifying significantly affected pathways, specific gene/enzyme targets, gene regulation events, and tissue specific and/or subcellular compartment-specific target enzyme information. Supplementary Figure 4 shows RNA-Seq counts observed in leaves and stems for each line investigated. In WT plants, the relative order of transcript abundance in stems (where lignin deposition is greatest) was determined to be ADT5 > ADT4 > ADT3 > ADT1 > ADT6. Earlier phylogenetic evaluation showed that ADT3, ADT4 and ADT5 are all part of the same phylogenetic subgroup. It was also determined that these three ADTs correspond to proteins that exclusively utilize arogenate as a substrate (Cho et al., 2007), whereas ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 showed a preference for arogenate but could potentially, albeit less efficiently, use prephenate in synthesizing Phe. Our findings that ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5 were highest in abundance in 4 week old stems was corroborated by similar findings of RT-PCR levels found in 5 week old Arabidopsis stem tissues (Corea et al., 2012c) and separate Northern blot analyses (Rippert et al., 2009) in 4 week old WT Arabidopsis. The latter showed that ADT4 and ADT5 were highest in abundance in stem and root tissues. RNA-Seq data also indicated an increase in ADT expression between ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5, when one of the ADTs in that subgroup was knocked-out. Large increases of ADT5 were observed in the stems when ADT3 and ADT4 were knocked out, showing ∼2 fold and ∼4 fold increases in the adt3 and adt4 knockout lines, respectively. When ADT5 was knocked out, ADT4 was expressed in greater amounts (∼2 fold increase). Overall, these data showed that, especially in stem tissue, ADT mRNA expression between ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5 seemed to be coordinated, as remaining ADTs in the ADT3/ADT4/ADT5 subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. In leaf tissue, only modest effects were observed within this subgroup. To view coverage and relative amounts (i.e., counts) of mRNA fragments identified in each RNA-Seq analysis (in reference to each ADT in leaves or stems), location of the various T-DNA insertions used to produce the KOs and peptides identified from the proteomics analysis, gene product data for each gene were illustrated side by side. The IGV Browser (Robinson et al., 2011; Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013) was used to map out reads to the gene, and using a PNNL developed script9, the peptide data were converted into BED files which could then be used by any genome viewer software. This allowed visualization of proteomics data in relation to the gene alongside the RNA-Seq data. Supplementary Figure 5 displays an example of gene-transcript-peptide visualization comparisons detected in WT and ADT KO lines for ADT5. Comparisons of all other ADTs in all RNA-Seq and proteomics data can be accessed at the MassIVE and ProteomeXchange data repository sites (Accession numbers MSV000081518 and PXD007701, respectively). Read sequences downstream of transcription from T-DNA insertions displayed vastly decreased levels as expected. The proteomics data also showed that few peptides from ADTs were identifiable in the high throughput analysis here, which indicated that the ADTs were likely low in abundance relative to the entire proteome in the leaves. By contrast, in stem tissues, more ADT transcripts and peptides were generally identifiable, supporting the hypothesis that ADT genes, as well as proteins, were relatively higher in abundance in stem tissues compared to leaves. This is likely due to stem tissues needing to biosynthesize lignin in greater relative amounts compared to leaves. We next examined what proportion of each KEGG functional category, on average, contained the most significantly (p-value < 0.05) changed proteins and transcripts in both leaf and stem tissues in all ADT KO lines (Supplementary Figure 6). Categories with the greatest proportion of significantly changed proteins/transcripts were involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, α-linolenic acid metabolism, nitrogen, carotenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism. These findings are in high agreement with the significant changes observed in the metabolomics data (Supplementary Figures 2, 3). Protein and transcript analyses of the putative carotenoid biosynthesis pathway showed a high degree of significantly changed (p-value < 0.05) protein/transcript members (Supplementary Figure 6) when ADT content was reduced. Metabolite measurements of putative carotenoids also showed an almost universal increase in abundance in all ADT KO lines in both leaves and stems (Supplementary Figure 3). Carotenoids function in plants as accessory pigments in plastid membranes and in chloroplasts they are thought to contribute to energy dissipation and can act as protective agents against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Nisar et al., 2015). Carotenoids and their cleavage apocarotenoid products, which may also serve as signaling molecules, are important in assembly of photosynthesis and antenna proteins for photosynthesis and photoprotection (Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010). Protein analysis of photosynthesis and antenna protein biosynthesis pathways showed a relatively high proportion of significantly changed proteins (p-value < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 6A) in ADT KO mutants suggesting that knocking out ADTs in plants also affects photosynthesis. While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe. We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT (Tzin and Galili, 2010), and that ADT KOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp (Corea et al., 2012a). We thus hypothesize that in ADT KO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism (Zhao, 2010). Another phytohormone potentially altered in ADT KO mutants may be jasmonic acid (JA). While we did not specifically detect JA or any other phytohormone in the untargeted metabolomics data, changes in JA precursors may be indicative of potential changes in the downstream phytohormone levels. JA is derived from α-linolenic acid (Weber, 2002) and α-linolenic acid metabolism pathways were highly changed at both the transcript and protein level (Supplementary Figure 6). α-Linolenic acid is not only a precursor to JA, but also aids in photosynthetic thylakoid membrane fluidity (Yashroy, 1987) potentially acting as another contributor to alterations affecting photosynthesis. Other studies indicated that JA levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. Denness et al. (2011) showed that both JA-isoleucine production and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other’s production and influence lignin accumulation. Given there were lower levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate levels in the metabolomes derived from both leaf and stem tissue of ADT KO mutants compared with WT, it may be that ROS is higher in concentration in ADT KO mutants given that there is less ascorbate to scavenge ROS. This along with altered levels of JA could potentially be contributing signals affecting lignin biosynthesis. Ascorbate is also a cofactor for biosynthesis of several other phytohormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid (Pastori et al., 2003). Due to the potential for all these various phytohormones to be altered in amounts when ADT is knocked out, we hypothesize this may be why we see multiple pathway enzymes and metabolite levels affected and not just those directly upstream or downstream of ADT.Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis Figure 2A shows Pearson’s Pairwise log2 abundance dataset correlations between each WT and ADT KO mutant, as compared to every other ADT KO mutant between both proteins and transcripts at the gene product (protein or transcript) and KEGG ortholog (KEGO) enzyme family levels. Transcripts and proteins had an average correlation of 0.394 and 0.369 in leaf and stem data, respectively. Correlations increased, however, when data were further collapsed into KEGO comparisons, with abundance correlations on average being 0.615 and 0.645. Only about 30 and 28% of the transcriptome was detected at the protein level in leaf and stem data (Figure 2B), respectively, whereas KEGO level coverage was about 65%. About 17% of proteins had no detectable transcript, and about 8% of protein KEGOs had no corresponding detectable transcript KEGOs. Overlap percentages between detectable transcripts and proteins also varied due to the KEGG functional category of which they were a member (Figure 2C). Proteins present which no longer have a detectable transcript might represent long-lasting proteins or protein degradation products remaining in the cells after degradation of the corresponding mRNA have occurred. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Proposed correlations of transcript and protein data. (A) Pearson pairwise correlation plots of each log2 abundance ratio data between each ADT KO mutant versus WT dataset compared with all others in both the transcript and protein data. The two leftmost plots are from transcript and protein data, and the last two plots represent collapsed transcript and protein KEGG ortholog data (KEGO) for leaf or stem sample sets. (B) Venn diagram transcripts and proteins, and transcripts and protein KEGOs identified in leaf and stem data. (C) Transcript and protein overlap in all protein and transcript data according to KEGG functional category.To integrate transcript, protein and metabolomics data for a more direct comparison, KEGO values were compared. In this way, since protein and transcript values reflect an overall summed contribution to each enzymatic reactions, their comparisons are likely closer to metabolite abundance changes which themselves are tissue-wide summed values. Z-scores of each log2 abundance ratio transcript-metabolite-protein reaction set are displayed in Figure 3 (leaf data) and Supplementary Figures 7, 8 (stem data), respectively, with corresponding data in Supplementary Tables 2, 3. As shown in the transcript-metabolite-protein heatmaps, there are multiple enzyme KEGOs that can utilize the same substrate, but which could produce different metabolite products. Moreover, sometimes there are multiple KEGOs which carry out the same reaction. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Transcript-metabolite-protein heatmap displaying z-score comparisons of the log2 ratio pairs (ADT KO mutant/wild type, WT) of identified metabolites found to have a corresponding KEGG Ortholog Gene Family (KEGO) member which utilizes that specific metabolite as a substrate, and which were detected in both transcript and proteomics data. Each KEGO is displayed with substrate and product metabolite formed by that KEGO enzyme family. Data is further sorted into clusters that show: (A) Cluster 1–Transcripts, metabolites and proteins which all on average increased or decreased in the ADT KO mutants together compared to WT. (B) Cluster 2–Transcripts decreased, while metabolites and proteins in the ADT KO lines, on average, increased in abundance. (C) Cluster 3–Transcripts and metabolites on average in the ADT KO lines increased, and proteins decreased in abundance compared to WT. (D) Cluster 4–Transcripts and proteins decreased, and metabolites on average increased in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT. In each cluster, entries are further grouped by whether or not Metabolite 1 is a substrate or product in a unidirectional reaction or if it can be utilized in a reversible reaction. Reactions are then ordered from highest average metabolite z-score to lowest metabolite z-score. Red represents metabolites higher in abundance in the ADT KO mutant compared to WT, blue represents metabolites higher in abundance in WT compared to the ADT KO mutant, white represents metabolites unchanged in abundance between WT and the ADT KO mutant, and grey represents constituents not detected. Green squares indicate the highest average KEGO value associated with each detected metabolite. Grey circles represent KEGO reactions where there was only a single known reaction for that given substrate-product reaction. Blue circles represent log2 transcript data that is most highly correlated to log2 metabolite data across ADT KO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between transcripts and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadruple ADT KO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if the z-score values themselves were negative or positive.

Alongside z-score values for each KEGO and metabolite, indicators were added to show the reaction that represented the most abundant KEGO for multiple KEGO reactions for a given metabolite. Indicators were also added for which KEGO abundances were most highly correlated to metabolite abundances. Additionally, KEGO reactions were further grouped into categories of whether or not the detected metabolite was either substrate or product in each reaction, or if it could be involved in a reversible reaction (i.e., a metabolite that can serve as both substrate and product). Figure 4 shows distribution of reaction types (unidirectional substrate to product, or reversible) and proportion of each reaction type with KEGOs most correlated to metabolite levels, and KEGOs of greatest abundance (when there are multiple KEGOs for a given metabolite). Interestingly, for the protein KEGO data, where a given reaction type showed highest proportion of the most abundant KEGOs, it then had the least proportion of highest correlations between protein and metabolite abundances (Figures 4B,C). When comparing protein KEGO and metabolite abundance changes, we also observed that the most highly abundant KEGOs were not usually the most correlated with detected metabolite level (Figure 4), i.e., most abundant enzymes did not necessarily produce the most metabolite. Given that metabolite abundances are determined by multiple factors not represented by enzyme abundance alone (i.e., enzyme kinetics, differential degradation rates, and post-translational de/activation of enzymes), this observation is not surprising. Indeed, we can generalize that only ∼45–50% (Figure 4D) of the most abundant KEGOs produced metabolite levels that were most highly correlated to KEGO abundances. Metabolite levels controlled by other KEGOs, with low correlations to metabolite levels, may also be influenced by enzyme kinetics and post-translational activation/deactivation. Figure 4E showed that in Cluster 2 (i.e., transcripts are negatively correlated to proteins and metabolites) of the transcript-metabolite-protein comparisons, the most abundant KEGOs were present in both the leaves and stems. In contrast, Figure 4F had a negative correlation in both the leaves and stems, and in both transcript and protein data. Cluster 1 (i.e., transcript, proteins and metabolites are all positively correlated), and had the highest correlated KEGOs profiles to metabolite profiles. FIGURE 4.

(2012c) A Spearman’s rank correlation between the ADT KO mutant and WT log2 ratios to these lignin levels in 4 week old stems was thus calculated here, with proteins identified with a non-parametric measure of rank correlation (rho) of at least ±0.85. Proteins identified as having a high positive or negative correlation to varying lignin levels across ADT KO mutants were entered into the on-line network analysis tool STRING (see text footnote 7) (Szklarczyk et al., 2017). Protein-protein interactions and associations identified from STRING were then used as input data into the network software Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Z-score data representing abundance changes between ADT KO mutants and WT were overlaid on proteins (nodes), with line thicknesses (edges) of connecting proteins representing potential protein association strength as calculated by STRING analysis. Proteins found to be proximal in the initial Cytoscape network analyses were further manually grouped into KEGG functional categories to highlight relationships between functional categories. Supplementary Figure 9B shows a stem network analysis showing the z-score changes of multiple ADT KO mutant versus WT analyses. As more ADTs (and specifically as ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5) were knocked out and lignin levels decreased (Supplementary Figure 9A), protein abundances deviated further away from WT levels as indicated by nodes appearing darker red or blue in color (Supplementary Figure 9B). Figure 5A specifically shows the network analysis of adt3/4/5 stem data as compared to WT, with the ADT KO mutant having greatest reduction in lignin (cleavable monomeric G + S) levels as measured in 4 week old Arabidopsis stems (Supplementary Figure 9A)–although the lignin level difference between adt3/4/5 and adt3/4/5/6 was not statistically different. Enzymes associated with aromatic amino acid, photosynthesis, carotenoid, and α-linolenic acid metabolism were found to be apparently correlated with reduced lignin levels, and this corroborated well with KEGG functional categories identified as being significantly changed (Supplementary Figure 6A). As our focus was in identifying potential lignin-associated proteins in post-transcriptional regulation, known and predicted interactions between mRNA processing and translation machinery proteins were highlighted (see Figure 5B). Figure 5C displays the heat map of corresponding log2 z-scores of transcript and protein data scrutinized from the mRNA processing and translation machinery for all 8 ADT KO lines (Figure 5B).

Indeed, comparisons between proteomic and transcriptomic data can highlight which proteins and transcripts have a co-regulatory response (i.e., a high transcript level with a high protein level). The central dogma though is extended in this study to include metabolomics, as many metabolites represent the final product(s) biosynthesized by specific cells/tissues under various environmental conditions or through stresses at specific times during the lifespan of an organism. Protein and Transcript Comparisons In this study, it was found that transcript and protein data between ADT KO mutants correlated well within their own groups (i.e., transcript to transcript or protein to protein comparisons). However, correlations on average were quite low for transcript to protein comparisons, being better but still relatively low for transcript to protein KEGO/gene family comparisons. Venn diagrams which depict the overlap between proteins and transcripts revealed that (a) most transcripts detected did not correspond to a detectable protein, likely due to dynamic range and sampling limits of the proteomics technology compared to the depth of coverage capable with RNA-Seq and (b) not all proteins detected corresponded to a detectable transcript (Figure 2) as could arise from differential mRNA and protein degradation rates. Lack of high correlations though between transcripts and proteins have been found to be typical. In many multi-omics evaluations, across eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, transcripts and proteins are only modestly correlated (Foss et al., 2007; Ghazalpour et al., 2011; Battle et al., 2015; Chick et al., 2016; Hasin et al., 2017). Two examples from plant and animal organisms highlight this point. In a multi-omics investigation of maize, Walley et al. (2016) observed that transcriptome and proteome abundance profiles showed little overlap. In a comparable study of human disease, Hasin et al. (2017) found that transcript levels often exhibited a poor correlation with protein levels, although it was considered that the proteomics data alone was more proximal to the disease mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolite levels did not show a dominant correlation with either transcripts or proteins. These data illustrate the limitations in using only a single omics evaluation to make systems level biological assessments. Comparisons between these omics datasets may thus reveal (a) what transcripts are actually translated and in what copy number, and (b) what metabolomics data help reveal which proteins or protein families are more or less active in producing the observed metabolites. The integrated “omics” analysis, as presented here, provides over-arching and molecule specific information, which is useful for understanding general molecular pathway trends, and for identifying targets of interest for bioengineering purposes or for follow-on analyses.Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources. Such analyses can utilize enzyme relationships derived from hundreds of sources (e.g., yeast two hybrid, co-localization, co-expression, literature text mining, etc.). In turn, this can help provide new insights into interconnections and significant relationships of proteins with known and as-of-yet unknown function. Since our main focus was on proteins potentially related to altered lignin levels (as determined by thioacidolysis analysis), we selected those with greatest positive and negative correlative trends to lignin amounts present in Arabidopsis stems of each line. Centrally located in the lignin correlated protein network data created (Figures 5A,B) were eleven ribosomal subunits that correlated with reduced lignin levels. This raised the possibility that lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or “ribocode” (Mauro and Edelman, 2002; Xue and Barna, 2012). That is, lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA. Recent studies have documented evidence for ribocodes, the concept of which suggests differential, temporal and spatial presence of specific ribosomal subunits which preferentially translate specific mRNAs, thus representing regulation at translation. Other observations of possible plant ribocodes include phosphate and Fe-deficiency studies by Rodríguez-Celma et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013), who both showed evidence for remodeled translational machinery in response to environmental signals in Arabidopsis. Liu et al. (2012) also reported that translational control was mRNA abundance independent, concluding that mRNA levels had less effect on gene activity than translational control mechanisms in Arabidopsis. Other potential targets of lignin biosynthesis regulation identified included those associated with purine metabolism, the spliceosome, RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance and general mRNA processing proteins. Post-translational modifications, protein transport, and targeting mechanisms also appeared correlated with varying lignin levels. Additionally, post-translational related protein processing involving the endoplasmic reticulum was identified, as well as ubiquitin proteolysis, phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and phosphatase proteins which may be connected to important processes related to lignin biosynthesis. In our analysis as to what connects the spliceosome, which edits native mRNA into mature translatable mRNA and the ribosomal subunits, was the spliceosome protein DRH1 (At3g01540) to the large ribosomal subunit RPL2.1 (ATCG00830) (Figure 5B). DRH1 is a ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase and polynucleotide-dependent ATPase (Okanami et al., 1998). Export of poly(A)(+) RNA has been shown to be greatly blocked in DRH1 mutants (Du et al., 2016). Presence or absence of this helicase could thus serve as a level of regulation, blocking or allowing export of mRNA into the cytosol. Connected to the identified spliceosome proteins was SAP18 (Song and Galbraith, 2006). In plants, this functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with ethylene-responsive element binding factors to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of stress. A SAP18 loss of function mutant produces a plant both more susceptible to salt and impaired in chlorophyll synthesis. These data indicate what we generally observed with our multi-omics data, namely that: (a) despite any significant presence of mRNA, there are additional factors which may prevent proper processing of mRNA into mature translatable form; (b) there are also other factors which may prevent any mRNA present from ever leaving the nucleus to be translated. Together, these data also highlight the importance of proteomics to illuminate what protein products are actually present and which are potentially functional. Furthermore, the vast majority of lignin biosynthesis regulation research thus far has focused on genes and transcriptional control (Nakano et al., 2015). From this body of knowledge, we know that lignin biosynthesis is influenced by a series of transcription factors, such as NAC master switches, which can activate or repress an array of other downstream transcription factors (e.g., MYBs). What is lesser known are what additional post-transcriptional controls of lignin or other phenylpropanoids exist. Due to our discovery that modulating ADTs produces differential lignin contents in Arabidopsis, the opportunity was presented where–through this multi-omics study–we could investigate molecular profiles with step-wise decreases or increases in lockstep to varying lignin levels. These results of our investigation suggest that there are potentially multiple processes, phytohormones and layers of regulation involved in lignin biosynthesis or in response to decreased carbon flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway. Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected by ADT composition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) (Stapleton and Walbot, 1994; Landry et al., 1995; Mazza et al., 2000; Clé et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2014), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids. Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants.Potential of a Lignin Regulating “Ribocode” Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These “specialized ribosomes” suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done by Williams and Sussex (1995), it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis were mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes (Ni and Snyder, 2001; Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs (Draptchinskaia et al., 1999). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs (Slavov et al., 2015). In our study, we used the STRING (see text footnote 7) algorithm to identify connections/associations between lignin profile correlated proteins. Our results returned interactions between nucleus and plastid proteins (e.g., RPL2.1 and DRH1). While there is currently no direct evidence in Arabidopsis that this association exists, there is growing documentation of interactions between homologs of these proteins in other organisms (e.g., humans, yeast, Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori) (Garcia-Gomez et al., 2011; Havugimana et al., 2012). Additional studies, however, would need to be performed to verify the actual association, if any, between eukaryotic and plastid translation-associated proteins in Arabidopsis. These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin “ribocode.”Data Availability Statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

    "introduction": "Introduction Travel to space necessitates exposure to radiation fields containing a spectrum of charged particles having different fluences and energies (15). These fully ionized particles range from protons to iron ions and are derived from solar emissions including periodic flares (mainly protons) along with the galactic cosmic rays (High Z and Energy [HZE] particles). Exposure to such radiation poses a risk that will be proportional to the frequency of particle traversals and the radiation quality (i.e., linear energy transfer [LET]) of that particle (6, 20), although for many central nervous system (CNS) endpoints this relationship is overly simplistic. While energetic protons have relatively low LET, HZE particles typically found in space have much larger LET values that depend on the mass and energy of the ion. These highly energetic (MeV-GeV/n) particles can cause significant cellular damage by direct traversal through tissues of the body and via secondary ionizations caused by delta rays emanating from the track core (14, 41). The high and low LET characteristics of HZE particles imply that heavy ions can elicit not only extensive damage in cells directly incurring traversals (i.e., along the particle trajectory), but also wide-ranging damage to cells more distal to the track of the particle (14, 41). In either case, exposure of neural stem cells and their differentiated progeny to these radiation types can elicit oxidative stress with a range of potentially adverse consequences. Past work characterizing the radioresponse of neural stem and precursor cells exposed to HZE particles has shown that changes in oxidative stress and cell killing are generally enhanced and more prolonged when compared with lower LET radiation modalities (25, 32, 33). We have documented the capability of ionizing radiation to elicit increased oxidative stress in several types of neural stem and precursor cells (1, 29, 32, 33). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) detected after exposure to different radiation modalities have in general, been shown to be both dose-dependent and temporally persistent, albeit after relatively higher (≥1 Gy) doses (25, 32). Innovation. Studies were conducted to determine whether space-relevant fluences of High Z and Energy (HZE) particles could elicit long-lasting changes in the redox state of neural stem and precursor cells that are critical for maintaining cognitive health. Data suggest that relatively infrequent HZE events may elicit chronic changes in the physiology of such cells. To the extent that altered redox state elicits functional changes in the central nervous system, then our findings suggest that astronauts may have a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing longer-term cognitive sequelae upon return to the terrestrial environment. Past reports have typically used such higher doses, but do not represent realistic exposures that might be encountered during a short mission to the moon, or an even longer mission in space outside the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere (16, 32). The paucity of heavy ion data collected after more realistic exposure scenarios (≤1 Gy) prompted the current studies, aimed at determining the short- and long-term consequences of exposing neural stem and precursor cells to very low doses and particle fluences of 56Fe ions. Here, we report that neural stem and precursor cells exposed to very low doses and fluences of charged particles exhibit significant and prolonged increases in oxidative stress, changes that are temporally coincident with altered cognition.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Cell culture Primary neural stem/precursor cells isolated from the mouse subventricular and hippocampal dentate subgranular zones were used for all studies. These cells were grown in DME/F12 (1:1; Invitrogen), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.4%; Sigma), insulin (20 μg/ml; Sigma), progesterone (1.59 nM; Sigma), putrescine (7.7 μg/ml; Sigma), sodium selenite (24 nM; Sigma), apo-transferrin (80 μg/ml; Sigma), heparin (0.76 units/ml; Sigma), epidermal growth factor (200 ng/ml; Biomedical Technologies), and fibroblast growth factor (40 ng/ml; Peprotech). Cultures are passaged three times weekly by mechanical trituration and maintained in T25 flasks kept on an orbital shaker at slow rotation (∼50 rpm) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37°C and maximum humidity. Over the course of these experiments, cultures were maintained between passages 10–15 before irradiation and then passaged as described until the time of analysis. Under these conditions, cells routinely exhibit doubling times of 20–22 h. Animals Mice (C57BL/6J background) were used and all animal procedures were carried out in accordance with  and IACUC guidelines. For antioxidant measurements, 2-month-old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n=30) were used divided as 0 Gy (n=6), 0.5 Gy (n=4), and 2 Gy (n=4), with irradiated groups analyzed 2 and 4 weeks following irradiation. For cognitive studies, 2-month-old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n=16) were irradiated with 600 MeV/n iron ions and subjected to NOR or the MWM 2 weeks after exposure. For the assessment of NOR 12 weeks after exposure, animals were irradiated with 600 MeV/n oxygen or titanium ions at BNL. Irradiation Iron ion (600 MeV/n; LET 180 keV/μm) irradiations were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL. For the majority of irradiations (≥1 cGy), dose rates between 5 and 50 cGy/min were used, where spatial beam uniformity was confirmed with a digital beam imager and beam dosimetry was measured with an ion chamber. Further details of this beam have been described (36). At lower ion fluences (500–30,000 ions/cm2), dosimetry was done by means of a count-based cutoff, in which a scintillation counter was used to give a signal for each ion track through it. Signals from the primary ion are well separated, larger and far more numerous than those derived from fragments. A pulse-height discriminator is used to ensure that only the primary ions are counted by the scaler, which in turn cuts the beam off when the desired number of counts is reached. Since fragments represent roughly 2% of the total fluence, this method provides a straightforward method for quantifying dose. Dose can be easily converted to number of ions/cm2; for example, 0.1 cGy of Fe at 600 MeV/n is delivered by 3.6×103 ions/cm2. The counter is 1 cm2 and can accept up to about 105 counts/spill, while the beam can be reduced to 102 ions/cm2 per spill, thereby providing a useful method for measuring dose over the low ion fluences used in this study. The NSRL physics staff performed all dosimetry and further details regarding similar dosimetry setups have been published (53). For all 600 MeV/n 56Fe ion exposures neurospheres were split the day before irradiation. Spheres re-form during this preirradiation interval, approaching diameters of 74±5 μm containing 234±65 cells. For irradiation, cells were gently loaded into 15 ml centrifuge tubes and placed in the beamline horizontally using a low-density polystyrene holder to minimize any scatter from nuclear fragmentation. Tubes were placed within a region of 95% beam uniformity and oriented such that the beam entered from the side of the tube. Calculations using NASA's GERM code indicate that fragmentation of iron ions passing through the maximum depth results in 11% of the fluence from fragments (mostly protons and alphas). Despite the fragmentation, the overwhelming contribution to dose is from primary iron particles. Following irradiation, cells were seeded into flasks or multiwell plates for the analysis of survival and oxidative stress. Culture conditions were carefully optimized to maintain all cells in log-phase growth over each of the postirradiation times and to normalize the initial distribution of cells between flasks for each of the experimental conditions. For in vivo antioxidant measurements, mice were subjected to whole body γ-irradiation (0.1 or 1.0 Gy) using a 137Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 2.07 Gy/min. For the in vivo cognitive experiments, mice were shipped to BNL. After a 1-week acclimation period, the mice were either sham-irradiated or whole body irradiated with 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles at a dose of 0.1 Gy or irradiated with 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles at a dose of 5 or 30 cGy. For 56Fe irradiations, cognitive testing began 1 week after the mice arrived at OHSU (i.e., 2 weeks postexposure) and for 16O or 48Ti irradiations, cognitive testing was conducted at UCI, 12 weeks after exposure. Cell survival and neurosphere assays Irradiated cultures were analyzed for cell numbers and sphere forming capacity to ascertain the impact of charged particle irradiation on stem and precursor cells. Following irradiation neurosphere cultures were either seeded into flasks for the quantification of cell number or into 96-well plates for the determination of sphere forming capacity. Bulk neurosphere cultures were dissociated 5 days following exposure and counted by hemocytometer. Alternatively, irradiated cultures were dissociated the day of irradiation, diluted into 96-well plates and analyzed by eye for the presence of spheres. The number of spheres counted 5 days following exposure was equated to surviving fraction, adjusted by the number of cells seeded per well. Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of redox-sensitive dyes Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to quantify the levels of reactive species in cells subjected to charged particle irradiation. After irradiation and on the day of assay, cells were aliquoted into 24-well plates. Multiple wells were used for the various dyes, doses, and postirradiation times analyzed. The ROS/RNS-sensitive dye 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, 5 μM; Invitrogen), the NO-sensitive dye DAF (5 μM; Invitrogen), or the superoxide-sensitive dye MitoSOX (0.5 μM; Invitrogen) was added 1 h prior to analysis by FACS. Approximately 10 min prior to FACS analysis, neurospheres were mechanically dissociated by trituration into single cell suspensions subjected to FACS analysis. Details regarding antioxidant measurements and cognitive testing can be found online in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ars). Statistical analysis Data is expressed as the mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent measurements and the level of significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, one way) with Bonferroni's multiple comparison and Student's t-tests employing Prism data analysis software (v3.0). For the cognitive test, (ANOVA, one-way) was used to assess group differences in exploratory times, with irradiation as between subject factor. To analyze preference for the novel object, Student t-tests were used. Statistical significance was assigned at a p≤0.05.",
    "results": "Results Stem and precursor cell survival following charged particle exposure Neurosphere cultures maintained over time contain mixtures of precursor cells derived from much smaller proportions of stem cells. Cell counts made from irradiated cultures measure the proliferative potential of the surviving precursor cell population that predominate the bulk culture. Irradiation of neurosphere cultures reduces the number of cells in a dose-responsive manner, with a D37 of 1.8 Gy in the low dose range (≤2 Gy, Fig. 1, solid line). At higher doses bulk cell counts were less responsive to dose. Sphere formation was surprisingly resistant to charged particle irradiation, as the formation of spheres showed little dependence on the incident dose (Fig. 1, dashed line). While these assays measure different endpoints, data does suggest that neurosphere cultures contain populations of cells with different sensitivities to charged particle irradiation, likely due to the presence of partially committed stem cell progeny at various states of differentiation. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Cell survival and sphere formation following charged particle exposure. Neural stem and precursor cells subjected to iron ion irradiation were analyzed 5 days later for cell counts and sphere formation. The surviving fraction represents the number of cells (solid line) or spheres (dashed line) corrected for seeding density and normalized to unirradiated controls. Error bars represent the mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent measurements. *p<0.05; **p<0.001 for differences between precursor cells and spheres. Low dose charged particle-induced oxidative stress To determine the consequences of low dose charged particle exposure on the redox state of neural stem and precursor cells, cultures were exposed to multiple doses of 600 MeV/n Fe ions and analyzed over short (days) and long (weeks) postirradiation intervals for changes in oxidative stress. Extensive controls conducted throughout these studies using a cell-permeant oxidized analog of CM-H2DCFDA (i.e., carboxy-DCFDA) indicated that measurements of radiation-induced oxidative stress were not caused by differences in dye uptake, esterase cleavage, and/or retention of the dye between the experimental groups. Neurospheres exposed to 1–15 cGy of Fe ions exhibit a dose-dependent and significant rise in ROS/RNS as detected by the oxidation of the CM-H2DCFDA analog 12 and 24 h after exposure (Fig. 2). At the earlier time, oxidative stress was observed to rise steadily with dose, reaching a sixfold peak after 15 cGy. At the latter time, significant dose-dependent increases in ROS/RNS were found as doses were escalated to 3 cGy, after which ROS/RNS levels were found to plateau approximately fourfold over sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Dose-response for oxidative stress after low dose irradiation of neural stem and precursor cells with 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions. Neurospheres were irradiated from 1–15 cGy and analyzed for increased ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dye CM-H2DCFDA 12 and 24 h afterward. Compared to sham-irradiated controls, low dose exposure elicited a dose-responsive increase in oxidative stress at each postirradiation time. All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. One-way ANOVA is significant (p<0.0001) and **p<0.001. ANOVA, analysis of variance; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species.The marked low dose-responsive character of radiation-induced oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells suggested these cells were exquisitely sensitive to irradiation. To determine whether very low ion fluences could elicit measureable changes in reactive species, a modified dosimetry was used to quantify the number of ions/cm2. At these low ion fluences, not every cell incurs an incident ion traversal, so reference to dose becomes less meaningful. Exposure of neurosphere cultures to these very low ion fluences was still found to elicit elevated oxidative stress at similar acute postirradiation times (Fig. 3). Increased levels of ROS and RNS probed through the use of CM-H2DCFDA and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF) dyes respectively, showed variable fluence dependent responses 6 h (Fig. 3A) and 24 h (Fig. 3B) after exposures ranging from 500–30,000 Fe ions/cm2. Fluences as low as 500–3000 ions/cm2 were found to elicit increased oxidative stress at most postirradiation times, where fluence responses ≤1000 ions/cm2 are shown at expanded scale (Fig. 3A1, B1). At 6 h postirradiation ROS and RNS levels rose to 2.5 and 2.1-fold over unirradiated controls respectively, after exposure to 30,000 ions/cm2. One day following low fluence exposures cells exhibited a rapid rise in ROS/RNS levels at lower fluences (≤3000 ions/cm2). At higher fluences, RNS levels continued to rise while ROS levels reached a plateau (Fig. 3B). The increased oxidative stress found after low ion fluences was not the consequence of a highly fluorescent subpopulation of cells, since data represent the mean fluorescence of all cells analyzed, gated only to eliminate debris and dead cells. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Low fluence response for the induction of ROS/RNS after charged particle irradiation. Neurospheres were subjected to 600 MeV/n Fe ions at low ion fluences (500–30,000 particles/cm2) and assayed for ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dyes CM-H2DCFDA and DAF, 6 h (A) and 24 h afterward (B). Lower fluence responses are shown at expanded scale (A1, B1). Low particle fluences were found to cause dose-responsive increases in oxidative stress at each of these early postirradiation times. All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. One-way ANOVA is significant (p<0.0001, A and p<0.003, B) and *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.Neural stem and precursor cells subjected to similar low fluences of 56Fe ions and analyzed over longer postirradiation intervals (36–48 h) routinely showed trends toward increased oxidative species (ROS/RNS) compared with sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 4). This was particularly evident for ROS (Fig. 4A) and at higher fluences levels for RNS (Fig. 4B). At these longer postirradiation intervals the oxidative stress response was more complex and did not show the same dependence on fluence. Relative levels of ROS were in general found to be higher than the relative levels of RNS measured at these times. Low fluence data indicate that very low numbers of ion traversals incurred in a population of irradiated neural stem and precursor cells is sufficient to promote a state of oxidative stress. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Low fluence response for the induction of ROS/RNS after charged particle irradiation. Neurospheres subjected to 600 MeV/n Fe ions at low fluences (500–30,000 particles/cm2) were assayed 36 and 48 h after irradiation for ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dyes CM-H2DCFDA (A) and DAF (B). At these longer postirradiation intervals, low particle fluences were still found to elicit increase in oxidative stress over unirradiated controls. At these longer times however, dose-responsive increases were less evident, and elevated nitric oxide was apparent at only the higher fluences levels (≤30,000 particles/cm2). All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. ** p<0.05. Persistent oxidative stress after low dose charged particle irradiation The marked sensitivity of neural stem and precursor cells to changes in redox state caused by low dose charged particle irradiation has indicated that exposure to realistic doses (≤1 Gy) of space radiation can induce oxidative stress. To determine the persistence of such radiation-induced effects, neurospheres subjected to iron ion irradiation at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) were analyzed over the course of 2 months. Neurosphere cultures maintained over these extended postirradiation intervals show a marked persistence of radiation-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 5). Analyses of cells loaded with CM-H2DCFDA indicate that compared to unirradiated controls, there is a trend toward increasing oxidative stress at each of the postirradiation times (Fig. 5A). Dose-responsive increases in ROS/RNS levels are observed 1 and 4 weeks after irradiation, a trend that then breaks down 6 and 8 weeks after initial exposure. The wide variability found in many samples is not unexpected, given the protracted nature of these measurements. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Persistent oxidative stress in neural precursors exposed to 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions. Cells exposed to low dose 56Fe ion irradiation were incubated with either CM-H2DCFDA (A), Mitosox (B), or DAF (C) and analyzed for persistent ROS/RNS, superoxide, or nitric oxide respectively at the indicated times. In each case a trend was observed for elevated oxidative species that persisted over the course of 5–8 weeks. All data were normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. Error bars represent mean±S.E.M. of two to three measurements.In parallel experiments, cells were also analyzed using the Mitosox dye to assess the level of superoxide persisting after charged particle exposures (Fig. 5B). Compared to data collected with the CM-H2DCFDA dye, qualitatively similar increases in superoxide levels were found after the same doses and postirradiation intervals. Superoxide levels were proportional to dose at earlier times (≤4 weeks), and less so at latter postirradiation times (≥6 weeks), while overall changes were less pronounced when compared to ROS/RNS levels. While variability between replicate samples precluded significance of all data sets shown, there was a clear trend toward elevated superoxide at all postirradiation times. In a separate series of experiments conducted over two experimental campaigns at BNL, analogous experiments were run to quantify any long-lasting changes in the level of nitric oxide (NO) after low dose charged particle exposures. Neurospheres subjected to similar doses and analyzed over the course of 5 weeks were found to exhibit increased NO levels (Fig. 5C). Dose-responsive increases were most notable 3 weeks after irradiation, while the extent of increased radiation-induced NO levels was similar in magnitude to those increases noted for superoxide. As with the other protracted postirradiation analyses, changes did not reach statistical significance when compared to sham-irradiated controls, although trends of increased NO were evident at several time points (Fig. 5C). In vivo measurement of antioxidant capacity To assess the potential impact of irradiation on the antioxidant capacity of the brain, neural tissue isolated from mice subjected to low dose whole body irradiation was subjected to a battery of assays to quantify the activities of selected antioxidants. Brains isolated from animals given 0.1 or 1.0 Gy of γ-irradiation were analyzed for changes in antioxidant levels and enzyme activities 2 and 4 weeks after exposure. At 2 weeks postirradiation there was a significant drop (53%, p<0.001) in the percentage of glutathione expressed as the disulfide form (GSSG) at each dose compared with unirradiated controls (Fig. 6A). This value trended higher by 4 weeks, where the percentage of GSSG was increased by 19% and 12% after 0.1 and 1.0 Gy respectively (Fig. 6A). When expressed as the ratio of GSH:GSSG (Fig. 6B), the data show a significant increase in reduced GSH 2 weeks following irradiation, with a trend toward increased oxidized GSSG 4 weeks after exposure. Catalase activity (mk units/mg) showed a dose-responsive increase at 2 weeks, where 0.1 and 1.0 Gy doses significantly increased activity by 57% and 68% respectively (Fig. 6C). At 4 weeks postirradiation catalase activity returned to background (Fig. 6C). At the earlier 2-week time, SOD activities (U/mg protein) trended higher, with significant increases of 34% (p<0.007) and 26% (p<0.004) for MnSOD (0.1 Gy, Fig. 6D) and Cu,Zn-SOD (1.0 Gy, Fig. 6E) respectively. These increases translated to a significant rise (27%, p<0.02) in total SOD activity 2 weeks following exposure (Fig. 6F). At the 4-week time, SOD activity was also found to return to background levels. Analysis of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity also revealed significant increases of 52% (p<0.0001) and 44% (p<0.0001) 2 weeks following 0.1 and 1.0 Gy respectively, which then declined to unirradiated control levels by week 4 (Fig. 6G). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity measurements showed similar upward trends at both postirradiation times and doses, with a significant increase of 24% (p<0.02) found at 2 weeks after dose of 0.1 Gy (Fig. 6H). Collectively, data show that antioxidant levels were routinely elevated 2 weeks after either irradiation before dropping to controls levels 2 weeks thereafter. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Antioxidant assessment in the irradiated brain. Following irradiation, brains were prepared for the measurement of antioxidant levels (A, B) and various enzymatic activities (C–H). Irradiation with 0.1 or 1.0 Gy led to a significant (p<0.0001) increase in GSH levels at 2 weeks, with a trend toward elevated GSSG at week 4 following irradiation (A, B). Catalase (C) and SOD (D–F) activities were increased significantly (to varying extents) 2 weeks after irradiation, but not at week 4. GPx and GST activities followed similar trends (G, H). GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GST, glutathione-S-transferase. p-values: *, 0.02; **, 0.07; ***, 0.04; ++, 0.0002; +++, 0.0001. Impaired novel object recognition in 56Fe-irradiated mice To determine whether these data were associated with in vivo functional changes, novel object recognition (NOR) was assessed 2 weeks after irradiation with 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles at a dose of 10 cGy. Irradiated mice did not show any signs of distress or physical impairments throughout testing. Further, no motor deficits were observed in the irradiated mice during any of the cognitive tasks. Both groups (control and irradiated) spent a comparable amount of time exploring the two identical objects during training. During testing, sham-irradiated male mice spent significantly more time exploring the novel object compared with the familiar object (p<0.05) (Fig. 7). In contrast, irradiated male mice showed no preference for the novel object (Fig. 7). FIG. 7. Open in a new tab Novel object recognition of sham-irradiated and 56Fe-irradiated male mice. The DI shows reduced exploratory preference for the novel object over the familiar object 2-weeks after irradiation. N=8 mice/treatment. *p<0.05 (two-tailed t-test). DI, discrimination index.Additional testing of the 56Fe-irradiated animals in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) did not uncover any cognitive deficits in spatial memory retention, as both control and irradiated cohorts spent equal amounts of time exploring the target quadrant containing the escape platform for which they were trained (data not shown). Based on these results, additional cognitive testing (NOR) was undertaken on a dedicated cohort of animals 12 weeks after exposure to 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles at doses of 5 and 30 cGy. Animals subjected to 5 or 30 cGy exhibited significant deficits in NOR when analyzed 12 weeks after exposure (Fig. 8). Animals irradiated with 16O particles exhibited significant reductions (67%, p<0.05) at both doses, while animals exposed to 48Ti particles showed a significant reduction (65%, p<0.05) at the higher dose and a trend for lower exploration (50%) at the lower dose (Fig. 8). These data clearly demonstrated that low dose exposure to charged particles leads to impaired NOR performance over extended postirradiation times. FIG. 8. Open in a new tab Impaired recognition memory in mice detected 12 weeks after exposure to 16O or 48Ti particles. The NOR task was used to calculate a DI, which shows that all irradiated cohorts had reduced preference to explore the novel object compared to unirradiated controls. Controls (0 Gy) showed selective preference for the novel object (DI=46.64±5.3). Exposure to 600 MeV/n 16O particles reduced exploration of the novel object significantly (DI=15.7±4.1, p<0.05 at 5 cGy; DI=14.78±11.8, p<0.05 at 30 cGy). Similarly, exposure to 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles was also found to significantly reduce exploration for the novel object (DI=23.74±12.8, p<0.05 at 5 cGy; DI=16.4±6.6, p<0.05 at 30 cGy).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Few studies have investigated the effects of charged particles on neural stem and precursor cells exposed to the low ion fluences expected on a space mission outside the earth's magnetosphere (21, 32). Past work from our lab has characterized the radiation response of multipotent neural cells grown as monolayers to high and low LET radiation, and has shown that following irradiation these cells exhibit a marked rise in acute and persistent oxidative stress that is associated with increased apoptosis, an inhibition of cell cycle progression, and marked radiosensitivity (25, 32, 33). Our present study extends past findings by analyzing multipotent neural cells grown as neurospheres that were exposed to varying doses of charged particles. Present studies also placed an emphasis on very low fluences of HZE particles more typical of the actual space radiation environment, and on analysis of cells over protracted postirradiation times to gauge the long-term consequences of charged particle exposure on astronauts. Neurosphere cultures are heterogeneous populations of multipotent cells, comprised of stem cells, their immediate precursor progeny, along with smaller fractions of cells partially committed to neuronal or glial fates (23). Mixed populations of multipotent cell types would be expected to possess intrinsic differences in radiosensitivity, and past reports using other cell systems support this hypothesis (12, 52). To uncover potential differences in radiation sensitivity, neurosphere cultures were subjected to higher doses of charged particles and analyzed for overall cell survival or sphere forming capacity. Quantification of cell counts or sphere formation 5 days following irradiation revealed a marked difference in the sensitivity of these assays to iron ion exposure. Bulk cell counts showed that the predominant population of neural precursor cells was more sensitive to charged particle exposure than neural stem cells. For the relatively higher doses used in these studies, radiation-induced double-strand break formation was the most likely cause of cell death, as opposed to the inhibition of proliferation. While the dependence of sphere forming assays on stem cells is not without caveats, past work has suggested that the presence of stem cells does promote the formation of spheres (2, 35). The capability of irradiated cultures to re-form spheres after such high doses of charged particles suggests that neural stem cells are more radioresistant than their immediate progeny. Neurospheres subjected to space relevant fluences of charged particles exhibited radiation-induced oxidative stress that was generally found to be dose responsive at earlier postirradiation intervals (<1 week). At longer times postirradiation, radiation-induced changes in oxidative stress were less linearly dependent on dose and showed greater variability and a tendency to plateau. The dose dependency of radiation-induced oxidative stress suggested cause and effect, but also suggested the existence of nontargeted effects. As alluded to above, many of these studies were performed to determine whether doses corresponding to less than one particle traversal/cell led to any significant changes in oxidative stress. Doses delivered over the range of 1–15 cGy (Fig. 2) correspond to 0.041–0.59 average hits/cell (where “hit” indicates traversal of any part of the geometric cross section of the cell), based on an average cellular radius of 6 μm. At these low doses, from 4% to 45% of the cells incur hits after 1 and 15 cGy respectively. Given the paucity of cells traversed at the lowest doses and ion fluences used in these studies, data suggested that direct particle traversals was not a prerequisite for charged particle-induced oxidative stress. Neurospheres irradiated with very low particle fluences were analyzed for changes in reactive species over the following 2 days (Figs. 3 and 4). Depending on time and reactive species, as few as 500 ions/cm2 were found to elicit increased oxidative stress. At this low ion fluence, as few as 1/1770 cells or 1/50 neurospheres were hit (based on an average neurosphere radius of 37 μm at the time of irradiation) by the incident Fe ions. Increasing the fluence of incident ions was in general found to elicit a progressive increase in the levels of ROS/RNS. When fluences were adjusted to hit every neurosphere once, on average, or 1/30 cells (i.e., 30,000 ions/cm2), oxidative stress was usually at a relative maximum within 2 days of exposure (Figs. 3 and 4). Despite the postirradiation variations in temporal response for oxidative stress in cells subjected to low dose exposures, overall trends were observed for increased charged particle-induced oxidative stress. The quality and quantity of damage types to various target molecules in cells subjected to the high ionization densities near the center of a track (track core) will differ from those in cells more distal to the track where secondary electrons (delta rays) produce more dispersed patterns of ionization. While ionization patterns are stochastic, on average the ionization density varies continuously as a function of 1/radial distance2 from the track center (10, 11, 13). Thus the “core” is a term of convenience. The GERM code can be used to calculate this distribution (14). Cellular damage resulting from HZE particles is known to include a high multiplicity of damaged sites within submicron volumes that impedes the repair and recovery of the exposed cells (26). However, superimposed on the population of cells directly traversed by high LET particles are larger populations of cells that received exposure only from the lower LET delta rays at distances greater than a few tens of nanometers. The damage sustained by the latter cells will be of lower multiplicity and will be more effectively managed by cellular damage detection and repair systems. From the GERM code we may estimate that all sites within a cylindrical volume of radius 1.4 μm will receive at least 10 cGy local dose, all sites within a 4.5 μm radius cylindrical volume will receive at least 1 cGy, and all sites within 14 μm will receive at least 0.1 cGy for 600 MeV/n 56Fe. Given a neurosphere of 74 μm in diameter containing about 235 cells, a particle traversing the full diameter will “hit” about six or seven cells. However, on the order of 20 cells will receive exposures above 1 cGy, representing about 1/2 of their volumes. An intermediate number of cells will experience doses>10 cGy over parts of their volumes. However, for exposures above 0.1 cGy almost 1/4th of the cells in the neurosphere will be involved. It is also worth noting that particles simply passing within ∼10 μm of a neurosphere may impart low LET exposures (>0.1 cGy) to neighboring cells, effectively increasing the proportion of “hit” spheres at low fluences. Low LET radiation doses of 1–10 cGy have been shown to be effective as priming doses in adaptive effect investigations and therefore can modulate cell damage detection and repair properties. This may be in part due to changes in mitochondrial function (cytoplasm) and not just to cell nuclear damage (7). Even lower doses of gamma rays (∼0.1 cGy) can modify the frequency of neoplastic transformation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (3). Thus, delta-ray exposures associated with tracks must be considered significant contributors to overall responses of neurosphere cell populations, and may account for some of the resistance observed in irradiated neurospheres at higher doses (Fig. 1). Given the cellular growth geometries of neurospheres and the geometry of tracks, it is highly likely that the oxidative stress response observed under limiting particle fluences can in part be attributed to delta ray exposures many microns away from the track center. Reactive species, emanating from cells hit by cores or peripheries of tracks may then go on to mediate further nontargeted effects. While not the focus of this study, significant published data show that radiation-induced oxidative stress serves as a biochemical mechanism regulating certain nontargeted effects (18, 22, 33, 49). While low dose acute effects may have an adverse impact on mission-specific tasks, performance decrements are not the only potential risks associated with CNS exposure to the space radiation environment. Additional studies were conducted to ascertain the long-term changes to redox state associated with low dose exposure to HZE particles. Cells analyzed over 1–8 weeks following exposure to Fe ions at BNL were found to show increased levels of ROS/RNS at most times (Fig. 5). Given the protracted nature of these measurements, and the inherent differences between individual accelerator campaigns conducted over several years, the wide experimental variability is not altogether unexpected. Rather than over interpret the subtle to more robust fluctuations in the levels of the reactive species measured, it seems more appropriate to comment on the overall trends found. Clearly, over the 2-month postirradiation interval analyzed changes in oxidative stress occurred. The levels of ROS/RNS, superoxide, and NO levels were elevated compared with sham-irradiated controls analyzed in parallel, and increased oxidative stress was not found to be below background levels postirradiation. While the dose dependency of these effects did not reach significance the alterations to the redox state of cells never appeared to stabilize or fall below basal levels. Over the range of applied doses, acute exposure to iron ions led to a perturbation of oxidative stress that did not abate. The data suggest that as a general trend, exposure to charged particles elicits essentially permanent changes to the redox state of surviving cells. Fluorogenic dyes provide convenient readouts for the overall redox state of cells subjected to irradiation, but their usage is associated with several limitations that have recently been reviewed (28). The oxidation of CM-H2DCFDA is susceptible to peroxidase activity, iron signaling, redox cycling, and one-electron oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (·OH), peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and other reactive intermediates (28). The red fluorescence derived from Mitosox may not entirely be due to mitochondrially-derived superoxide, as other oxidants (·OH, ONOO−) can generate alternative species with overlapping fluorescent spectra (28). Similarly, DAF reacts with NO and other NO oxidation products to yield fluorescent adducts (40). Thus, while the complexity of the intracellular redox chemistry precludes direct assignment of fluorescent signals derived from oxidized dyes to specific reactive species or their sites of production, our data does suggest that irradiation elicits an overall imbalance in redox homeostasis that promotes a persistent oxidative stress in irradiated cells. Past work has shown that irradiation disrupts mitochondrial function through alterations in the permeability transition and electron transport thereby increasing release of ROS/RNS (30). Related work from us and others has identified defects in mitochondrial complex II, and possibly mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunit D that are likely to contribute to the elevation in reactive species after irradiation (17, 39). Thus, radiation-induced alterations in mitochondrial function are likely to be responsible for a significant fraction of the persistent oxidative stress observed in these studies. The issue of whether radiation-induced levels of oxidative stress are good or bad in the context CNS functionality is more difficult to ascertain. Increased levels of proxidants found after irradiation may not translate to oxidative injury, a limitation that complicates the assessment of physiological relevance. Further, low dose (<1 Gy) radiation effects are known to differ from those occurring after higher doses, where low dose stimulation of redox signaling may provide neuroprotective effects as opposed to higher dose inhibition of these pathways. Interestingly, these observations fit with the emerging concepts of hormetic dose responses and how they might engage “vitagene” networks to promote neuroprotection [recently reviewed in (9)]. Past work from our lab has found that excess superoxide derived from genetic disruption of SOD isoforms is neuroprotective after cranial irradiation (24, 46). More recent studies from our lab using a transgenic mouse model (MCAT) that overexpresses human catalase targeted to the mitochondria provide further support for the importance of redox balance in the CNS (31). Low dose (proton) stimulation of endogenous neural precursor cell proliferation was attenuated in MCAT mice, while promoting neurogenesis after low (0.5 Gy) but not high dose (2 Gy). Related findings from our group have shown protective radioadaptation in cultured neural stem and precursor cells after low but not high dose exposure to protons and γ-rays (50). Improved survival after low dose exposure could be eliminated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, providing further evidence for the importance of redox homeostasis in irradiated cells. Thus, evidence suggests that low dose exposure and/or physiologic levels of reactive species may promote neuroprotection, at least at the cellular level. It is more difficult to predict how such changes might impact a multifaceted endpoint such as cognition, but redox imbalance may well alter the long-term functionality of the brain. Application of similar dye based approaches to detect transient reactive species in vivo are more complicated, and prompted our analyses of antioxidant levels and enzyme activities in mice subjected to low dose irradiation. The ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione was reduced significantly at both doses 2 weeks after irradiation, which was consistent with the significant increase in activity of all antioxidant enzymes measured at that time (i.e., catalase, total SOD, GPx, and GST) (Fig. 6). Elevated enzymatic activities were found to return to background levels 1 month after irradiation, a time in which the level of GSSG:GSG trended upward to a more oxidized state (Fig. 6). The dynamic response of brain antioxidants to acute exposure suggest a compensatory response to elevated oxidative stress over 2 weeks, which is then attenuated over longer times. While the precise mechanism/s underlying these antioxidant responses is uncertain, it suggests again that changes in redox metabolism could alter oxidative stress levels to impact the functionality of the irradiated CNS. In addition to radiation-induced oxidative stress, heavy ion exposure has been linked to neuroinflammation and altered hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed 2–9 months before (43–45). Alterations to neurogenesis may explain certain observations in earlier (47, 48) and more recent (27) reports of reduced spatial learning in rats exposed to 1 GeV/n iron ions. Other mechanisms involving impaired glutamatergic transmission (37), altered autophagy (42) and synaptic protein alterations (19) are likely to contribute to functional decrements in cognition. Neurocognitive tasks dependent on other nonhippocampal areas of the brain are also altered after heavy ion exposure (4, 5, 34), as exposure to low doses of iron ions was found to impair the ability of rats to conduct attentional set-shifting, suggesting deficits in executive function (34). While the link between radiation-induced oxidative stress and impaired executive function is uncertain, the antioxidant α-lipoic acid was found to prevent certain spatial memory impairments caused by heavy ion exposures (51). While it remains uncertain how the persistent changes in redox state observed following charged particle exposure might impact performance decrements during spaceflight or long-term cognitive health, the impairments in NOR (Fig. 7) seen after low dose 56Fe irradiation support the functional significance of these low dose radiation effects. The deficits observed after 56Fe irradiation on the NOR task did not translate to functional decrements when animals were assessed in the water maze test. Reasons for this are uncertain, but may indicate that neurocognitive sequelae had insufficient time to fully develop over this relatively brief postirradiation (i.e., 2 weeks) interval. The fact that radiation-induced cognitive impairment develops over months to years in patients receiving much higher total doses during clinical radiotherapy supports this idea (8, 38). Further, the MWM interrogates different regions of the brain than does the NOR task (4, 5), and NOR performance may in fact provide a more sensitive indicator of nonhippocampal (perirhinal and prefrontal cortex) dependent deficits caused by irradiation. The foregoing possibilities prompted further investigations into the impact of heavy ion irradiation, where animals exposed to low doses (5 or 30 cGy) of 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles were analyzed 12 weeks later for deficits in NOR. These data show that NOR was impaired significantly at these protracted postirradiation times, where the tendency to explore novelty was reduced on average by 67% for all cohorts compared to sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 8). Given these low doses and protracted times of analyses, these findings are noteworthy, and suggest that exposure to space relevant fluences of charged particles is associated with a risk for developing certain performance decrements. Since animals explore objects equally during familiarization and exhibit no signs of neophobia, deficits in NOR are likely due to impaired learning and/or memory rather than reduced curiosity. Whether or not the chronic trends of elevated oxidative stress found after such exposures are causal and/or contributory to the observed neurocognitive sequelae remain to be elucidated. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate a temporal coincidence between radiation-induced oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction, and suggest a link between altered redox metabolism in the CNS and functional behavioral outcome.",

Copyright notice ID: 3936501 PMID: 23802883 Abstract Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 20, 1410–1422.Introduction Travel to space necessitates exposure to radiation fields containing a spectrum of charged particles having different fluences and energies (15). These fully ionized particles range from protons to iron ions and are derived from solar emissions including periodic flares (mainly protons) along with the galactic cosmic rays (High Z and Energy [HZE] particles). Exposure to such radiation poses a risk that will be proportional to the frequency of particle traversals and the radiation quality (i.e., linear energy transfer [LET]) of that particle (6, 20), although for many central nervous system (CNS) endpoints this relationship is overly simplistic. While energetic protons have relatively low LET, HZE particles typically found in space have much larger LET values that depend on the mass and energy of the ion. These highly energetic (MeV-GeV/n) particles can cause significant cellular damage by direct traversal through tissues of the body and via secondary ionizations caused by delta rays emanating from the track core (14, 41). The high and low LET characteristics of HZE particles imply that heavy ions can elicit not only extensive damage in cells directly incurring traversals (i.e., along the particle trajectory), but also wide-ranging damage to cells more distal to the track of the particle (14, 41). In either case, exposure of neural stem cells and their differentiated progeny to these radiation types can elicit oxidative stress with a range of potentially adverse consequences. Past work characterizing the radioresponse of neural stem and precursor cells exposed to HZE particles has shown that changes in oxidative stress and cell killing are generally enhanced and more prolonged when compared with lower LET radiation modalities (25, 32, 33). We have documented the capability of ionizing radiation to elicit increased oxidative stress in several types of neural stem and precursor cells (1, 29, 32, 33). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) detected after exposure to different radiation modalities have in general, been shown to be both dose-dependent and temporally persistent, albeit after relatively higher (≥1 Gy) doses (25, 32). Innovation. Studies were conducted to determine whether space-relevant fluences of High Z and Energy (HZE) particles could elicit long-lasting changes in the redox state of neural stem and precursor cells that are critical for maintaining cognitive health. Data suggest that relatively infrequent HZE events may elicit chronic changes in the physiology of such cells. To the extent that altered redox state elicits functional changes in the central nervous system, then our findings suggest that astronauts may have a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing longer-term cognitive sequelae upon return to the terrestrial environment.Past reports have typically used such higher doses, but do not represent realistic exposures that might be encountered during a short mission to the moon, or an even longer mission in space outside the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere (16, 32). The paucity of heavy ion data collected after more realistic exposure scenarios (≤1 Gy) prompted the current studies, aimed at determining the short- and long-term consequences of exposing neural stem and precursor cells to very low doses and particle fluences of 56Fe ions. Here, we report that neural stem and precursor cells exposed to very low doses and fluences of charged particles exhibit significant and prolonged increases in oxidative stress, changes that are temporally coincident with altered cognition.Results Stem and precursor cell survival following charged particle exposure Neurosphere cultures maintained over time contain mixtures of precursor cells derived from much smaller proportions of stem cells. Cell counts made from irradiated cultures measure the proliferative potential of the surviving precursor cell population that predominate the bulk culture. Irradiation of neurosphere cultures reduces the number of cells in a dose-responsive manner, with a D37 of 1.8 Gy in the low dose range (≤2 Gy, Fig. 1, solid line). At higher doses bulk cell counts were less responsive to dose. Sphere formation was surprisingly resistant to charged particle irradiation, as the formation of spheres showed little dependence on the incident dose (Fig. 1, dashed line). While these assays measure different endpoints, data does suggest that neurosphere cultures contain populations of cells with different sensitivities to charged particle irradiation, likely due to the presence of partially committed stem cell progeny at various states of differentiation.

Extensive controls conducted throughout these studies using a cell-permeant oxidized analog of CM-H2DCFDA (i.e., carboxy-DCFDA) indicated that measurements of radiation-induced oxidative stress were not caused by differences in dye uptake, esterase cleavage, and/or retention of the dye between the experimental groups. Neurospheres exposed to 1–15 cGy of Fe ions exhibit a dose-dependent and significant rise in ROS/RNS as detected by the oxidation of the CM-H2DCFDA analog 12 and 24 h after exposure (Fig. 2). At the earlier time, oxidative stress was observed to rise steadily with dose, reaching a sixfold peak after 15 cGy. At the latter time, significant dose-dependent increases in ROS/RNS were found as doses were escalated to 3 cGy, after which ROS/RNS levels were found to plateau approximately fourfold over sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Dose-response for oxidative stress after low dose irradiation of neural stem and precursor cells with 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions. Neurospheres were irradiated from 1–15 cGy and analyzed for increased ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dye CM-H2DCFDA 12 and 24 h afterward. Compared to sham-irradiated controls, low dose exposure elicited a dose-responsive increase in oxidative stress at each postirradiation time. All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. One-way ANOVA is significant (p<0.0001) and **p<0.001. ANOVA, analysis of variance; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species.The marked low dose-responsive character of radiation-induced oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells suggested these cells were exquisitely sensitive to irradiation. To determine whether very low ion fluences could elicit measureable changes in reactive species, a modified dosimetry was used to quantify the number of ions/cm2. At these low ion fluences, not every cell incurs an incident ion traversal, so reference to dose becomes less meaningful. Exposure of neurosphere cultures to these very low ion fluences was still found to elicit elevated oxidative stress at similar acute postirradiation times (Fig. 3). Increased levels of ROS and RNS probed through the use of CM-H2DCFDA and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF) dyes respectively, showed variable fluence dependent responses 6 h (Fig. 3A) and 24 h (Fig. 3B) after exposures ranging from 500–30,000 Fe ions/cm2. Fluences as low as 500–3000 ions/cm2 were found to elicit increased oxidative stress at most postirradiation times, where fluence responses ≤1000 ions/cm2 are shown at expanded scale (Fig. 3A1, B1). At 6 h postirradiation ROS and RNS levels rose to 2.5 and 2.1-fold over unirradiated controls respectively, after exposure to 30,000 ions/cm2. One day following low fluence exposures cells exhibited a rapid rise in ROS/RNS levels at lower fluences (≤3000 ions/cm2). At higher fluences, RNS levels continued to rise while ROS levels reached a plateau (Fig. 3B). The increased oxidative stress found after low ion fluences was not the consequence of a highly fluorescent subpopulation of cells, since data represent the mean fluorescence of all cells analyzed, gated only to eliminate debris and dead cells. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Low fluence response for the induction of ROS/RNS after charged particle irradiation. Neurospheres were subjected to 600 MeV/n Fe ions at low ion fluences (500–30,000 particles/cm2) and assayed for ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dyes CM-H2DCFDA and DAF, 6 h (A) and 24 h afterward (B). Lower fluence responses are shown at expanded scale (A1, B1). Low particle fluences were found to cause dose-responsive increases in oxidative stress at each of these early postirradiation times. All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. One-way ANOVA is significant (p<0.0001, A and p<0.003, B) and *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.Neural stem and precursor cells subjected to similar low fluences of 56Fe ions and analyzed over longer postirradiation intervals (36–48 h) routinely showed trends toward increased oxidative species (ROS/RNS) compared with sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 4). This was particularly evident for ROS (Fig. 4A) and at higher fluences levels for RNS (Fig. 4B). At these longer postirradiation intervals the oxidative stress response was more complex and did not show the same dependence on fluence. Relative levels of ROS were in general found to be higher than the relative levels of RNS measured at these times. Low fluence data indicate that very low numbers of ion traversals incurred in a population of irradiated neural stem and precursor cells is sufficient to promote a state of oxidative stress. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Low fluence response for the induction of ROS/RNS after charged particle irradiation. Neurospheres subjected to 600 MeV/n Fe ions at low fluences (500–30,000 particles/cm2) were assayed 36 and 48 h after irradiation for ROS/RNS using the redox-sensitive dyes CM-H2DCFDA (A) and DAF (B). At these longer postirradiation intervals, low particle fluences were still found to elicit increase in oxidative stress over unirradiated controls. At these longer times however, dose-responsive increases were less evident, and elevated nitric oxide was apparent at only the higher fluences levels (≤30,000 particles/cm2). All data expressed as mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent observations and normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. ** p<0.05.Persistent oxidative stress after low dose charged particle irradiation The marked sensitivity of neural stem and precursor cells to changes in redox state caused by low dose charged particle irradiation has indicated that exposure to realistic doses (≤1 Gy) of space radiation can induce oxidative stress. To determine the persistence of such radiation-induced effects, neurospheres subjected to iron ion irradiation at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) were analyzed over the course of 2 months. Neurosphere cultures maintained over these extended postirradiation intervals show a marked persistence of radiation-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 5). Analyses of cells loaded with CM-H2DCFDA indicate that compared to unirradiated controls, there is a trend toward increasing oxidative stress at each of the postirradiation times (Fig. 5A). Dose-responsive increases in ROS/RNS levels are observed 1 and 4 weeks after irradiation, a trend that then breaks down 6 and 8 weeks after initial exposure. The wide variability found in many samples is not unexpected, given the protracted nature of these measurements. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Persistent oxidative stress in neural precursors exposed to 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions. Cells exposed to low dose 56Fe ion irradiation were incubated with either CM-H2DCFDA (A), Mitosox (B), or DAF (C) and analyzed for persistent ROS/RNS, superoxide, or nitric oxide respectively at the indicated times. In each case a trend was observed for elevated oxidative species that persisted over the course of 5–8 weeks. All data were normalized to unirradiated controls set to unity. Error bars represent mean±S.E.M. of two to three measurements.In parallel experiments, cells were also analyzed using the Mitosox dye to assess the level of superoxide persisting after charged particle exposures (Fig. 5B). Compared to data collected with the CM-H2DCFDA dye, qualitatively similar increases in superoxide levels were found after the same doses and postirradiation intervals. Superoxide levels were proportional to dose at earlier times (≤4 weeks), and less so at latter postirradiation times (≥6 weeks), while overall changes were less pronounced when compared to ROS/RNS levels. While variability between replicate samples precluded significance of all data sets shown, there was a clear trend toward elevated superoxide at all postirradiation times. In a separate series of experiments conducted over two experimental campaigns at BNL, analogous experiments were run to quantify any long-lasting changes in the level of nitric oxide (NO) after low dose charged particle exposures. Neurospheres subjected to similar doses and analyzed over the course of 5 weeks were found to exhibit increased NO levels (Fig. 5C). Dose-responsive increases were most notable 3 weeks after irradiation, while the extent of increased radiation-induced NO levels was similar in magnitude to those increases noted for superoxide. As with the other protracted postirradiation analyses, changes did not reach statistical significance when compared to sham-irradiated controls, although trends of increased NO were evident at several time points (Fig. 5C). In vivo measurement of antioxidant capacity To assess the potential impact of irradiation on the antioxidant capacity of the brain, neural tissue isolated from mice subjected to low dose whole body irradiation was subjected to a battery of assays to quantify the activities of selected antioxidants. Brains isolated from animals given 0.1 or 1.0 Gy of γ-irradiation were analyzed for changes in antioxidant levels and enzyme activities 2 and 4 weeks after exposure. At 2 weeks postirradiation there was a significant drop (53%, p<0.001) in the percentage of glutathione expressed as the disulfide form (GSSG) at each dose compared with unirradiated controls (Fig. 6A). This value trended higher by 4 weeks, where the percentage of GSSG was increased by 19% and 12% after 0.1 and 1.0 Gy respectively (Fig. 6A). When expressed as the ratio of GSH:GSSG (Fig. 6B), the data show a significant increase in reduced GSH 2 weeks following irradiation, with a trend toward increased oxidized GSSG 4 weeks after exposure. Catalase activity (mk units/mg) showed a dose-responsive increase at 2 weeks, where 0.1 and 1.0 Gy doses significantly increased activity by 57% and 68% respectively (Fig. 6C). At 4 weeks postirradiation catalase activity returned to background (Fig. 6C). At the earlier 2-week time, SOD activities (U/mg protein) trended higher, with significant increases of 34% (p<0.007) and 26% (p<0.004) for MnSOD (0.1 Gy, Fig. 6D) and Cu,Zn-SOD (1.0 Gy, Fig. 6E) respectively. These increases translated to a significant rise (27%, p<0.02) in total SOD activity 2 weeks following exposure (Fig. 6F). At the 4-week time, SOD activity was also found to return to background levels. Analysis of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity also revealed significant increases of 52% (p<0.0001) and 44% (p<0.0001) 2 weeks following 0.1 and 1.0 Gy respectively, which then declined to unirradiated control levels by week 4 (Fig. 6G). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity measurements showed similar upward trends at both postirradiation times and doses, with a significant increase of 24% (p<0.02) found at 2 weeks after dose of 0.1 Gy (Fig. 6H). Collectively, data show that antioxidant levels were routinely elevated 2 weeks after either irradiation before dropping to controls levels 2 weeks thereafter. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Antioxidant assessment in the irradiated brain. Following irradiation, brains were prepared for the measurement of antioxidant levels (A, B) and various enzymatic activities (C–H). Irradiation with 0.1 or 1.0 Gy led to a significant (p<0.0001) increase in GSH levels at 2 weeks, with a trend toward elevated GSSG at week 4 following irradiation (A, B). Catalase (C) and SOD (D–F) activities were increased significantly (to varying extents) 2 weeks after irradiation, but not at week 4. GPx and GST activities followed similar trends (G, H).

Irradiated mice did not show any signs of distress or physical impairments throughout testing. Further, no motor deficits were observed in the irradiated mice during any of the cognitive tasks. Both groups (control and irradiated) spent a comparable amount of time exploring the two identical objects during training. During testing, sham-irradiated male mice spent significantly more time exploring the novel object compared with the familiar object (p<0.05) (Fig. 7). In contrast, irradiated male mice showed no preference for the novel object (Fig. 7). FIG. 7. Open in a new tab Novel object recognition of sham-irradiated and 56Fe-irradiated male mice. The DI shows reduced exploratory preference for the novel object over the familiar object 2-weeks after irradiation. N=8 mice/treatment. *p<0.05 (two-tailed t-test). DI, discrimination index.Additional testing of the 56Fe-irradiated animals in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) did not uncover any cognitive deficits in spatial memory retention, as both control and irradiated cohorts spent equal amounts of time exploring the target quadrant containing the escape platform for which they were trained (data not shown). Based on these results, additional cognitive testing (NOR) was undertaken on a dedicated cohort of animals 12 weeks after exposure to 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles at doses of 5 and 30 cGy. Animals subjected to 5 or 30 cGy exhibited significant deficits in NOR when analyzed 12 weeks after exposure (Fig. 8). Animals irradiated with 16O particles exhibited significant reductions (67%, p<0.05) at both doses, while animals exposed to 48Ti particles showed a significant reduction (65%, p<0.05) at the higher dose and a trend for lower exploration (50%) at the lower dose (Fig. 8). These data clearly demonstrated that low dose exposure to charged particles leads to impaired NOR performance over extended postirradiation times. FIG. 8. Open in a new tab Impaired recognition memory in mice detected 12 weeks after exposure to 16O or 48Ti particles. The NOR task was used to calculate a DI, which shows that all irradiated cohorts had reduced preference to explore the novel object compared to unirradiated controls. Controls (0 Gy) showed selective preference for the novel object (DI=46.64±5.3). Exposure to 600 MeV/n 16O particles reduced exploration of the novel object significantly (DI=15.7±4.1, p<0.05 at 5 cGy; DI=14.78±11.8, p<0.05 at 30 cGy). Similarly, exposure to 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles was also found to significantly reduce exploration for the novel object (DI=23.74±12.8, p<0.05 at 5 cGy; DI=16.4±6.6, p<0.05 at 30 cGy).Discussion Few studies have investigated the effects of charged particles on neural stem and precursor cells exposed to the low ion fluences expected on a space mission outside the earth's magnetosphere (21, 32). Past work from our lab has characterized the radiation response of multipotent neural cells grown as monolayers to high and low LET radiation, and has shown that following irradiation these cells exhibit a marked rise in acute and persistent oxidative stress that is associated with increased apoptosis, an inhibition of cell cycle progression, and marked radiosensitivity (25, 32, 33). Our present study extends past findings by analyzing multipotent neural cells grown as neurospheres that were exposed to varying doses of charged particles. Present studies also placed an emphasis on very low fluences of HZE particles more typical of the actual space radiation environment, and on analysis of cells over protracted postirradiation times to gauge the long-term consequences of charged particle exposure on astronauts. Neurosphere cultures are heterogeneous populations of multipotent cells, comprised of stem cells, their immediate precursor progeny, along with smaller fractions of cells partially committed to neuronal or glial fates (23). Mixed populations of multipotent cell types would be expected to possess intrinsic differences in radiosensitivity, and past reports using other cell systems support this hypothesis (12, 52). To uncover potential differences in radiation sensitivity, neurosphere cultures were subjected to higher doses of charged particles and analyzed for overall cell survival or sphere forming capacity. Quantification of cell counts or sphere formation 5 days following irradiation revealed a marked difference in the sensitivity of these assays to iron ion exposure. Bulk cell counts showed that the predominant population of neural precursor cells was more sensitive to charged particle exposure than neural stem cells. For the relatively higher doses used in these studies, radiation-induced double-strand break formation was the most likely cause of cell death, as opposed to the inhibition of proliferation. While the dependence of sphere forming assays on stem cells is not without caveats, past work has suggested that the presence of stem cells does promote the formation of spheres (2, 35). The capability of irradiated cultures to re-form spheres after such high doses of charged particles suggests that neural stem cells are more radioresistant than their immediate progeny. Neurospheres subjected to space relevant fluences of charged particles exhibited radiation-induced oxidative stress that was generally found to be dose responsive at earlier postirradiation intervals (<1 week). At longer times postirradiation, radiation-induced changes in oxidative stress were less linearly dependent on dose and showed greater variability and a tendency to plateau. The dose dependency of radiation-induced oxidative stress suggested cause and effect, but also suggested the existence of nontargeted effects. As alluded to above, many of these studies were performed to determine whether doses corresponding to less than one particle traversal/cell led to any significant changes in oxidative stress. Doses delivered over the range of 1–15 cGy (Fig. 2) correspond to 0.041–0.59 average hits/cell (where “hit” indicates traversal of any part of the geometric cross section of the cell), based on an average cellular radius of 6 μm. At these low doses, from 4% to 45% of the cells incur hits after 1 and 15 cGy respectively. Given the paucity of cells traversed at the lowest doses and ion fluences used in these studies, data suggested that direct particle traversals was not a prerequisite for charged particle-induced oxidative stress. Neurospheres irradiated with very low particle fluences were analyzed for changes in reactive species over the following 2 days (Figs. 3 and 4). Depending on time and reactive species, as few as 500 ions/cm2 were found to elicit increased oxidative stress. At this low ion fluence, as few as 1/1770 cells or 1/50 neurospheres were hit (based on an average neurosphere radius of 37 μm at the time of irradiation) by the incident Fe ions. Increasing the fluence of incident ions was in general found to elicit a progressive increase in the levels of ROS/RNS. When fluences were adjusted to hit every neurosphere once, on average, or 1/30 cells (i.e., 30,000 ions/cm2), oxidative stress was usually at a relative maximum within 2 days of exposure (Figs. 3 and 4). Despite the postirradiation variations in temporal response for oxidative stress in cells subjected to low dose exposures, overall trends were observed for increased charged particle-induced oxidative stress. The quality and quantity of damage types to various target molecules in cells subjected to the high ionization densities near the center of a track (track core) will differ from those in cells more distal to the track where secondary electrons (delta rays) produce more dispersed patterns of ionization. While ionization patterns are stochastic, on average the ionization density varies continuously as a function of 1/radial distance2 from the track center (10, 11, 13). Thus the “core” is a term of convenience. The GERM code can be used to calculate this distribution (14). Cellular damage resulting from HZE particles is known to include a high multiplicity of damaged sites within submicron volumes that impedes the repair and recovery of the exposed cells (26). However, superimposed on the population of cells directly traversed by high LET particles are larger populations of cells that received exposure only from the lower LET delta rays at distances greater than a few tens of nanometers. The damage sustained by the latter cells will be of lower multiplicity and will be more effectively managed by cellular damage detection and repair systems. From the GERM code we may estimate that all sites within a cylindrical volume of radius 1.4 μm will receive at least 10 cGy local dose, all sites within a 4.5 μm radius cylindrical volume will receive at least 1 cGy, and all sites within 14 μm will receive at least 0.1 cGy for 600 MeV/n 56Fe. Given a neurosphere of 74 μm in diameter containing about 235 cells, a particle traversing the full diameter will “hit” about six or seven cells. However, on the order of 20 cells will receive exposures above 1 cGy, representing about 1/2 of their volumes. An intermediate number of cells will experience doses>10 cGy over parts of their volumes. However, for exposures above 0.1 cGy almost 1/4th of the cells in the neurosphere will be involved. It is also worth noting that particles simply passing within ∼10 μm of a neurosphere may impart low LET exposures (>0.1 cGy) to neighboring cells, effectively increasing the proportion of “hit” spheres at low fluences. Low LET radiation doses of 1–10 cGy have been shown to be effective as priming doses in adaptive effect investigations and therefore can modulate cell damage detection and repair properties. This may be in part due to changes in mitochondrial function (cytoplasm) and not just to cell nuclear damage (7). Even lower doses of gamma rays (∼0.1 cGy) can modify the frequency of neoplastic transformation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (3). Thus, delta-ray exposures associated with tracks must be considered significant contributors to overall responses of neurosphere cell populations, and may account for some of the resistance observed in irradiated neurospheres at higher doses (Fig. 1). Given the cellular growth geometries of neurospheres and the geometry of tracks, it is highly likely that the oxidative stress response observed under limiting particle fluences can in part be attributed to delta ray exposures many microns away from the track center. Reactive species, emanating from cells hit by cores or peripheries of tracks may then go on to mediate further nontargeted effects. While not the focus of this study, significant published data show that radiation-induced oxidative stress serves as a biochemical mechanism regulating certain nontargeted effects (18, 22, 33, 49). While low dose acute effects may have an adverse impact on mission-specific tasks, performance decrements are not the only potential risks associated with CNS exposure to the space radiation environment. Additional studies were conducted to ascertain the long-term changes to redox state associated with low dose exposure to HZE particles. Cells analyzed over 1–8 weeks following exposure to Fe ions at BNL were found to show increased levels of ROS/RNS at most times (Fig. 5). Given the protracted nature of these measurements, and the inherent differences between individual accelerator campaigns conducted over several years, the wide experimental variability is not altogether unexpected. Rather than over interpret the subtle to more robust fluctuations in the levels of the reactive species measured, it seems more appropriate to comment on the overall trends found. Clearly, over the 2-month postirradiation interval analyzed changes in oxidative stress occurred. The levels of ROS/RNS, superoxide, and NO levels were elevated compared with sham-irradiated controls analyzed in parallel, and increased oxidative stress was not found to be below background levels postirradiation. While the dose dependency of these effects did not reach significance the alterations to the redox state of cells never appeared to stabilize or fall below basal levels. Over the range of applied doses, acute exposure to iron ions led to a perturbation of oxidative stress that did not abate. The data suggest that as a general trend, exposure to charged particles elicits essentially permanent changes to the redox state of surviving cells. Fluorogenic dyes provide convenient readouts for the overall redox state of cells subjected to irradiation, but their usage is associated with several limitations that have recently been reviewed (28). The oxidation of CM-H2DCFDA is susceptible to peroxidase activity, iron signaling, redox cycling, and one-electron oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (·OH), peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and other reactive intermediates (28). The red fluorescence derived from Mitosox may not entirely be due to mitochondrially-derived superoxide, as other oxidants (·OH, ONOO−) can generate alternative species with overlapping fluorescent spectra (28). Similarly, DAF reacts with NO and other NO oxidation products to yield fluorescent adducts (40). Thus, while the complexity of the intracellular redox chemistry precludes direct assignment of fluorescent signals derived from oxidized dyes to specific reactive species or their sites of production, our data does suggest that irradiation elicits an overall imbalance in redox homeostasis that promotes a persistent oxidative stress in irradiated cells. Past work has shown that irradiation disrupts mitochondrial function through alterations in the permeability transition and electron transport thereby increasing release of ROS/RNS (30). Related work from us and others has identified defects in mitochondrial complex II, and possibly mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunit D that are likely to contribute to the elevation in reactive species after irradiation (17, 39). Thus, radiation-induced alterations in mitochondrial function are likely to be responsible for a significant fraction of the persistent oxidative stress observed in these studies. The issue of whether radiation-induced levels of oxidative stress are good or bad in the context CNS functionality is more difficult to ascertain. Increased levels of proxidants found after irradiation may not translate to oxidative injury, a limitation that complicates the assessment of physiological relevance. Further, low dose (<1 Gy) radiation effects are known to differ from those occurring after higher doses, where low dose stimulation of redox signaling may provide neuroprotective effects as opposed to higher dose inhibition of these pathways. Interestingly, these observations fit with the emerging concepts of hormetic dose responses and how they might engage “vitagene” networks to promote neuroprotection [recently reviewed in (9)]. Past work from our lab has found that excess superoxide derived from genetic disruption of SOD isoforms is neuroprotective after cranial irradiation (24, 46). More recent studies from our lab using a transgenic mouse model (MCAT) that overexpresses human catalase targeted to the mitochondria provide further support for the importance of redox balance in the CNS (31). Low dose (proton) stimulation of endogenous neural precursor cell proliferation was attenuated in MCAT mice, while promoting neurogenesis after low (0.5 Gy) but not high dose (2 Gy). Related findings from our group have shown protective radioadaptation in cultured neural stem and precursor cells after low but not high dose exposure to protons and γ-rays (50). Improved survival after low dose exposure could be eliminated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, providing further evidence for the importance of redox homeostasis in irradiated cells. Thus, evidence suggests that low dose exposure and/or physiologic levels of reactive species may promote neuroprotection, at least at the cellular level. It is more difficult to predict how such changes might impact a multifaceted endpoint such as cognition, but redox imbalance may well alter the long-term functionality of the brain. Application of similar dye based approaches to detect transient reactive species in vivo are more complicated, and prompted our analyses of antioxidant levels and enzyme activities in mice subjected to low dose irradiation. The ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione was reduced significantly at both doses 2 weeks after irradiation, which was consistent with the significant increase in activity of all antioxidant enzymes measured at that time (i.e., catalase, total SOD, GPx, and GST) (Fig. 6). Elevated enzymatic activities were found to return to background levels 1 month after irradiation, a time in which the level of GSSG:GSG trended upward to a more oxidized state (Fig. 6). The dynamic response of brain antioxidants to acute exposure suggest a compensatory response to elevated oxidative stress over 2 weeks, which is then attenuated over longer times. While the precise mechanism/s underlying these antioxidant responses is uncertain, it suggests again that changes in redox metabolism could alter oxidative stress levels to impact the functionality of the irradiated CNS. In addition to radiation-induced oxidative stress, heavy ion exposure has been linked to neuroinflammation and altered hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed 2–9 months before (43–45). Alterations to neurogenesis may explain certain observations in earlier (47, 48) and more recent (27) reports of reduced spatial learning in rats exposed to 1 GeV/n iron ions. Other mechanisms involving impaired glutamatergic transmission (37), altered autophagy (42) and synaptic protein alterations (19) are likely to contribute to functional decrements in cognition. Neurocognitive tasks dependent on other nonhippocampal areas of the brain are also altered after heavy ion exposure (4, 5, 34), as exposure to low doses of iron ions was found to impair the ability of rats to conduct attentional set-shifting, suggesting deficits in executive function (34). While the link between radiation-induced oxidative stress and impaired executive function is uncertain, the antioxidant α-lipoic acid was found to prevent certain spatial memory impairments caused by heavy ion exposures (51). While it remains uncertain how the persistent changes in redox state observed following charged particle exposure might impact performance decrements during spaceflight or long-term cognitive health, the impairments in NOR (Fig. 7) seen after low dose 56Fe irradiation support the functional significance of these low dose radiation effects. The deficits observed after 56Fe irradiation on the NOR task did not translate to functional decrements when animals were assessed in the water maze test. Reasons for this are uncertain, but may indicate that neurocognitive sequelae had insufficient time to fully develop over this relatively brief postirradiation (i.e., 2 weeks) interval. The fact that radiation-induced cognitive impairment develops over months to years in patients receiving much higher total doses during clinical radiotherapy supports this idea (8, 38). Further, the MWM interrogates different regions of the brain than does the NOR task (4, 5), and NOR performance may in fact provide a more sensitive indicator of nonhippocampal (perirhinal and prefrontal cortex) dependent deficits caused by irradiation. The foregoing possibilities prompted further investigations into the impact of heavy ion irradiation, where animals exposed to low doses (5 or 30 cGy) of 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles were analyzed 12 weeks later for deficits in NOR. These data show that NOR was impaired significantly at these protracted postirradiation times, where the tendency to explore novelty was reduced on average by 67% for all cohorts compared to sham-irradiated controls (Fig. 8). Given these low doses and protracted times of analyses, these findings are noteworthy, and suggest that exposure to space relevant fluences of charged particles is associated with a risk for developing certain performance decrements. Since animals explore objects equally during familiarization and exhibit no signs of neophobia, deficits in NOR are likely due to impaired learning and/or memory rather than reduced curiosity. Whether or not the chronic trends of elevated oxidative stress found after such exposures are causal and/or contributory to the observed neurocognitive sequelae remain to be elucidated. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate a temporal coincidence between radiation-induced oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction, and suggest a link between altered redox metabolism in the CNS and functional behavioral outcome.Materials and Methods Cell culture Primary neural stem/precursor cells isolated from the mouse subventricular and hippocampal dentate subgranular zones were used for all studies. These cells were grown in DME/F12 (1:1; Invitrogen), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.4%; Sigma), insulin (20 μg/ml; Sigma), progesterone (1.59 nM; Sigma), putrescine (7.7 μg/ml; Sigma), sodium selenite (24 nM; Sigma), apo-transferrin (80 μg/ml; Sigma), heparin (0.76 units/ml; Sigma), epidermal growth factor (200 ng/ml; Biomedical Technologies), and fibroblast growth factor (40 ng/ml; Peprotech). Cultures are passaged three times weekly by mechanical trituration and maintained in T25 flasks kept on an orbital shaker at slow rotation (∼50 rpm) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37°C and maximum humidity. Over the course of these experiments, cultures were maintained between passages 10–15 before irradiation and then passaged as described until the time of analysis. Under these conditions, cells routinely exhibit doubling times of 20–22 h.Animals Mice (C57BL/6J background) were used and all animal procedures were carried out in accordance with  and IACUC guidelines. For antioxidant measurements, 2-month-old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n=30) were used divided as 0 Gy (n=6), 0.5 Gy (n=4), and 2 Gy (n=4), with irradiated groups analyzed 2 and 4 weeks following irradiation. For cognitive studies, 2-month-old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice (n=16) were irradiated with 600 MeV/n iron ions and subjected to NOR or the MWM 2 weeks after exposure. For the assessment of NOR 12 weeks after exposure, animals were irradiated with 600 MeV/n oxygen or titanium ions at BNL.Irradiation Iron ion (600 MeV/n; LET 180 keV/μm) irradiations were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL. For the majority of irradiations (≥1 cGy), dose rates between 5 and 50 cGy/min were used, where spatial beam uniformity was confirmed with a digital beam imager and beam dosimetry was measured with an ion chamber. Further details of this beam have been described (36). At lower ion fluences (500–30,000 ions/cm2), dosimetry was done by means of a count-based cutoff, in which a scintillation counter was used to give a signal for each ion track through it. Signals from the primary ion are well separated, larger and far more numerous than those derived from fragments. A pulse-height discriminator is used to ensure that only the primary ions are counted by the scaler, which in turn cuts the beam off when the desired number of counts is reached. Since fragments represent roughly 2% of the total fluence, this method provides a straightforward method for quantifying dose. Dose can be easily converted to number of ions/cm2; for example, 0.1 cGy of Fe at 600 MeV/n is delivered by 3.6×103 ions/cm2. The counter is 1 cm2 and can accept up to about 105 counts/spill, while the beam can be reduced to 102 ions/cm2 per spill, thereby providing a useful method for measuring dose over the low ion fluences used in this study. The NSRL physics staff performed all dosimetry and further details regarding similar dosimetry setups have been published (53). For all 600 MeV/n 56Fe ion exposures neurospheres were split the day before irradiation. Spheres re-form during this preirradiation interval, approaching diameters of 74±5 μm containing 234±65 cells. For irradiation, cells were gently loaded into 15 ml centrifuge tubes and placed in the beamline horizontally using a low-density polystyrene holder to minimize any scatter from nuclear fragmentation. Tubes were placed within a region of 95% beam uniformity and oriented such that the beam entered from the side of the tube. Calculations using NASA's GERM code indicate that fragmentation of iron ions passing through the maximum depth results in 11% of the fluence from fragments (mostly protons and alphas). Despite the fragmentation, the overwhelming contribution to dose is from primary iron particles. Following irradiation, cells were seeded into flasks or multiwell plates for the analysis of survival and oxidative stress. Culture conditions were carefully optimized to maintain all cells in log-phase growth over each of the postirradiation times and to normalize the initial distribution of cells between flasks for each of the experimental conditions. For in vivo antioxidant measurements, mice were subjected to whole body γ-irradiation (0.1 or 1.0 Gy) using a 137Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 2.07 Gy/min. For the in vivo cognitive experiments, mice were shipped to BNL. After a 1-week acclimation period, the mice were either sham-irradiated or whole body irradiated with 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles at a dose of 0.1 Gy or irradiated with 600 MeV/n 16O or 500 MeV/n 48Ti particles at a dose of 5 or 30 cGy. For 56Fe irradiations, cognitive testing began 1 week after the mice arrived at OHSU (i.e., 2 weeks postexposure) and for 16O or 48Ti irradiations, cognitive testing was conducted at UCI, 12 weeks after exposure.Cell survival and neurosphere assays Irradiated cultures were analyzed for cell numbers and sphere forming capacity to ascertain the impact of charged particle irradiation on stem and precursor cells. Following irradiation neurosphere cultures were either seeded into flasks for the quantification of cell number or into 96-well plates for the determination of sphere forming capacity. Bulk neurosphere cultures were dissociated 5 days following exposure and counted by hemocytometer. Alternatively, irradiated cultures were dissociated the day of irradiation, diluted into 96-well plates and analyzed by eye for the presence of spheres. The number of spheres counted 5 days following exposure was equated to surviving fraction, adjusted by the number of cells seeded per well.Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of redox-sensitive dyes Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to quantify the levels of reactive species in cells subjected to charged particle irradiation. After irradiation and on the day of assay, cells were aliquoted into 24-well plates. Multiple wells were used for the various dyes, doses, and postirradiation times analyzed. The ROS/RNS-sensitive dye 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, 5 μM; Invitrogen), the NO-sensitive dye DAF (5 μM; Invitrogen), or the superoxide-sensitive dye MitoSOX (0.5 μM; Invitrogen) was added 1 h prior to analysis by FACS. Approximately 10 min prior to FACS analysis, neurospheres were mechanically dissociated by trituration into single cell suspensions subjected to FACS analysis. Details regarding antioxidant measurements and cognitive testing can be found online in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ars).Statistical analysis Data is expressed as the mean±S.E.M. of three to four independent measurements and the level of significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, one way) with Bonferroni's multiple comparison and Student's t-tests employing Prism data analysis software (v3.0). For the cognitive test, (ANOVA, one-way) was used to assess group differences in exploratory times, with irradiation as between subject factor. To analyze preference for the novel object, Student t-tests were used. Statistical significance was assigned at a p≤0.05.Supplementary Material Supplemental data Supp_Data.pdf (43.8KB, pdf) Abbreviations Used ANOVA analysis of variance CM-H2DCFDA 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate DAF 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate DI discrimination index FACS fluorescent activated cell sorting GST glutathione-S-transferase HZE High Z and Energy LET linear energy transfer MWM Morris Water Maze NO nitric oxide NOR novel object recognition RNS reactive nitrogen species ROS reactive oxygen species Acknowledgments We kindly thank and appreciate the efforts of the BNL physicists Adam Rusek and Michael Sivertz who provided the critical technical help for ensuring accurate dosimetry and beam delivery.
